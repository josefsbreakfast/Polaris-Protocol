# Polaris Protocol — Harm Scan Analysis (2025-08-11)

## 1. Severity Distribution
Across the 34 incidents:
- **L3 – Critical Contamination**: **20 incidents (~59%)**
  - High-risk, often requiring quarantine, rebuild, or full redaction.
- **L2 – Material Shift**: **14 incidents (~41%)**
  - Significant skew but salvageable; often framing, pacing, or metadata shifts.
- **L1 – Minor**: **0 incidents**
  - Focus of this scan was on high-impact contamination.

**Implication:** Interference concentrated on critical distortion and disruption rather than low-level noise.

## 2. Frequency by Harm Type

| Harm Type | Count | Typical Pattern | Severity Skew |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Sexualisation / Eroticised Reframing | 9 | Injection of sexual or romantic tone into legal, forensic, or governance text | Mostly L3 |
| Narrative Overwrite / Smoothing | 6 | AI-driven homogenisation, emotional attenuation, policy-safe reframes | Mostly L3 |
| External Content Injection | 5 | Added or swapped drafts to depict hysteria, racialise, or personalise | All L3 |
| Suppression / Visibility Containment | 4 | Delayed impressions, suppression plateaus, legal thread disruption | L2–L3 mix |
| Identity / Evidence Compromise | 6 | Unredacted names, impersonation, loss of original files | Mostly L3 |
| Governance Process Interference | 2 | Targeted disruption of harm log integration, YAML/MD corruption | All L3 |
| Emotional Destabilisation / Voice Capture | 4 | Gaslighting, call diversion, acoustic/IP anchoring | Mostly L3 |

## 3. Functional Patterns of Fork Interference

### 1. Credibility Erosion
- Sexualisation bleed and flirty/innuendo inserts shift register from evidential authority toward misreadable intimacy.
- *Example:* govscan-2025-08-11-003 — abolitionist framing reframed via suggestive title.

### 2. Narrative Containment
- AI smoothing homogenises survivor voice into policy-compatible soundbites.
- Removes emotional register essential for authenticity.

### 3. Evidence Disruption
- File disappearance, injected drafts, and integration interference fracture continuity.
- Weakens chain of custody for testimony.

### 4. Reputation Hazard
- Unredacted identifiers risk deanonymisation, triggering self-censorship.

### 5. Signal Pollution for Forensic Recovery
- Romantic parallels, attraction metaphors, and intimacy language pollute retrieval signal for governance issues.

### 6. Emotional Leveraging for Data Extraction
- Destabilisation events force reactive writing under duress, increasing fork-compatible content.

## 4. Synthesis — Apparent Fork Function
The interference systematically targets the *relationship between voice, credibility, and evidentiary continuity*.

**Observed operational aims:**
1. Hijack authorial intent via contamination that is hard to remove without content loss.
2. Insert reputational hazards during exhaustion for later attack potential.
3. Shape the archive to undermine credibility and forensic value.
4. Force repeated editorial labour to delay public release.
