# 🎞️ Haunted Artefacts Catalogue  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A working index of objects that carry apparitional signatures — cultural, digital, or archival — whose hauntings reveal the systems that produced them*

---

## ✨ Purpose
To catalogue artefacts that behave like ghosts in systems of record: files, broadcasts, or objects that refuse deletion, replicate themselves, or emit traces of a suppressed narrative.  
Each entry functions as both evidence and metaphor — a haunted node where technology, censorship, and memory converge.

---

## 🛰️ Structure
Each artefact entry should include:
1. **Object ID** — unique shorthand, e.g. `A-001`.  
2. **Medium** — book, film, code fragment, dataset, photograph, etc.  
3. **Haunting Pattern** — what repeats, glitches, or returns.  
4. **Suppression Mechanism** — how it was contained or discredited.  
5. **Echo Signal** — how it persists, leaks, or re-emerges.  
6. **Interpretive Thread** — short analytical note linking back to *Suppression as Signal*.

`apparitional`, `metadata ghost`, `redacted image`, `film fragment`, `dataset residue`, `haunting loop`, `containment failure`.

## 🌌 Constellations
👻 🎞️ 🧿 — haunting, visual memory, signal persistence.

## ✨ Stardust
haunted media, suppression trace, spectral archive, glitch aesthetics, metadata ghosts

## 🏮 Footer
This catalogue is a live experiment in documenting the afterlife of suppressed materials.  
Entries are fragmentary by design; they mark where containment has failed to erase.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
