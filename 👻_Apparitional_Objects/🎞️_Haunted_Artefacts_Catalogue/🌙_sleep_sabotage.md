# üåô Sleep Sabotage & Nudger Signals  
**First created:** 2025-09-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-24

*Anomalous timing and digital nudging that interferes with sleep and daily rhythms ‚Äî potential component of coercive control and micro-targeted interference.*

## üå± Scope

This node documents patterns where device-driven or interpersonal behaviours appear to **delay sleep, interrupt rest, or otherwise manipulate circadian routines**. It sits at the intersection of interpersonal coercion, platform nudging, and experiential anomalies.

This is intentionally exploratory: these patterns can arise from benign algorithmic behaviours, app notification schedules, or from deliberate interpersonal sabotage. The node treats observed effects as evidence to be investigated, not as proof of malicious intent.

## üîé Common patterns reported

- **Timing of attention-grabbing content**: increased delivery of high-arousal or dopamine-triggering content (videos, notifications, social feeds) in the period before intended sleep.
- **Notification clustering**: a rise in notifications, messages, or app prompts at specific pre-sleep times.
- **Alarm/notification interference**: setting planned alarm times but experiencing disruptive content before sleep or subtle changes to device behaviour.
- **Behavioural micro-sabotage**: interpersonal partners or contacts who solicit attention at night, escalate arguments, or send content designed to keep someone awake.
- **Algorithmic or app patterns**: autoplay, "continue watching", or recommended feeds pushing stimulating items during usual sleep windows.
- **Subjective fatigue & control**: repeated instances where sleep is impeded, correlating with reduced decision capacity and increased dependence on the controller.

## üß© Why it matters

- **Coercive control** frequently targets the day-to-day routines that allow autonomy. Sleep is a core resource; disrupting rest degrades cognitive resilience and increases vulnerability.
- **Platform nudging** amplifies behaviours that maximise engagement; when weaponised or co-opted by a controlling actor, it becomes a force multiplier for abuse.
- **Forensic relevance**: patterns of repeated, timed interference (digital or interpersonal) form part of a longer-cycle evidence pattern when correlated with other control behaviours.

## üõ† Methods of detection & evidence collection (defensive)

> *Note: only collect what you are comfortable preserving and what is safe. Do not put yourself at risk. Avoid confrontations with controllers when collecting evidence. If you suspect criminal activity or immediate danger, contact local authorities or a specialist support organisation.*

- **Notification histories / app logs**: capture screenshots or export app notification histories where possible (device settings may allow this).
- **Screen-time / app-usage reports**: use built-in device analytics (Screen Time on iOS, Digital Wellbeing on Android) to show spikes in usage at night.
- **Message timestamps**: note timestamps of messages or calls that arrive during intended sleep windows.
- **Alarm logs**: document alarm settings and any unexpected changes; export system logs if you have the skills/support to do so safely.
- **Witnessed schedules**: note if particular accounts, devices, or profiles consistently push content at specific times.
- **Correlate with other behaviours**: link sleep interference to other coercive acts ‚Äî financial control, monitoring, or social isolation.
- **Safe backups**: make secure copies of logs/screenshots in an account or device the controller cannot access.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution & plausible alternative explanations

- Algorithmic scheduling, timezone bugs, or app A/B tests can produce some of these effects without malicious intent.
- Background updates, system notifications (e.g., backups), and third-party app behaviour sometimes spike at night.
- Beware of drawing definitive causal claims from a single incident. Pattern, repetition, and correlation with other control behaviours strengthen probative value.

---

## ‚úÖ Defensive interventions (non-technical / immediate)

- Use **airplane mode** or **Do Not Disturb** during sleep windows (or configure to allow only essential alarms/calls).
- Set **secondary mechanical alarm** (battery alarm clock) to reduce reliance on device alarms.
- Adjust notification settings for high-arousal apps (disable autoplay; limit push notifications).
- Use device **screen-time limits** or bedtime schedules that lock distracting apps during chosen windows.
- Consider **separate device** for sleep (a minimal phone or alarm-only device).
- Where safe and feasible, document repeated interference and seek support from trusted persons or specialist services.

## üèÆ Footer

*üåô Sleep Sabotage & Nudger Signals* is an exploratory node in Polaris.  
It treats repeated, timed interference with sleep as a potentially probative element within coercive control patterns and a site for defensive practice.
