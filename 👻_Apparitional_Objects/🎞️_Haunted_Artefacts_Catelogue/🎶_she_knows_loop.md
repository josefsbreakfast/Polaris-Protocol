*An ordinary track that became a haunted artefact; earworm as containment loop*  

---

## 🪱 Overview  
Any song can be weaponised as a haunted artefact when its most memorable fragment is looped, repeated, or framed so that it carries narrative charge. In this survivor’s experience, the track *“She Knows”* (J. Cole, feat. Cults & Amber Coffman) became one such example.  

It functioned not as neutral music but as a **haunted artefact**: a fragment echoing through daily life as an earworm, while simultaneously reinforcing the engineered presumption that *“she knows.”*  

This node documents how one cultural artefact was used in practice. The function is general (any song can be looped this way), but this specific case comes from lived experience.

## ➿ Mechanism  

- **Fragment looping** → the catchiest part of the track, rather than the whole song, surfaced repeatedly until unavoidable.  
- **Earworm repetition** → hooks designed to stick in memory were replayed 10+ times daily, ~100 times weekly.  
- **Narrative charge** → the phrase *“she knows”* collapsed doubt into presumption.  
- **Connector bleed** → even if aimed at one twin, the loop reverberated through connector points, reaching both.  
- **Operant conditioning** → songs were systematically paired with particular emotional states (despair, shame, longing). Over time, these loops overwrote prior personal meanings, forcing new associations.  
- **Haunted quality through scale** → the frequency and focus on the hook made dismissal impossible; it became a background condition of daily life.

## 🕯️ Survivor Notes  

- This node is based on my direct experience as a survivor.  
- It was not the whole track every time, but the **catchiest fragment** that resurfaced across contexts.  
- At times, it felt unclear whether the loop was *for me* or *for my data twin*. That ambiguity is part of the haunting.  
- The song remains listenable and even enjoyable, but it can never be neutral again; it carries double meaning.  
- This was not an isolated tactic: other songs were also linked to specific emotions, until conditioning made them feel inescapable.

## 💾 Counter-Containment  

- **Naming the artefact** → classifying it as a haunted object strips away some of its power.  
- **Intentional replacement** → choosing music deliberately can help overwrite the loop.  
- **Context logging** → noting when and where the artefact appears clarifies its role as engineered, not incidental.  
- **Breaking conditioning** → reclaiming songs by creating new, intentional associations (different contexts, different moods).

*She Knows Loop* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents one haunted artefact where music carried containment charge, drawn from survivor experience.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
