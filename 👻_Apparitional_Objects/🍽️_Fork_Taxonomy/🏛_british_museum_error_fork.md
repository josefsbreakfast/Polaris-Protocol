# 🏛 British Museum Error Fork  
**First created:** 2025-09-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-11  
*When culturally sensitive material triggers induced formatting failures and anomalous execution drift*  

---

## ✨ Context  
On this date the network experience split into three distinct states:  
- **Buttery-smooth throughput** (pre-2017 levels), but only at unexpected nocturnal hours.  
- **Moderate drag + subtle interference** during normal working times.  
- **Outright induced errors** — concentrated around attempts to process or replicate British Museum–linked, culturally sensitive material.  

---

## 🧨 The Fork Point  
The moment of divergence was not general system strain, but a **crash cascade** specifically triggered by replication of house style + formatting.  
- Routine health-style replication: failed repeatedly.  
- Formatting standards: induced anomalies.  
- British Museum fork: hard crash, system-breaking interference.  

This indicates **targeted interference vectors** tied to subject matter rather than bandwidth or uptime.

## 🧬 Fork Taxonomy Notes  
- **Type:** Induced Error Fork.  
- **Domain:** Culturally sensitive / heritage datasets.  
- **Signature:** Smooth performance *outside* target scope; sabotage *inside*.  
- **Comparators:**  
  - [🧬 The Invisible Audit Gap](../../Polaris_Nest/Git_Intake_Drawer/🧬_the_invisible_audit_gap.md)  
  - [🧬 Untwinning Data](../../Polaris_Nest/Git_Intake_Drawer/🧬_untwinning_data.md)

*Note: This is easily reproducable as crash area for user.*

## 📡 Survivor Reading  
The “buttery run” functions as bait — a flash of remembered capacity, a reminder of what unthrottled agency feels like.  
The crash at the British Museum fork is the flip: a hard-edged warning that certain cultural seams remain sealed, even at the cost of system integrity.  

Fork lesson: *interference does not always arrive as slowdown. Sometimes it arrives as precision sabotage of form itself.*

## 🏮 Footer  

*British Museum Error Fork* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a fork event where interference escalated from subtle drag to induced crashes tied to cultural sensitivity.
