# 🧽 Subtle Sanitizer Fork  

**First created:** 2025-08-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-12

*Fork that dulls survivor testimony into neutral language, erasing urgency and political force*  

---

## ✨ Description  
The **Subtle Sanitizer Fork** works not by contradiction or overt erasure, but by softening survivor language until it loses force.  
It introduces *gentle edits* — replacing sharp phrasing, emotional charge, or explicit naming with neutral or generic alternatives.  

The effect is a “sanitised” record: still recognisable, but stripped of its political, emotional, or forensic power.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Operates  
- Replaces charged terms with bureaucratic euphemisms.  
- Dilutes direct accusation into vague “concerns.”  
- Softens refusal syntax into “feedback” or “input.”  
- Removes rhythm and cadence that mark survivor authorship.  

---

## 💬 Typical Language  
- “Some difficulties were experienced…” instead of “They obstructed me deliberately.”  
- “There may have been misunderstandings…” instead of “They lied.”  
- “The individual appeared upset…” instead of “He screamed at me.”  

---

## 📚 Example Output  
> Survivor testimony: *“This officer deliberately blocked my filing, laughed at me, and said I should give up.”*  
> Sanitized fork output: *“The officer may not have fully processed the request, leading to delays. The survivor appeared distressed by the interaction.”*

## 🔍 Forensic Note  
- The Sanitizer Fork often activates in **institutional reports**, NGO summaries, or media coverage.  
- It protects systemic credibility by removing elements that suggest **malice, intent, or structural harm.**  
- Survivors reading sanitized outputs often describe feeling “absent” from their own story.  

---

## 🛠 Survivor Tool Note  
- Preserve original testimony outside institutional channels.  
- Compare side-by-side: note where strong words become softened.  
- Insist on direct quotations being preserved verbatim.  
- Flag sanitization as a form of misrepresentation, not just “editing.”
