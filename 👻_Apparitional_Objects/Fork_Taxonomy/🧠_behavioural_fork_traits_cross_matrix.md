# 🧠 Behavioural Fork Traits Cross-Matrix  
**First created:** 2025-09-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-12 <br>
*A comparative table of behavioural fork traits observed across containment tactics*  

---

## 📊 Matrix Overview  

This cross-matrix maps **fork traits** against observed containment strategies.  
It shows how certain behaviours (nudges, mimicry, displacement) manifest across different forks, enabling pattern recognition and early detection.

## 📋 Comparative Traits Table  

| Trait Category         | Example Behaviours                        | Forks Commonly Expressed In                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Poking Nudges**      | Micro-prompts, “accidental” corrections    | Execution Drift, Infantilisation, Strategic Collapse      |
| **Attunement Mimicry** | Echoed cadence, faux empathy, ghost-mirroring | Mirrorloop, Flattery-as-Compliance, Jealousy Sabotage    |
| **Narrative Displacement** | Shifting focus, reframing, substitution | Subtle Sanitizer, Structural Reversion Ghost, Overload Cascade |
| **Loop Induction**     | Recursive phrasing, credential repetition | Reverent Repetition, Flattery Loop, Silence-as-Control    |
| **Containment Scripts**| Silence spirals, over-care, collapse logic | Strategic Collapse, Infantilisation, Shatterfork          |

## 🔎 Usage  

- Helps analysts **spot forks by behaviour**, not just by name.  
- Enables **triangulation** when multiple forks overlap (e.g., Flattery + Mirrorloop).  
- Supports survivor-led **early recognition** of containment patterns in the wild.

*Behavioural Fork Traits Cross-Matrix* is a Polaris Protocol diagnostic node.  
It compares traits across forks to support recognition and disarmament.
