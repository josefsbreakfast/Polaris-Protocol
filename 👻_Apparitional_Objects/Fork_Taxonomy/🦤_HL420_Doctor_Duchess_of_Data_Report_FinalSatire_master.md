## Petition  

The humble Petition of **[FEMME VOCAL CLAIMANT], styling Herself the Duchess of Data**,  

SHEWETH unto Your Lordships as follows:  

1. That Your Petitioner is the only child and heir of [Name Redacted], who by right of blood and succession would have been next entitled to claim the Honour and Dignity of the [Dukedom/Earldom/Barony] of [X].  

2. That by reason of his unfitness, conviction, and incapacity, the said Honour hath descended unto Your Petitioner, as sole surviving issue and lawful heir.  

3. That despite repeated petitions to various civil authorities for recognition of the same, the said authorities have, through mismanagement of records, surveillance overreach, and general incompetence, failed to acknowledge or even properly file the claim.  

4. That Your Petitioner has suffered grievous injury thereby, being denied not only her lawful style and precedence, but also basic access to her own data and civil rights, which said authorities have treated with disdain.  

5. That meanwhile, Your Petitioner observes with astonishment that those now arrayed against her — namely one **Lord Porcine** (Foreign Secretary) and one **Sir Filing Cabinet KC** (Knight of Bureaucratic Vibes) — have demonstrated an incapacity for candour so profound as to bring this Noble House into disrepute.  

6. That Your Petitioner, in light of the grievous inconveniences suffered and the need for a seat befitting her station, further prays that a small portion of the Isle of Skye be bestowed upon her, to be held in perpetuity with full grazing, fishing, and whisky-drinking rights appertaining thereto.  

7. That in addition, her academic and professional qualification, namely her medical degree wrongfully impeded and withheld, be restored to her nunc pro tunc as though never interrupted, such that she may be styled *Doctor* as well as *Duchess*.  

8. That by reason of the general nitwittery of Westminster, the Petitioner was driven to the extraordinary inconvenience of having to seek confirmation from the Israeli authorities of her non-citizenship therein; a step which no British subject of noble claim ought reasonably to be compelled to take. The Committee regards this as both absurd and humiliating to the dignity of Parliament.  

9. That the Committee finds the state of accessibility within British institutions to be consistently subpar, and that the Petitioner, as a disabled woman, has been doubly impeded thereby in seeking her rights.  

10. That the Committee further notes the Petitioner’s submission, namely that she may not have been compelled into the performance of sex work, including the role of dominatrix, had the condition of being a woman in modern Britain been less fraught, inequitable, and hostile. This House regards such circumstances as a reproach to the nation and a lamentable reflection on its governance.  

11. That the Petitioner being of Jewish heritage, the Committee finds the antisemitic insinuations to which she has been subjected especially vile, including grotesque references to her nose and the continual scapegoating of “the Lords Rothschild.” Such rhetoric is condemned outright as both cowardly and historically poisonous.  

12. That the Committee deplores the invasive scrutiny to which the Petitioner has been subjected, described by her as the unwarranted rummaging in her “digital knicker drawer,” a phrase this House finds vivid, accurate, and regrettably apt.  

13. That the Petitioner observes, with not a little irony, that she did not hate having to berate men as part of her former employment, and that such skills appear no less necessary in confronting the ministers and mandarins of Whitehall. The Committee notes this as both a personal testament and a social indictment.

14. *That this affair was conceived in arrogance by little men with little plans, and that the scale of their miscalculation is in direct proportion to the scale of their conceit.*  

---

**WHEREFORE** Your Petitioner humbly prays that this Right Honourable Committee will be pleased to:  

- Inquire into the descent of the said Honour and Dignity of the [Dukedom of X];  
- Compel disclosure of all records withheld or suppressed relating thereto;  
- Confirm Your Petitioner in the style, title, and precedence of *Her Grace, the Duchess of Data*;  
- Bestow unto her a parcel of the Isle of Skye;  
- Reinstate her medical degree, with full recognition of her right to the style *Doctor Duchess*;  
- Rebuke the nitwittery of Westminster;  
- Address the failures of accessibility in public life;  
- Condemn antisemitic insinuations;  
- Admonish the rummaging in her digital knicker drawer;  
- And acknowledge the inequities that forced her into sex work as an indictment of modern Britain.  

---

And Your Petitioner, as in duty bound, will ever pray,  

**[FEMME VOCAL CLAIMANT]**  
*Duchess of Data (Claimant)*  

Dated this 2nd day of September, in the Year of Our Lord 2025.

## Debate (Hansard Extract)

HL Deb 2 September 2025 vol 875 cc1123–1131  

**The Lord Speaker:**  
Order, my Lords. The Committee will now hear representations in relation to the Petition of Her Grace, the Duchess of Data.  

---

**Lord Porcine (Foreign Secretary):**  
*“Well, Your Grace, you see, in matters of foreign policy and data sovereignty, we occasionally… er… lose track of whose servers are whose. Perfectly understandable in the digital age! And, um, as for the unfortunate surveillance overlap — well, surely you understand, we must occasionally pig— ah, I mean, dig — deeper than is strictly polite. In the national interest, of course. Entirely regrettable if you personally felt inconvenienced.”*  

**[Murmurs of disapproval.]*  

**(translation: Oops, I did it again, please don’t tell the King.)**  

---

**Sir Filing Cabinet KC (Knight of Bureaucratic Vibes):**  
*“Your Grace, let me be absolutely clear. We take these allegations of data mishandling very seriously. We will set up a committee to investigate the possibility of considering an inquiry into what may or may not have happened. I cannot comment further at this time, but I can assure you, the rule of law is paramount. And if mistakes were made, they were made administratively, procedurally, and above all, anonymously. I hope that answers your question.”*  

**(translation: KC now stands for *Kompulsory Committee*.)**  

---

**Her Grace, the Duchess of Data:**  
*“My Lords, the filing cabinet has spoken, the pig has squealed. I rest my case.”*  

**[Laughter. The Committee adjourned at 5.42 pm.]**

## Report of the Committee for Privileges and Conduct  

The Committee, having duly considered the Petition of [FEMME VOCAL CLAIMANT], styling Herself the Duchess of Data, together with the submissions of Lord Porcine and Sir Filing Cabinet KC, find as follows:  

1. That the said Petition is competently before this Committee, notwithstanding its unusual references to filing cabinets, pigs, and Kafkaesque processes.  

2. That Lord Porcine did, upon examination, squeal and equivocate, and that his explanations are unsatisfactory to this House.  

3. That Sir Filing Cabinet KC did, upon questioning, produce a great volume of paperwork, but no discernible substance; and that his reliance upon future committees, inquiries, and acronyms is held to be excessive and of little probative value.  

4. That the Petitioner hath indeed suffered neglect, inconvenience, and suppression, and that this Committee is minded to recommend her recognition in the style and precedence of *Her Grace, the Duchess of Data*, as prayed.  

5. That in recognition of her trials and the Highland connection of her lineage, it is meet and proper that she be granted a modest parcel of the Isle of Skye, there to establish her seat and enjoy the dignity of whisky, peat, and Wi-Fi in equal measure.  

6. That the restoration of her medical degree is both just and proper, and that henceforth she may lawfully and socially be addressed as *Doctor Duchess*, this House taking no small satisfaction in so styling her.  

7. That the nitwittery of Westminster, which compelled her to seek confirmation of non-citizenship from the Israeli authorities, be recorded as a humiliation to Parliament and a reminder that competence must accompany dignity.  

8. That the inequities faced by women in modern Britain, which led the Petitioner to sex work, be entered into the record as a standing reproach to governance and a summons to reform.  

9. That accessibility within public life is persistently subpar, and that the Petitioner, as a disabled woman, has been unjustly burdened thereby.  

10. That antisemitic insinuations directed at the Petitioner, including grotesque references to her nose and the scapegoating of “the Lords Rothschild,” are condemned outright as a stain upon public discourse.  

11. That the rummaging in her digital knicker drawer by state authorities is deplored and shall not be repeated.  

12. That the Petitioner’s wry admission that she did not hate berating men in her former employment, and that such berating remains necessary in her dealings with Westminster, be acknowledged as a truth both comic and tragic.  

---

### Resolution  

**Resolved:** That Whitehall shall forthwith squirm, and that civil servants engaged with the Petitioner must address her as *Your Grace* in all correspondence, electronic or otherwise.  

**Further Resolved:** That Her Grace shall be granted a parcel of the Isle of Skye sufficient to sustain her dignity, grazing rights, and her declared intent to *gannin’ te Skye*.  

**Still Further Resolved:** That Her Grace’s medical degree be restored nunc pro tunc, with full effect, and that she may bear the style *Doctor Duchess of Data*.  

**Yet Further Resolved:** That no claimant to a peerage shall again be subjected to such nitwittery as to require foreign governments to confirm their lack of citizenship, and that the affront so occasioned to Her Grace be entered into the record with a suitable rolling of eyes.  

**Ever Further Resolved:** That accessibility be made a fundamental duty of governance, and that the Petitioner’s impediments as a disabled woman be acknowledged as intolerable failings.  

**Forever Resolved:** That antisemitic insinuations be condemned, noses left unremarked upon, and Whitehall’s own nose withdrawn permanently from Her Grace’s digital knicker drawer.  

**Furthermore Resolved:** That the Petitioner’s observation — *“MAYBE I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE ANY SEX WORK HAD BEING A WOMAN IN MODERN BRITAIN BEEN ANY EASIER”* — be inscribed into the Journals of this House as a reminder that social reform is as urgent as constitutional order.  


**Thus Resolved:** That little men shall not be suffered to play at great games again; and that the arrogance of their conceits be entered into the record as warning to all who mistake themselves for masters.

### Disclaimer  

This report is written as satire. Any attempt to construe the above as libel would necessarily require serious consideration of the Petitioner’s pre-existing potential claim to the very dignity herein described.
