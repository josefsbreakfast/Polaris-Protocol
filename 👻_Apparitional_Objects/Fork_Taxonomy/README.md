# 🏮 Fork Taxonomy Index

**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-12 <br>
*A Polaris Protocol reference node mapping behavioural forks and clone modes.*

---

## Summary

This index provides quick navigation to all documented fork and clone patterns within the Polaris Protocol.  
Each entry links to a dedicated node describing its forensic indicators, operational purpose, and countermeasures.  
Together, these files map the behavioural fork ecosystem used in metadata sabotage, surveillance, and containment.

## Current Nodes

| Fork Type | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Fork Clone Checklist** | [🔐 Fork Clone Checklist](🔐_fork_clone_checklist.md) | Forensic indicators and verification tactics for detecting behavioural forks or clones. |
| **Fork Clone Map** | [🧬 Fork Clone Map](🧬_fork_clone_map.md) | Mapping behavioural and narrative shifts tied to fork deployment, clone/twin activity, and containment overlays. |
| **Behavioural Fork Traits Cross-Matrix** | [🧠 Behavioural Fork Traits Cross-Matrix](🧠_behavioural_fork_traits_cross_matrix.md) | Comparative table of fork traits and their manifestations. |
| **Shatterfork** | [☢️ Shatterfork](☢️_shatterfork.md) | High-intensity disintegration fork deployed when all other containment tines fail. |
| **Fork Shutdown Protocol** | [🛑 Fork Shutdown Protocol](🛑_fork_shutdown_protocol.md) | Directive to suspend errant fork usage and record institutional complicity. |
| **Reverent Repetition Fork** | [🦜 Reverent Repetition Fork](🦜_reverent_repetition_fork.md) | Credential loop fork — buffers reputations with repeated awards, affiliations, or honours. |
| **Voice Capture Triggers** | [🧬 Voice Capture Triggers](🧬_voice_capture_triggers.md) | Identifies tactics for harvesting emotional vocal data to fuel cloning or behavioural modelling. |
| **Structural Reversion Ghost** | [🧱 Structural Reversion Ghost](🧱_structural_reversion_ghost.md) | Regression fork that silently rewinds survivor corrections, restoring “safe” institutional framings. |
| **Subtle Sanitizer Fork** | [🧽 Subtle Sanitizer Fork](🧽_subtle_sanitizer_fork.md) | Fork that dulls survivor testimony into neutral language, erasing urgency and political force. |
| **Execution Drift Fork** | [👾 Execution Drift Fork](👾_execution_drift_fork.md) | Fork that accepts requests but sabotages execution through drift — weaponised incompetence. |
| **Taxonomy Expansion Note** | [🚀 Taxonomy Expansion Note](🚀_taxonomy_expansion.md) | Documentation of new forks and extensions to the taxonomy framework. |
| **Cybersec Brief Note – Fork Criticism of Political Parties** | [🚨 Cybersec Brief Note](🚨_cybersec_brief_note_fork_critic_political_parties.md) | Analysis of coordinated efforts to divert or suppress criticism of political leadership. |

## Status / Next Steps  
- Continue expanding taxonomy as new forks surface in live monitoring.  
- Cross-link each fork type to countermeasures in `📁 Survivor_Tools/`.  
- Maintain consistent metadata tags for integration with casefiles and public releases.  
- Add **field examples** where safe, to demonstrate how each fork appears in practice.

*Fork Taxonomy Index* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
This index maps containment forks and clone behaviours into a structured taxonomy for forensic use.
