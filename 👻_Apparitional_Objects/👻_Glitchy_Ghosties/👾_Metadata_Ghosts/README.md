# 👾 Metadata Ghosts  
**First created:** 2025-12-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-06  
*Ghosts born from administrative error, corruption, and bureaucratic residue.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**Metadata Ghosts** are artefacts produced when a system mishandles identity data.  
They are not narratives or inferences; they are **record-level anomalies** — remnants, duplicates, contradictions, or corrupted entries that behave like independent entities.

These ghosts haunt the **administrative stack**:  
databases, case files, identity registries, risk scores, benefits systems, CRM platforms.

A metadata ghost survives deletion, refuses correction, or misattributes itself to the wrong person.  
It is an administrative afterlife.

## 👾 What Belongs Here  

A node belongs in **👾 Metadata Ghosts** if it involves:

- orphaned records  
- phantom accounts  
- deleted-but-not-deleted entries  
- contradictory database states  
- persistent tagging errors  
- mutated metadata that reattaches incorrectly  
- shadow identity artefacts  
- “wrong person, right data” or “right person, wrong data”

These ghosts harm at the **bureaucratic** level:  
misassessment, misbenefit, misflagging, miscategorisation.

Examples:
- NHS record duplicated or inverted  
- student finance records with phantom loans  
- local authority case notes from another person merging with yours  
- metadata fragments resurfacing after deletion  
- perpetual identity errors that survive every correction attempt

## 🔧 How to Log a Metadata Ghost  

1. **System Layer** — which institution/system produced it  
2. **Record Error** — duplication, contradiction, corruption  
3. **Impact Surface** — benefits, ID, risk scores, assessments  
4. **Persistence** — how it resisted deletion or correction  
5. **Cross-System Effects** — did it replicate across agencies?  
6. **Interpretation** — what it reveals about administrative failure

## 🏮 Footer  
A metadata ghost is a wrong fact with a life of its own.  
It is the bureaucracy dreaming — and misremembering.
