# 🪹 Network Ghosts  
**First created:** 2025-12-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-06  
*Phantom social graphs — nests built from correlations, with no “you” inside.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**Network Ghosts** are apparitions created when a system infers social relationships, communities, or affiliations that do not exist.  
They arise not from your data or behaviour, but from **correlation scaffolding**: algorithmic guesses about who your “people” are.

A network ghost is a *hollow nest* — a structure built from traces, but empty of truth.

These ghosts cluster around:
- People You May Know  
- inferred political affiliations  
- falsely assumed communities  
- recommendation adjacency  
- algorithmic groupings built from weak signals

## 🪹 What Belongs Here  

A node belongs in **🪹 Network Ghosts** if it involves:

- imaginary social clusters  
- misinferred friendships or affiliations  
- recommendation engines assuming false communities  
- political or ideological clustering done algorithmically  
- shadow graphs built from someone else’s data  
- “you’re in this group” suggestions when you’re not  
- algorithmic hallucination of networks  

Examples:
- being recommended extremist groups after watching a single unrelated video  
- fictional communities built by the TikTok or Twitter algorithm  
- “people you may know” from a job you never had  
- false adjacency to demographic groups via weak-click patterns  
- algorithmic attempts to infer who you “belong” with

## 🔧 How to Log a Network Ghost  

1. **Inferred Community** — what group the system imagined  
2. **Trigger** — what minimal action or correlation caused the inference  
3. **Adjacency Map** — who or what you were grouped with  
4. **Error Source** — metadata overlap, demographic inference, click adjacency  
5. **Propagation** — did multiple platforms replicate the error?  
6. **Interpretation** — what this ghost hints about surveillance or social mapping

## 🏮 Footer  
Network ghosts are the friends the algorithm thinks you have — and the worlds it builds around you without asking.
