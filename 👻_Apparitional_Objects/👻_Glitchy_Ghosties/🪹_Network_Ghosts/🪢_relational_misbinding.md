# 👻 Network Ghost — Relational Misbinding

**Status:** working description  
**Scope:** principle-level ghost (not a field log)

## What this ghost is

**Relational Misbinding** describes a network-level ghost where a system incorrectly infers *social proximity* between unrelated individuals and begins treating them as a relational unit.

This is not about explicit links (contacts, shared accounts, shared IPs).
It emerges after prolonged exposure to:
- data brokers,
- reputational management systems,
- risk-scoring or enrichment pipelines,

where **behavioural property data** is weighted more heavily than declared relationships.

Over time, the network begins to act as if the users are:
- partners,
- family members,
- or otherwise mutually influential actors.

---

## How it manifests

Typical signs include:

- Algorithmic placement of one user’s content, ads, or risk signals *relative to* another user’s behaviour  
- Cross-contamination of inferred interests, risks, or “safety” flags  
- One user’s actions subtly changing the visibility, friction, or treatment of the other  
- Systems behaving as though separation between the two would be “anomalous”

This often appears **without any visible linking artefact** the users can inspect or correct.

---

## Why this happens (mechanism, not intent)

Many network models optimise for **predictive efficiency**, not relational truth.

If two users:
- appear repeatedly in the same enrichment layers,
- are handled by the same intermediaries,
- or are subjected to similar narrative or reputational processing,

the system may infer *functional coupling*.

Once inferred, this coupling can become self-reinforcing:
- shared behavioural priors,
- shared risk envelopes,
- shared suppression or amplification dynamics.

At that point, the “relationship” exists **only inside the system** — but it still has effects.

---

## Why this is a ghost

This relationship:
- cannot be seen directly,
- cannot be explicitly queried,
- and often cannot be corrected by either user.

It is:
- **apparitional** (real in effect, absent in interface),
- **network-native** (emerges between systems, not within one),
- and **sticky** (persists even after surface conditions change).

Users may only notice it indirectly, through shifts in friction, visibility, or attribution.

---

## What this ghost does to people

Relational Misbinding can produce:
- confusion (“why does this affect me?”)
- inappropriate responsibility attribution
- reputational bleed
- risk transference
- pressure to manage or monitor someone else’s behaviour

Critically, it can **simulate intimacy or complicity where none exists**.

---

## Boundaries of this concept

This ghost:
- does **not** require conspiracy
- does **not** imply conscious pairing by humans
- does **not** mean users are actually linked

It describes a *systemic inference error* that becomes operationally real.

---

## Notes

This ghost is especially relevant in environments involving:
- safeguarding,
- risk scoring,
- counter-extremism,
- fraud detection,
- reputational containment,
- or “trust & safety” optimisation.

It often precedes more visible forms of network interference.
