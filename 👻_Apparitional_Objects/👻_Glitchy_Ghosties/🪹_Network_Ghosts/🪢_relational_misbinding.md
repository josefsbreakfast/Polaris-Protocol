# 🪢 Relational Misbinding
**First created:** 2025-12-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-21  
*A network ghost where systems infer social proximity between unrelated individuals and treat them as a relational unit.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

**Relational Misbinding** describes a network-level apparitional effect in which digital systems incorrectly infer a meaningful relationship between two or more unrelated individuals.

This ghost does not rely on explicit links such as shared accounts, contacts, or identifiers.  
Instead, it emerges through prolonged exposure to **data brokerage, reputational management, risk scoring, or enrichment pipelines**, where behavioural property data is prioritised over declared relationships.

Once established, the system begins to act *as if* the individuals are partners, family members, or mutually influential actors — despite no such relationship existing outside the network.

---

## 🧿 How It Manifests

Relational Misbinding may present through:

- Algorithmic placement of one user’s content, ads, or risk signals relative to another’s behaviour  
- Cross-contamination of inferred interests, reputational attributes, or “safety” flags  
- One individual’s actions subtly altering friction, visibility, or treatment applied to the other  
- Systems behaving as though separation between the individuals would be anomalous or unstable  

Crucially, these effects typically appear **without any inspectable or correctable linkage** visible to the affected users.

## 🧠 Mechanism (Inference, Not Intent)

Many networked systems optimise for **predictive efficiency** rather than relational accuracy.

If individuals:
- repeatedly appear within the same enrichment layers,
- are handled by the same intermediaries,
- or are processed through similar narrative, safeguarding, or reputational frameworks,

the system may infer *functional coupling*.

Once inferred, this coupling can become self-reinforcing through:
- shared behavioural priors,
- shared risk envelopes,
- shared suppression or amplification dynamics.

At this stage, the “relationship” exists only within the system — but produces real effects.

## 👻 Why This Is a Ghost

Relational Misbinding is:

- **Apparitional** — real in consequence, absent in interface  
- **Network-native** — arising between systems rather than within a single platform  
- **Persistent** — often surviving changes to surface conditions or user behaviour  

The inferred relationship cannot usually be:
- directly observed,
- queried,
- or formally corrected.

Its presence is inferred only through secondary effects.

## 🫀 Effects on People

This ghost can generate:

- confusion or misplaced self-scrutiny  
- inappropriate attribution of responsibility  
- reputational bleed between unrelated individuals  
- risk transference  
- pressure to monitor or manage another person’s behaviour  

In practice, it can **simulate intimacy, complicity, or shared risk where none exists**.

---

## 🚧 Boundaries of the Concept

Relational Misbinding:

- does **not** require conspiracy or human coordination  
- does **not** imply conscious pairing by operators  
- does **not** mean individuals are actually linked  

It describes a **systemic inference error** that becomes operationally real through repetition and persistence.

*🪢 Relational Misbinding* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents a principle-level network ghost used to explain how inferred relationships can arise and persist without consent, visibility, or relational truth.
