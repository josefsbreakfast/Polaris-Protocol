# 🪦 Haunting Ghosts  
**First created:** 2025-12-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-06  
*Ghosts born from the return of past selves, past data, and past contexts.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
A **Haunting Ghost** emerges when the past refuses to stay past.  
These ghosts are not errors, and not behaviours — they are **returns**: resurfacing loops, resurfaced memories, archived content erupting into the present.

A haunting is caused when a system reanimates an obsolete version of you:  
an old tag, an old preference, an old dataset, an old assumption.

They arise in moments where the system “remembers wrong.”

## 🪦 What Belongs Here  

A node belongs in **🪦 Haunting Ghosts** if it involves:

- old content resurfacing unexpectedly  
- platform déjà vu (loops of the same recommendations)  
- legacy errors returning after being fixed  
- algorithmic insistence on a past version of the user  
- “ghost preferences” from years ago  
- outdated flags or tags resurrected in new contexts  
- archive residue that speaks today  

Examples:
- advertising targeting you as if you were still 16  
- Spotify pushing a long-dead genre phase  
- Google Photos resurfacing painful images unprompted  
- old ID entries reattaching after being corrected  
- ghost data resurrecting after a system migration

## 🔧 How to Log a Haunting Ghost  

1. **Origin** — which past dataset or event is returning  
2. **Form** — resurfaced content, loop, tag, archive  
3. **Emotional Payload** — nostalgia, dread, shock, dissonance  
4. **Temporal Drift** — how old the data is  
5. **Systemic Cause** — archive sync, migration error, legacy algorithm  
6. **Interpretation** — what this haunting says about memory and forgetting

## 🏮 Footer  
A haunting ghost is a past self with unfinished business — dragged forward by a system that never learned to forget.
