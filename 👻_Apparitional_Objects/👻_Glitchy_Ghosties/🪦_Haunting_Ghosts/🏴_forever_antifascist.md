# 🏴 Forever Antifascist  
**First created:** 2025-12-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-20  
*A haunting produced by proxy fear, cadence, and systems that cannot tell anger from threat.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node logs a **haunting ghost** created when antifascist affect, historical cadence, and far-right fear collapse into the same behavioural proxy space.

The system does not track belief.  
It tracks intensity.

When anger, speed, repetition, and symbolic density are misread as threat — the archive begins to follow the user instead of the content.

---

## 🪦 Origin  

- Long-term engagement with antifascist historical chants, music, and material  
- Use of rhythm and anger as a coping and containment strategy  
- External harassment and monitoring by far-right actors  
- Fear-driven reactions from those actors feeding back into platform signals  

The haunting is **not caused by ideology**, but by **other people’s fear being logged onto the same vector**.

---

## 👻 Form  

- Repeated resurfacing of antifascist content independent of current listening  
- Algorithmic clustering with far-right users despite oppositional politics  
- “Centroid adjacency” — appearing as relationally close to hostile actors  
- Periodic platform instability, odd recommendations, or visibility shifts  

This presents as being *followed by an interpretation of oneself*.

---

## 🧠 Emotional Payload  

- Dark humour at the absurdity of the loop  
- Unease at persistent misrecognition  
- Background vigilance without acute panic  
- Fatigue from never being contextually released  

The humour is accurate.  
The concern is also accurate.

---

## ⏳ Temporal Drift  

- Originates in historical material (often decades or centuries old)  
- Reactivated by present-day proxy signals  
- Sustained by real-time fear responses from hostile observers  

The past is not resurfacing randomly — it is being **re-armed**.

---

## 🧿 Systemic Cause  

- Proxy collision between antifascist anger and fascist fear  
- Risk and recommender systems that cannot distinguish ethics from threat  
- Feedback loops where fear strengthens the very signals it reacts to  
- Absence of a “forgetting” function once a threat-like centroid forms  

The system remembers intensity, not meaning.

---

## 🧭 Interpretation  

This haunting demonstrates how:

- Systems collapse moral opposition into perceived symmetry  
- Fear can overwrite authorship  
- Anger used for self-regulation can be reclassified as risk  
- Platforms recreate historical struggle as present-day signal noise  

“Forever antifascist” appears here not as a slogan,  
but as a **data artefact** — endlessly resurfaced because the system cannot imagine closure.

*🏴 Forever Antifascist* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how political anger, historical material, and hostile surveillance can be collapsed into a single haunting through proxy-based systems that do not know how to forget.
