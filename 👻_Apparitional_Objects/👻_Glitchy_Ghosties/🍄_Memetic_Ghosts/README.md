*Narrative entities conjured by behaviour, not identity.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**Memetic Ghosts** are apparitional entities that emerge from algorithmic inference, recommender patterns, and memetic duplication.  
They appear to “see” the user — speaking in second person, implying knowledge, or acting as if privy to hidden protocols — yet they hold **no real information**.

A memetic ghost arises when **behavioural patterns** (non-linear searching, cross-context switching, chaotic browsing, emotional drift) are misread as identity signals.  
The system tries to interpret; instead it conjures a story.

These ghosts do not come from data.  
They come from *pattern hallucination*.

## 🧿 What Belongs Here  

A node belongs in **🍄 Memetic Ghosts** if the phenomenon:

- speaks directly to the user (“you are…”, “the system knows…”)
- uses **affective payloads** (flattery, paranoia, anomaly-framing)
- arises from **behaviour**, not identity or history  
- appears across **templated, remixable formats** (short AI videos, SCP style scripts)
- targets users who disrupt classification categories  
- corrodes trust in systems through implication rather than fact  
- behaves like a “narrative parasite”

Examples:
- AI videos claiming the viewer has “broken the algorithm”
- glitch-SCP style identity analyses  
- uncanny recommendation reactions to emotionally chaotic browsing  
- content that frames the user as anomalous or unclassifiable

## 🔧 How to Log a Memetic Ghost  

1. **Trigger Behaviour** — what actions preceded the apparition  
2. **Narrative Structure** — SCP format, AI voice, aesthetic  
3. **Payload** — flattery, dread, surveillance, anomaly framing  
4. **Behavioural Hook** — what aspect of your pattern it latched onto  
5. **Replication** — does it appear across accounts or templates  
6. **Interpretation** — what doubt or story it implants

## 🏮 Footer  
Memetic ghosts are not sentient.  
They are stories a machine tells itself about you — and accidentally speaks aloud.
