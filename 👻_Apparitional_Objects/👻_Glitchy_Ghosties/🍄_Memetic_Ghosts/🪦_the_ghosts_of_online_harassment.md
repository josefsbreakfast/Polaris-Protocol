# 🪦 The Ghosts of Online Harassment  
**First created:** 2025-12-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-09  
*Why digital harm rarely ends when the humans stop, and how the internet preserves threat-shadows long after the event.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Online harassment appears, to institutions, as a **discrete incident**:  
a message sent, a comment posted, a threat issued, a case logged.

But for the person targeted, the harm becomes an **environment**.

Because digital systems do not forget, correct, or decay on human timescales, harassment produces **residual artefacts** that survive long after perpetrators have vanished. These artefacts often contain the *semantic shape* of danger—death, slurs, impersonation, malign implication—without the *agency* of danger.

This node explores how online abuse transforms from an event into a *persistent ambient signal*, and why survivors continue to encounter “ghosts” of threats in search results, SEO spam, data broker leaks, and automated content churn.

## ✨ Key Ideas  

### 1. **The Event Ends. The Trace Does Not.**  
Digital ecosystems replicate:

- posts,  
- cached pages,  
- scraped text,  
- SEO junk,  
- obituary spam,  
- data broker records,  
- foreign mirrors,  
- bot-generated biographies.

A single harassment incident can yield **dozens of copies**, none of which require a live perpetrator.  
The human stops.  
The data keeps going.

### 2. **Threat Semantics Without Threat Agency**  
Residual artefacts often contain:

- your name,  
- the word *death*,  
- slurs,  
- impersonation,  
- defamation,  
- false narratives.

They **feel** like threats because they carry the *shape* of harm.  
But they have **no sender**, **no motive**, and **no current audience**.

This produces a category of harm best described as:

> **passive threat resonance.**

### 3. **Residual Threat Echoes (RTE)**  
When a nervous system has previously survived targeted abuse,  
encountering debris like:

- “fake obituary” pages,  
- “X is dead” SEO templates,  
- autogenerated slander,  
- scraped harassment remnants,

triggers the same internal circuitry as danger—even when the content is meaningless.

The **form** matches trauma memory.  
The **source** does not.

### 4. **Why Systems Misunderstand the Survivor’s Experience**  
Institutions measure harm by:

- active perpetrators,  
- ongoing contact,  
- present-tense threats.

Survivors encounter harm through:

- recurrent search pollution,  
- data shadows,  
- algorithmic residue,  
- identity mis-indexing,  
- infinite replication of old material.

To the system: *“The case is closed.”*  
To the survivor: *“The environment still contains me.”*

### 5. **Digital Decay Does Not Follow Human Time**  
Offline harm ends when:

- people leave,  
- situations change,  
- time passes.

Online harm ends when:

- caches expire,  
- mirrors die,  
- content scrapers stop,  
- data brokers purge stale files,  
- SEO farms collapse,  
- archive bots let go.

Most of these conditions **never occur**.

Thus:  
> **Harassment persists as a data ecosystem long after it has ended as a human behaviour.**

### 6. **Ghost Harm vs Active Harm**  

| Active Harassment | Ghost Harassment |
|-------------------|------------------|
| human intent | no intent |
| targeted | ambient |
| dangerous | unsettling |
| temporal | persistent |
| emotional hostility | semantic residue |
| requires intervention | requires literacy |

Ghost harm is *structural*, not interpersonal.

## 🧰 Mechanism  

1. Harassment occurs (slurs, threats, defamation).  
2. Bots and scrapers ingest it.  
3. SEO farms generate derivative trash.  
4. Data brokers misfile or replicate the content.  
5. Obituary and “news” generators misinterpret or embellish.  
6. Search engines propagate the noise.  
7. Years later, the target encounters “ghosts” of the original harm.

This is **not ongoing targeting**.  
It is **non-agential accumulation**.

---

## 🌫️ Survivor Experience  
Ghost harassment often feels like:

- “the harassment never stopped,”  
- “someone is still thinking about me,”  
- “I’m being implied dead,”  
- “this is a passive threat,”  
- “I can’t trust the environment,”  
- “why does this still exist if no one is doing it?”

These interpretations are **rational** under trauma:  
the *shape* of harm is present.  
The *agent* of harm is not.
