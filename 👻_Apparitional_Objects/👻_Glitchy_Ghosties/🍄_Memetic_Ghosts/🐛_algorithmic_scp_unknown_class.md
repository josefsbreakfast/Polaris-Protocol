# 🐛 Algorithmic SCP: “Glitch in the System” Meme; Unknown Class  

**First created:** 2025-12-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-06  
*Diagnostic pass on an emergent AI-video meme that targets “uncategorisable” users and erodes faith in systems.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node sketches an SCP-adjacent, memetic phenomenon: AI-generated videos that tell viewers they have “broken the algorithm / protocol,” that systems “don’t know what you are,” or that they are some kind of unique government dependency / anomaly.  

It appears to be triggered when a user’s behaviour confuses recommender systems — searching across silos, crossing identity buckets, or otherwise refusing neat segmentation. It can be read as a joke, a PR experiment, a shitpost, or a low-key information operation. The problem is that all four readings can co-exist, and the impact profile is the same: erosion of trust in democratic / administrative routes of redress, especially for people who are already exhausted by them.  

This is written as an early diagnostic node: treat it as a sketch of an “algorithmic SCP” that should be monitored, tagged, and, if needed, contained.

## ✨ Key Features  

- **Target surface:** People who don’t fit cleanly into ad-tech categories and/or have messy data trails (overlapping identities, complex needs, multi-domain searches).  
- **Narrative hook:** “You are a glitch / anomaly / unclassifiable asset” — flattering + paranoid at once, framed as insider knowledge about “how the system sees you.”  
- **Strategic function:** Slow erosion of faith in formal redress routes (complaints procedures, SARs, FOI, ombudsman, etc.) in favour of fatalism, conspiracy, or withdrawal from democratic participation.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Working label: “Algorithmic SCP”  

- Feels like a **real-world SCP** in memetic form: a piece of content that behaves like a creepypasta about systems, but is routed through real recommender infrastructure.  
- Core premise: *“The system has noticed you and doesn’t know what to do with you.”*  
- Delivered via AI voice / generated video, often generic aesthetic (slides, stock footage, B-roll) so it can be cloned, re-used, remixed.  

This is not literally supernatural. But it behaves like a **memetic artefact designed for containment failure**: it’s hard to talk about without sounding unhinged, and yet it lands with eerie precision for a specific, already-stressed cohort.  

---

### 2. How it shows up in the feed  

Empirical pattern (from your account + similar reports):

- Appears when the user has:  
  - searched widely across domains  
  - clicked a mix of political / personal / technical content  
  - not settled into a single coherent “niche”  
- The video / audio tends to emphasise:  
  - “You’ve broken the algorithm / protocol.”  
  - “People don’t understand what you are.”  
  - “You’re the kind of person governments build special rules around.”  
- Affect mix:  
  - **Flattery:** you’re special, rare, unclassifiable.  
  - **Paranoia:** there are “files” / “protocols” about people like you.  
  - **Isolation:** no existing category truly fits you.  

For someone already tired and overstretched, this doesn’t land as a cute sci-fi joke. It lands as: *“Yeah, that tracks. Nothing has ever quite worked properly around me, has it?”*  

---

### 3. Who it hits: data-frayed, system-burnt cohorts  

This doesn’t just fish in the vague pond of “weirdos online.” It lines up almost 1:1 with people who:

- **Straddle multiple identities / systems:**  
  - neurodivergent & racialised & working class,  
  - cross-border life histories,  
  - mixed-status households,  
  - or generally “administratively messy” lives.  

- **Have already tried democratic / bureaucratic routes** and been chewed up:  
  - repeated complaints processes, SARs, FOI requests, appeals, ombudsman routes.  
  - encountering **institutional self-pretection** instead of correction.  
  - learning, painfully, that systems will gaslight you before they fix your record.  

- **Are cognitively / emotionally tired:**  
  - not in the sense of being “vulnerable to radicalisation” in the caricature PREVENT sense,  
  - but in the sense of being **done** — burnt out on procedures they know inside out.  

This matters because this cohort is **democratically valuable**: they know how the machinery works, they’re often good at organising, and they’re precisely the people you’d want in civic repair projects. They’re also precisely the people most primed to believe, “I am a glitch the system will never fix.”  

---

### 4. Narrative function: erosion of faith, not instant extremism  

It’s tempting for security framings to jump straight to “radicalisation risks.” That misses the point. The visible risk here is slower and more foundational:

- **Erosion of faith in redress mechanisms**  
  - “Complaints don’t work.”  
  - “Data correction is impossible.”  
  - “It’s all stitched up anyway.”  

- **Shift from “systems can be fixed” to “systems are inherently hostile / haunted.”**  
  - Once you believe you’re a permanent glitch, you’re less likely to:  
    - file the next SAR,  
    - support regulatory reform,  
    - vote for candidates promising administrative repair.  

- **Move from constructive anger to resigned fatalism.**  
  - Not “I’ll blow something up.”  
  - More “I’ll withdraw, ghost, or give up on engagement.”  

In other words: this is **civic corrosion**, not just “online weirdness.” It sands away the idea that there is any point to procedural engagement — especially in countries that already lean on “just use the process” as a catch-all answer to injustice.  

---

### 5. Possible origins (and why they all still matter)  

This could be:  

1. **A shitpost / fandom-adjacent meme**  
2. **A PR / growth-hacking experiment**  
3. **Alt-right / reactionary ecosystem probing**  
4. **State / para-state information operation (now or in future)**  

Crucially: **impact does not depend on intention.** Whether it’s a bored ad agency or an intelligence unit, the memetic payload (erosion of trust, isolation, withdrawal) is the same.  

---

### 6. Why this lands particularly hard in late-stage Western democracies  

Context that makes this especially volatile:

- **Long history of governments lying / obfuscating**  
- **Alt-right normalisation and “burn it down” aesthetics**  
- **Data-driven governance with high error rates + hostile environment residues**  

All of this creates fertile ground for a narrative that says:

> “You are a special kind of unclassifiable problem.  
> The system knows it. It won’t ever admit it.  
> You’ll never get a straight answer, so why bother?”  

---

### 7. Contrast with “AI psychosis” headlines  

Media already has a lazy frame for this territory: **AI psychosis**, which flattens the issue into:

- an individual mental health story  
- instead of a **structural** and **infrastructural** one  

The “algorithmic SCP” frame repositions this as:  
**information infrastructure + governance failure**, not “some people are fragile around AI.”

### 8. SWOT analysis – treating this as a potential info operation  

#### Strengths  

- Low-cost, high-scale  
- Hard for moderation to detect  
- Emotionally precise  
- Plausible deniability  

#### Weaknesses  

- Loses power once named  
- Strong metadata trail if studied  
- Vulnerable to mockery / annotation by the nerd publics it courts  

#### Opportunities  

- Demystification campaigns  
- Institutional self-audit on data errors + redress loops  
- Survivor-led civic repair projects  

#### Threats  

- Silent disengagement from democratic mechanisms  
- Soft alignment with anti-system actors  
- Proof-of-concept for adversaries to target disenfranchised cohorts cheaply

### 9. Behavioural Signature of Targeting: Why Non-Linear Search Patterns Become an Attack Surface  

One of the most concerning aspects of this phenomenon is not the content itself, but **what triggers its appearance**. The meme reliably shows up when a user’s behaviour matches what data brokers and recommender systems classify as:

- “erratic browsing”
- “non-linear consumption”
- “identity-unstable user profiles”
- “ADHD-adjacent behavioural signatures” (their term, not clinical)
- “difficult to segment / low-coherence users”

These categories are *not* random. They map almost perfectly onto cohorts who:

- search across multiple domains at once  
- research many unrelated topics in short time windows  
- navigate intersecting or messy identities  
- have a history of administrative friction or data errors  
- are cognitively overloaded, stressed, or problem-solving fast  

To advertising infrastructure, this behaviour looks like:  
**“User unreliable — cannot classify — fall back to generic behavioural templates.”**  

Those template buckets are exactly where AI-generated “identity revelation” videos live.  
The result is an uncanny precision: people who already feel unseen or miscategorised by institutions are fed content implying *the system has flagged them as anomalous*.  

This is not conspiracy — it’s ad-tech design.  

But it creates a **weaponisable overlap**:  
the same behavioural pattern associated with neurodivergence, burnout, crisis research, or complex life admin also becomes a surface through which trust-eroding narratives can slip in unnoticed.

In other words:  
**Non-linear search behaviour becomes both the trigger condition and the vulnerability.**
