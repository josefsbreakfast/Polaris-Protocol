*Memetic ghosts: informational entities that behave as if they recognise you.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**Glitchy Ghosties** houses *memetic ghosts* — uncanny informational artefacts that arise not from your data, nor your past, nor your social graph, but from your **behavioural patterns**.  

A memetic ghost is conjured when recommender systems, pattern recognisers, or algorithmic inference engines misread your activity as a coherent identity signal.  
They speak in second person.  
They imply hidden protocols.  
They feel personalised even when they are templated.

They do not know you.  
They only know the shape of your drift.

## What Defines a Memetic Ghost
A ghost belongs here if it:

- **addresses the user directly** (“you are…”, “the system has noticed…”)  
- behaves as though it has **knowledge or access** it cannot possibly have  
- attaches to **behaviour**, not identity  
- emerges from **algorithmic or memetic structures**, not bureaucratic ones  
- corrodes trust in systems through **tone, implication, and vibe**  
- spreads through **replicable templates** (AI videos, SCP formats, chain-tropes)  
- targets users with **non-linear or system-confusing patterns**

These ghosts are not errors.  
They are side-effects of the machine trying too hard to interpret you.

## Examples of Glitchy Ghosties
- algorithmic SCP-style videos claiming “you’ve broken protocol”  
- AI narrators implying you are “unclassifiable”  
- identity-analysis templates triggered by chaotic browsing  
- uncanny “you are different from most users” content  
- personalised-seeming creepypasta generated on demand  

Each specimen is a narrative parasite.  
A little voice conjured by statistical inference.

## Logging a Memetic Ghost  
1. **Trigger Context** — the behaviour that preceded it.  
2. **Narrative Form** — voice, template, structure, mimicry.  
3. **Payload** — flattery, paranoia, classification, doom.  
4. **Target Surface** — what behaviour it seemed to latch onto.  
5. **Replication Pattern** — does it appear across formats or accounts?  
6. **Interpretation** — what trust, doubt, or story it tries to plant.

Memetic ghosts arise at the edges of understanding — where systems attempt to read a person and instead conjure a story.
