# 👻 Glitchy Ghosties  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A fieldbook for recording small digital hauntings—moments where systems stutter, reveal memory, or act as if remembering.*

---

## Purpose
To document the apparitional behaviour of code, platforms, and archives when they momentarily break character.  
A “glitchy ghostie” is a fleeting signal: an auto-fill that repeats a lost name, a file that won’t stay deleted, a caption that writes itself twice.  
Each sighting matters not for its magnitude but for what it discloses—proof that the machine is haunted by its own training data.

## How to Log a Ghostie
1. **Timestamp** – when it appeared.  
2. **Surface** – where it manifested (platform, file, object).  
3. **Glitch Type** – repetition, flicker, self-correction, bleed-through, echo.  
4. **Human Response** – confusion, amusement, fear, recognition.  
5. **Residual Trace** – screenshot, log line, or recollection.  
6. **Interpretive Note** – what the ghostie might be trying to say.

## Categories
- **Echoes** – words, sounds, or gestures that reappear unsummoned.  
- **Refusals** – files or systems that resist closure.  
- **Bleeds** – private content surfacing in public fields.  
- **Mimics** – AI or automation repeating human tics.  
- **Flickers** – UI anomalies that suggest presence.  
- **Remnants** – metadata fragments that persist post-deletion.

## Notes on Tone
Write ghosties as field notes, not horror stories.  
Keep description factual, almost scientific; let the unease arrive through precision.  
Avoid sensationalism: these are ordinary hauntings, not monsters.

Every system dreams.  
Ghosties are what it mutters in its sleep.
