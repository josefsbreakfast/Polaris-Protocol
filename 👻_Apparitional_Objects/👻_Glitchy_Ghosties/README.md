*The Polaris fieldbook for digital ghosts — the taxonomy of apparitional behaviour across systems, data, memory, and networks.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**Glitchy Ghosties** is the parent directory for all ghost-like phenomena observed in digital, bureaucratic, or algorithmic environments.  
A “ghost” in Polaris terms is not supernatural:  
it is an artefact of system behaviour that feels alive, intentional, or personally targeted.

Ghosts emerge when systems:
- misremember  
- misinfer  
- miscategorise  
- crosswire  
- or try to interpret the human in ways beyond their capability

This directory defines the **four families of ghosts** and provides a framework for logging, studying, and cross-referencing them.

# 🧿 The Four Ghost Families

## 🍄 1. Memetic Ghosts  
*Behaviour-triggered narrative entities.*  
Ghosts that arise from recommender systems, algorithmic inference, or memetic templates.  
They “speak” as if they recognise you: uncanny, second-person, SCP-like.

Lives in: **Glitchy_Ghosties/🍄_Memetic_Ghosts/**

---

## 👾 2. Metadata Ghosts  
*Errors that behave like entities.*  
Contradictory, orphaned, or corrupted records that refuse deletion or correction.  
They haunt your administrative shadow.

Lives in: **Glitchy_Ghosties/👾_Metadata_Ghosts/**

---

## 🪦 3. Haunting Ghosts  
*Your past behaving like it’s still present.*  
Old content loops, resurfacing data, legacy errors, or algorithmic déjà vu.  
A ghost of *you that used to be*.

Lives in: **Glitchy_Ghosties/🪦_Haunting_Ghosts/**

---

## 🪹 4. Network Ghosts  
*Phantom social graphs.*  
Inferred associations, imagined communities, algorithmic guesses about your affiliations.  
A nest built from correlations — with no “you” inside it.

Lives in: **Glitchy_Ghosties/🪹_Network_Ghosts/**

# 🧭 How to Classify a Ghost  
Use the following questions:

1. **Is it a data problem?**  
   → Metadata Ghost  

2. **Is it your past returning uninvited?**  
   → Haunting Ghost  

3. **Is it a behaviour-triggered narrative that feels personalised?**  
   → Memetic Ghost  

4. **Is it the system imagining your relationships or community?**  
   → Network Ghost  

If multiple apply, choose the *primary mechanism*, not the vibe.

# 📘 How to Log a Ghost  
Every ghost entry should include:

1. **Timestamp**  
2. **Surface** (platform, database, system)  
3. **Ghost Type** (memetic, metadata, haunting, network)  
4. **Trigger Conditions** (behaviour, search, action)  
5. **Manifestation** (appearance, message, anomaly, inference)  
6. **User Effect** (emotion, confusion, erosion, friction)  
7. **Residual Evidence** (screenshot, quote, behaviour trace)  
8. **Interpretation** (what it reveals about the system)

# 🌌 Constellations  
👻 🧿 🛰️ 🪬 — apparitional register; diagnostic lens; algorithmic ambience; narrative instability.

# ✨ Stardust  
ghost taxonomy, apparitional objects, system anomalies, metadata drift, memetic entities, network inference, algorithmic hauntings

Ghosts are not accidents.  
They are the places where the system’s story about itself breaks and the truth leaks through.
