# 🪙 Token Switching & Relationship Integrity Audit — Executive Overview  
**First created:** 2025-11-10 | **Last updated:** 2026-08-12  
*Operational guide for identifying and correcting pseudonym and role-direction errors across justice and safeguarding data systems.*  

---

## 🧭 Purpose  

To ensure that pseudonymisation (“tokenisation”) and relational fields (`victim_of`, `offender_of`, `related_to`) remain stable across system migrations, exports, and research datasets.  

The audit detects:  
- Token duplication or “token switching”  
- Role inversion or data-twinning  
- Gaps in propagation of data corrections  

---

## 🧩 Why It Matters  

Even anonymised data can contaminate downstream systems if two people share a token or if relational fields lose directionality.  
This audit protects:  
- Victim confidentiality  
- Offender-management accuracy  
- Institutional credibility and legal compliance (UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, Section 170 offences)  

---

## 🧮 Key Questions Auditors Ask  

1. Have pseudonym tokens ever been re-issued or rotated?  
2. Are lookup tables between token generations encrypted and reconciled?  
3. Are role fields (`victim_of`, `offender_of`, `related_to`) always populated and non-symmetric?  
4. Do API joins use **person-level** rather than **case-level** keys?  
5. How quickly do data corrections propagate to mirror systems?

## 🧱 How to Read the YAML Template  

The companion file `🧾_token_integrity_audit_template.yaml` defines:  
- **Audit scope** — systems and date range  
- **Checks** — token lineage, mapping tables, role directionality, joins, audit trails  
- **Metrics** — collision rate, reversal rate, propagation lag  

Non-technical reviewers can skip YAML details and read the *Summary findings* section once populated.

## 🕊️ Deliverables  

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Token-collision report** | Flags duplicate pseudonym IDs across systems |
| **Directionality matrix** | Confirms victim/offender roles preserved |
| **Propagation timeline** | Shows time from correction → mirror update |
| **Recommendations log** | Prioritised fixes and policy updates |
