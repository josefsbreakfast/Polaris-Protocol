# 🌙 Everyday Containment  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*How containment operates in ordinary life — social, digital, emotional, bureaucratic, and linguistic registers.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
**Everyday Containment** traces how the logic of containment migrates into daily experience.  
Where **💞 Containment Theory** models the field itself, this cluster observes its micro-expressions:  
the small boundaries, suppressions, etiquettes, and algorithmic nudges that hold everyday life in place.  

Containment here is not an exceptional event but a *habit of systems*:  
a reflex that manages risk, smooths emotion, filters attention, and regulates visibility.  
It’s what makes a person hesitate before posting, what turns a workplace “procedure” into a quiet silencing,  
what transforms privacy settings into self-curation, and what allows a feed to look alive while slowly constricting.

## 🧩 Included Nodes  

| Node | Focus |
|------|--------|
| 🧾 **Institutional Micro-Containment** | bureaucratic and administrative mini-boundaries; forms, protocols, and delays |
| 💡 **Algorithmic Attention Loops** | how digital infrastructures reward and restrict expression simultaneously |
| 💬 **Containment in Language and Etiquette** | politeness, euphemism, and conversational containment as social regulation |

Future nodes may include *domestic containment*, *intimacy and disclosure*, or *public-space protocols*.

## 🧠 Conceptual Notes  

- **Micro-Suppression as Maintenance** — daily containment preserves the stability of larger systems.  
- **Affective Gating** — feelings are channelled through acceptable registers (professionalism, irony, calm).  
- **Algorithmic Civility** — platforms engineer a balance between outrage and decorum to sustain engagement.  
- **Admin as Theatre** — bureaucracy translates human uncertainty into controlled delay.  

Together these form the *texture* of containment:  
the felt sense of living within invisible boundaries that we ourselves help enforce.

*🌙 Everyday Containment* is a lived-systems cluster of the **Containment Studies** constellation in the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how containment manifests in ordinary life, translating large-scale control into intimate gestures of compliance and care.
