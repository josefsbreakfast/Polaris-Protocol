# 🌀 Containment/Détente Cycle  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Legacy model showing the oscillation between tension and release.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node preserves the **classical containment–détente loop** for contrast with newer models.  
It depicts the historical logic of Cold-War management as a self-stabilising system — useful to understand what the newer, field-based theories supersede.

---

## 🧩 The Four Phases  

| Phase | Function | Feedback Type | Emotional Register |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Containment** | Boundary construction | Positive (escalatory) | Fear, vigilance |
| **Stalemate** | Saturation, fatigue | Neutral drift | Anxiety, exhaustion |
| **Détente** | Controlled relief | Negative (stabilising) | Hope, restraint |
| **Re-Containment** | Renewal of conflict | Positive (re-escalatory) | Betrayal, moral rearmament |

The sequence forms a **homeostatic loop** rather than a binary; détente functions as the system’s pressure valve.

---

## 🧠 Reflection  
The loop is stable but limited: it assumes static actors and repeatable outcomes.  
Modern containment forms — adaptive, probabilistic, co-evolutionary — emerge precisely where this loop breaks.

*🌀 Containment/Détente Cycle* is a historical reference node within the **💞 Containment Theory** cluster.  
It documents the legacy model that newer Polaris theories reconfigure into dynamic, living systems.
