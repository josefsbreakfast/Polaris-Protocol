# ⚛️ Containment as Coupled Waveform Theory  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Container and containee as simultaneous waveforms in continuous interaction.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Rather than two static entities, container and containee form a **coupled system of oscillation**.  
Each influences the other’s amplitude, phase, and frequency.  
Policy, narrative, and emotion are the *observable collapses* of these overlapping waveforms.

## 🧩 Core Ideas  

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Phase Interference** | Alignment creates détente (constructive), misalignment yields escalation (destructive). |
| **Decoherence** | High-frequency noise — information overload, propaganda — shortens system memory. |
| **Energy Transfer** | Information and attention act as energy moving through the coupled field. |
| **Medium Change** | New technologies or cultural shifts alter the propagation medium itself. |

## 🧮 Symbolic Schema  
Two coupled Schrödinger-like functions:  

\[
i\hbar \frac{d\psi_c}{dt} = H_c\psi_c + g\psi_t \quad ; \quad i\hbar \frac{d\psi_t}{dt} = H_t\psi_t + g\psi_c
\]  

\(g\) = coupling constant (permeability).  
Containment intensity = interference amplitude over time.

*⚛️ Containment as Coupled Waveform Theory* is a living node of the **💞 Containment Theory** cluster.  
It models containment as co-vibration and mutual modulation, revealing control and resistance as parts of one waveform ecology.
