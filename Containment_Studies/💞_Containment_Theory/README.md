### 🧠 **Interpretive Note — Practical Indeterminability in Governance**  
In governance as in physics, indeterminability is not metaphysical — it’s computational.  
No system can process, predict, or store all the information required to maintain total control.  
Decisions about *where to stop calculating* become the hidden architecture of containment:  
every border, law, or policy is a **precision limit** disguised as certainty.  
 
Classical containment theory treated these limits as solvable errors;  
contemporary containment recognises them as **constitutive features** —  
the necessary noise that keeps a living system alive.

## 🧭 Orientation  
**Containment Theory** begins where Feynman left off — with the recognition that what appears stable is only **practically determined**, not truly fixed.  
Just as classical physics concealed uncertainty inside the limits of its measurements, classical geopolitics and governance conceal instability inside the language of control.  
Containment has always included drift; it is not the opposite of freedom but its medium of modulation.

This cluster gathers the analytic frameworks that re-imagine containment as a **dynamic, adaptive field**.  
It moves beyond the Cold-War binary of *containment versus détente* and into models that treat both container and containee as **simultaneous, evolving waveforms** — systems coupled through feedback, learning, and phase interference.  

Here, containment is not a boundary but a *relationship of phase, feedback, and adaptation* — a field through which information, emotion, and power travel, mutate, and learn.  
Each node explores a different formal dimension of that field: waveform coupling, co-evolution, temporal governance, and systemic topology.

## 🧩 Included Nodes  

| Node | Focus |
|------|--------|
| 🌊 **Containment as Dynamic Field Topology** | replaces borders with probability clouds and phase-space dynamics |
| ⚛️ **Containment as Coupled Waveform Theory** | interference, resonance, and decoherence between container and containee |
| 🧬 **Containment as Co-evolutionary Ecology** | mutation, adaptation, and feedback between control and resistance |
| 🪞 **Containment & Détente as Temporal Governance** | control of rate and scope, not binary state |
| 🌀 **Containment/Détente Cycle** | legacy loop model retained for contrast and historical lineage |

## 🧠 Conceptual Notes  

- **From Boundary to Field** — containment is modulation of movement and probability, not spatial exclusion.  
- **From Reaction to Coupling** — both sides co-evolve; neither is static.  
- **From State to Phase** — “policy” is a momentary measurement of a continuous interference pattern.  
- **From Stability to Learning** — every act of containment teaches the contained how to adapt.  
- **From Certainty to Practical Indeterminacy** — control operates only within computational and perceptual limits; beyond them lies living noise.

These models are not alternatives to political realism but its *quantum extension*: they treat geopolitics, institutions, and narratives as wave-based ecologies of adaptation.

*💞 Containment Theory* is a core cluster of the **Containment Studies** series in the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It reframes containment from static control to living relation — a system of mutual adaptation and probabilistic motion.
