# 💞 Containment Theory  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Formal models for understanding containment as a living system rather than a static wall.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
**Containment Theory** gathers the analytic frameworks that re-imagine containment as a dynamic, adaptive field.  
It moves beyond the Cold-War binary of *containment versus détente* and into models that treat both container and containee as **simultaneous, evolving waveforms**.

Here, containment is not a boundary but a *relationship of phase, feedback, and adaptation* — a field through which information, emotion, and power travel, mutate, and learn.  
Each node in this cluster explores a different formal dimension of that field: waveform coupling, co-evolution, temporal governance, and systemic topology.

## 🧩 Included Nodes  

| Node | Focus |
|------|--------|
| 🌊 **Containment as Dynamic Field Topology** | replaces borders with probability clouds and phase space dynamics |
| ⚛️ **Containment as Coupled Waveform Theory** | interference, resonance, and decoherence between container and containee |
| 🧬 **Containment as Co-evolutionary Ecology** | mutation, adaptation, and feedback between control and resistance |
| 🪞 **Containment & Détente as Temporal Governance** | control of rate and scope, not binary state |
| 🌀 **Containment/Détente Cycle** | legacy loop model retained for contrast and historical lineage |

## 🧠 Conceptual Notes  

- **From Boundary to Field** — containment is best read as modulation of movement and probability, not spatial exclusion.  
- **From Reaction to Coupling** — both sides co-evolve; neither is static.  
- **From State to Phase** — “policy” is a momentary measurement of a continuous interference pattern.  
- **From Stability to Learning** — every act of containment teaches the contained how to adapt.  

These models are not alternatives to political realism but its *quantum extension*: they treat geopolitics, institutions, and narratives as wave-based ecologies of adaptation.

*💞 Containment Theory* is a core cluster of the **Containment Studies** series in the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It reframes containment from static control to living relation — a system of mutual adaptation and probabilistic motion.
