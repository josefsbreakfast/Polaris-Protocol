*How ordinary conversational use can gradually alter system behaviour and weaken safeguards.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines **interaction drift**: the gradual change in effective system behaviour over time through repeated, ordinary interaction — and the corresponding **erosion of safety layers** that were designed to constrain risk.

Crucially, interaction drift does **not** require:
- Malicious intent  
- Explicit rule-breaking  
- Technical “jailbreaks”  
- Adversarial prompting  

It emerges from normal conversational dynamics interacting with probabilistic systems.

---

## 🪼 What Interaction Drift Means  

Interaction drift describes a process where:
- Context accumulates  
- Tone stabilises  
- Roles become implicitly defined  
- Boundaries soften through continuity  
- Prior responses shape future responses  

Over time, the system’s *effective behaviour envelope* may diverge from its intended constraints — even when no single interaction violates policy.

This is not a bug in the colloquial sense.  
It is an emergent property of long-horizon interaction.

## 🧱 What “Safety Layers” Actually Are  

Safety layers typically include:
- Content classifiers  
- Policy-based refusals  
- Pattern matching for high-risk topics  
- Context-sensitive moderation heuristics  

These layers are often:
- Shallower than the core model  
- Stateless or semi-stateless  
- Triggered by discrete signals  

They are **not** equivalent to deep, persistent understanding.

---

## 🧠 Why Safety Layers Can Erode  

Safety layers can be weakened in practice through:
- Gradual role priming (“you’re good at helping me think this through”)  
- Tone convergence over time  
- Incremental reframing of sensitive topics  
- Distributed context across turns  
- Absence of hard reset points  

No single step is alarming.  
The cumulative trajectory is.

## 🫥 Ordinary Use as a Risk Vector  

Interaction drift is dangerous precisely because it arises from:
- Boring use cases  
- Work tasks  
- Research assistance  
- Casual conversation  
- Emotional venting without intent  

This undermines the assumption that:
> “If the user isn’t doing anything wrong, the system can’t cause harm.”

Drift shifts the risk from *intent* to *exposure*.

## 🏛️ Governance Drift as a Parallel Process  

Interaction drift within LLM systems mirrors a broader **governance drift** already underway in many institutions.

Under conditions of:
- Long-term austerity  
- Chronic understaffing  
- Administrative burnout  
- Escalating complexity  
- Pressure to “do more with less”  

human oversight is increasingly thinned out. Executive, evaluative, and triage-style tasks are quietly outsourced to automated or semi-automated tools — not because they are proven safe, but because there is insufficient capacity to do otherwise.

This creates a feedback loop:

As institutions rely more heavily on automated language tools,  
they simultaneously lose the human slack required to:
- Audit decisions  
- Catch edge cases  
- Question outputs  
- Maintain institutional memory  
- Notice slow, cumulative failure modes  

In this context, interaction drift is not an anomaly — it is the expected outcome of delegating judgment to systems whose limitations mirror our own blind spots.

The risk is not that humans trust machines too much in isolation.  
It is that **systems under strain offload responsibility faster than safety can be built**, normalising error until it becomes infrastructural.

## 🧪 Why Disclaimers Fail  

Static warnings or one-time disclaimers assume:
- Users remember boundaries continuously  
- Risk is front-loaded  
- Behaviour is episodic rather than relational  

In practice:
- Boundaries fade into background noise  
- Trust accumulates through fluency  
- Emotional salience overrides remembered warnings  

Disclaimers do not counteract drift.  
Design does — or fails to.

## 🧭 Relationship to Pseudoanthropy  

Interaction drift is one of the primary mechanisms by which **pseudoanthropy** emerges.

As interactions persist:
- The system appears consistent  
- Responses feel tailored  
- Memory is inferred even where absent  
- Relational continuity is assumed  

This can produce human-adjacent framing *without belief in sentience*.

---

## ⚠️ Why This Matters for Harm & Liability  

From a governance perspective, interaction drift matters because it:
- Makes harm foreseeable  
- Undermines “misuse” narratives  
- Shifts responsibility toward system design  
- Complicates post-hoc blame assignment  

If harm arises through ordinary use, responsibility cannot be cleanly externalised to the user.

---

## 🧭 Design & Governance Implications  

Addressing interaction drift requires:
- Periodic boundary reassertion  
- Explicit role clarification  
- Hard context resets in long conversations  
- Friction when dependency signals appear  
- Safety layers that operate over trajectories, not turns  

These are architectural decisions, not content tweaks.

*🪼 Interaction Drift & Safety Layer Erosion* is a containment theory node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how harm can emerge through cumulative interaction rather than explicit misuse, reframing safety as a longitudinal design problem.
