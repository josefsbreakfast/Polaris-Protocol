# 🪞 Containment & Détente as Temporal Governance  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Control of rate and scope rather than binary state.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Containment and détente are not moral opposites but **temporal instruments**.  
They manage *speed* and *scope* — the tempo of change and the range of permitted relation.  
When viewed as temporal governance, containment slows, filters, and sequences; détente widens and synchronises.  

---

## 🧩 Core Principles  

- **Rate Control:** regulating how quickly novelty can enter a system.  
- **Scope Control:** determining how far interactions can extend without collapse.  
- **Temporal Asymmetry:** power lies in controlling others’ clocks — their reaction time, refresh cycles, and update velocity.  
- **Phase Windows:** moments of détente are scheduled relief intervals that maintain system survivability.

## 🕰️ Implication  
Temporal governance converts energy into order.  
When external dynamics exceed the system’s time constants, governance fails — not from lack of will, but from **temporal mismatch**.

*🪞 Containment & Détente as Temporal Governance* is a living node of the **💞 Containment Theory** cluster.  
It reframes strategy as time modulation, revealing how control operates through tempo rather than territory.
