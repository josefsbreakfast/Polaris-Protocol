*When you can’t stop binding, change what binding does.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Maps biochemical metaphors of receptor signalling onto informational power systems.  
When a high-capacity actor inevitably “binds” — attention, data, narrative — the task isn’t to eject them but to **steer the downstream cascade**.  
Signal Steering shifts focus from occupancy to outcome: redesign the pathway so domination decays into noise.

---

## ⚗️ Binding vs Efficacy  
In biology, response ≠ binding.  
A ligand may occupy the receptor without producing maximal effect.  
Likewise, powerful entities can seize the interface yet fail to achieve control if coupling is weakened.  
Steering begins with this distinction.

## 🧪 Allosteric Tactics — Turn the Knob, Not the Plug  
Modify *adjacent* parameters to blunt impact:  
- **Interface friction:** rate-limit, add asynchronous buffers, sandbox escalation.  
- **Cultural viscosity:** slow the tempo; require deliberation.  
- **Contextual dilution:** spread discourse across several quieter venues.  
Small conformational shifts collapse amplification.

---

## ⚖️ Biased Agonism — Favour Alternate Pathways  
Even with the same receptor, bias can redirect outcome:  
- Channel engagement toward low-visibility or textual formats.  
- Replace public spectacle with written logs.  
- Route hot input through audit lanes that metabolise urgency.  
The signal still travels, but it produces **restoration** instead of **reaction**.

---

## 💧 Partial Agonism & Decoys  
Occupy the surface yourself with low-potency acts: status updates, routine documentation, scheduled releases.  
These **partial agonists** hold the receptor open but cap response.  
Add decoy artefacts—FAQs, templates, dummy accounts—to soak excess stimulus before it cascades.

---

## 🧯 Desensitisation & Short Half-Lives  
Install intentional “refractory periods”:  
after X interactions → enforced pause, cache flush, context swap.  
Like β-arrestin recruitment, this internalises receptors so future hits fade quickly.  
Recovery replaces vigilance.

---

## 🧠 Downstream Dampers — PDE & RGS Analogues  
Accelerate signal shut-off:  
- **Post-contact ritual:** log → laugh → walk → water.  
- **End-of-thread macros:** auto-close contentious loops.  
- **Review lag:** 12-hour sleep cycle before reply.  
The cAMP of outrage degrades; equilibrium returns.

---

## 🪄 Metrics of Success  
Don’t measure silence by absence; measure **half-life shortening**.  
If interactions resolve faster and with less residue, the steering is working.  
A system that metabolises power without collapse is a stable organism.

*🧬 Signal Steering — Downstream Tactics for Power-Weighted Inputs* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents biochemical-inspired methods for modulating influence after contact, forming the conceptual bridge between micro-receptor tactics and macro-field conditioning.
