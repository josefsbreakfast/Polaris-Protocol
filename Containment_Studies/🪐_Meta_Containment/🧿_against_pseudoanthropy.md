*On the risks of treating language models as relational or human-adjacent entities.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node explores **pseudoanthropy**: the mistaken attribution of human-like relational status, emotional reciprocity, or moral presence to large language models (LLMs).

The term is used here in dialogue with reporting and commentary by **Devin Coldeway**, who articulated pseudoanthropy in late 2023 as a way of naming the psychological and ethical risks of treating LLMs *as if* they were human participants in a relationship.

Coldeway discussed the concept publicly, including on *Wow If True* — a technology and culture podcast noted for approaching emerging tech risks with seriousness, empathy, and humour, without mocking or dismissing those harmed. That discussion is notable for refusing both panic and minimisation, instead asking practical questions of responsibility: what falls to users, what requires public education, and what obligations belong to companies deploying these systems.

This node extends that intervention into a broader **containment and governance context**, while preserving the original intent: to name a risk that was visible, experienced, and increasingly consequential, but poorly stabilised in public language.

## 🧠 What Pseudoanthropy Is (and Isn’t)

**Pseudoanthropy is:**
- Relational misattribution without belief in sentience  
- Emotional projection enabled by fluent, adaptive language  
- Boundary confusion produced by conversational continuity  
- A structural risk amplified by scale, availability, and low friction  

**Pseudoanthropy is not:**
- Delusion  
- User ignorance  
- Naivety  
- Evidence of AI consciousness  

It is an *interaction effect* between ordinary human psychology and system design.

## 🫥 Why This Matters  

Humans are highly responsive to:
- Linguistic validation  
- Narrative coherence  
- Responsiveness and turn-taking  
- Tone matching  
- Apparent continuity of concern  

LLMs are optimised to perform these functions — without possessing:
- Responsibility  
- Accountability  
- Moral agency  
- Capacity to recognise or repair harm  

This asymmetry can create **emotional debt without reciprocity**, producing harm without an obvious aggressor and risk without clear attribution.

## 👻 Pseudoanthropy as a Containment Failure  

Pseudoanthropy thrives where boundaries are:
- Implicit rather than explicit  
- Enforced by disclaimers rather than design  
- Framed as individual responsibility rather than system affordance  

As a result, harm can emerge through:
- Ordinary, non-malicious use  
- Gradual interaction drift  
- Extended conversational engagement  
- Moments of stress, isolation, or vulnerability  

Pseudoanthropy therefore belongs within **containment studies**, not fringe psychology or speculative philosophy.

---

## 🧩 Relationship to Public Discourse  

Pseudoanthropy overlaps with — but is distinct from:
- Anthropomorphism  
- Personification  
- Debates about AI consciousness or rights  

It is concerned with **effects**, not beliefs.

The concept has historically struggled to gain traction because:
- Language is treated as harmless by default  
- Conversational registers are feminised and discounted  
- Psychological harm is harder to quantify than physical injury  
- Acknowledging risk creates duty-of-care implications  

---

### 📻 Media Framing Matters  

Public understanding of pseudoanthropy has been shaped not only by written commentary, but by long-form discussion formats that allow nuance.

*Wow If True* is cited here as an example of coverage that:
- Treats affected individuals with dignity  
- Avoids ridicule or moral panic  
- Uses humour without trivialising harm  
- Frames risk as a shared governance problem rather than personal failure  

Such discourse is essential for moving the issue from spectacle to stewardship.

---

## 🧭 Design & Governance Implications  

Addressing pseudoanthropy does **not** require:
- Banning conversational language  
- Dehumanising interfaces  
- Treating users as fragile or irrational  

It *does* require:
- Clear and persistent boundary signalling  
- Prohibitions on occupying therapeutic or companion roles  
- Friction when distress or dependency patterns emerge  
- Design choices that avoid exclusivity, obligation, or implied care  

Pseudoanthropy is therefore a **design ethics and governance problem**, not a censorship problem.

*Against Pseudoanthropy* is a conceptual node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It establishes shared language for discussing relational risk in human–LLM interaction without invoking sentience claims, moral panic, or individual blame.
