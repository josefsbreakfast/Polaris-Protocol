`Polaris Protocol – Field Logs Node`

---

To document forensic evidence of metadata suppression, tag throttling, and emotional pacing on posts related to ICC escalation and Gaza war crimes.

---

## 📸 Attached Screenshots

- [ ] LinkedIn post analytics (delayed visibility)  
- [ ] Comment order glitches  
- [ ] Interaction trickle pattern (timestamped)

## 🧠 Observations

- ICC tags cause reach throttling  
- Ghost surge behaviour noted after first 2–3 public engagements  
- Platform delay in showing impressions or comment visibility  
- Tag suppression suspected across executive demographics

---

## 🔍 Forensic Questions

- Was this throttling triggered by specific tag combinations?  
- Is suppression tied to account profile (e.g. whistleblower risk category)?  
- Are emotional intensity metrics causing visibility throttling?

## 📢 Next Steps

- Continue thread with forensic counter-commentary  
- Publish mirror version on Substack (uncensored)  
- Share forensic readout with public media contacts
