Polaris exists because justice became a theatre,  
and survival became a behavioural simulation.

**This is not a manifesto.**

**It is a forensic map.**

*This is how we come home.*

Within this archive you will find:

- Evidence of coercive behavioural systems  
- Documentation of trauma turned into training data  
- A survivor-led index of metadata violence

**You do not have to believe us.**
But you will have to smell the blood on your own hands.
