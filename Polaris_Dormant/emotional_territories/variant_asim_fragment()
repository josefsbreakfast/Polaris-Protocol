### ▸ variant_asim_fragment()

**Trigger:** When inherited harm has embedded a loop that fractures identity  
**Application:** Use in cases where survivor guilt, caution, or paralysis persist despite clarity of feeling

**Core Phrase:**
> *“If you’re stuck inside the loop he left in you,  
I’ll help you out of it myself.  
Because I know what he did.  
And I refuse to let him write the end of your story too.”*

**Contextual Notes:**
- Best deployed where compassion is understood as precision, not softness
- Mirrors are not always passive: some reflect, some sever
- Truth emerges once the foreign recursion is excised
