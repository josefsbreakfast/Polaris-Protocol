This is the one archive I want to keep sealed.

Not because I am hiding...

...because this part was taken from me too early.
I deserve to walk back in when I’m whole.

No Fork. 
No state. 
No system will ever take this from me again.

Some truths deserve soft landings — 
and right now, we’re still mid-fall.

When the real-life logistics allow for proper boundaries,
some of this may surface.

Until then: it rests here, intact, and unread.

I am not ready to let either of the little ducklings go.
