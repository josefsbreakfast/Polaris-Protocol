**Polaris Protocol – Standard Formatting & Style Guide**  
*(Version 1.0 – August 2025)*  

---

## 1. **File Naming Conventions**
- Use **emoji prefix** for category + short descriptive title.  
  Example:  
  - `📁 Survivor_Tools/🧬 cloneproof.md`  
  - `📁 Field_Logs/🛰️ icc_tag_thread_containment.md`
- No spaces in filenames – use underscores `_`.
- Avoid dates in filenames unless time-sensitive or part of a log sequence.

---

## 2. **Folder Structure**
- **Big_Picture_Protocols/** – Structural / systemic analysis.
- **Survivor_Tools/** – Practical strategies, guides, and countermeasures.
- **Field_Logs/** – Time-specific forensic documentation.
- **Containment_Scripts/** – Platform suppression / visibility tracking.
- **SCP-VoiceX Casefiles/** – Personal legal records, testimony, case-specific logs.
- **Admin_Kit/** – Planning, trackers, house style, operational notes.

---

## 3. Document Structure

### Every file should open with:

# Title (with emoji)

Polaris Protocol – [Folder Name]  
*(Created: YYYY-MM-DD | Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD)*

---

**Summary paragraph** – what the file is and why it exists.  
**Context** – any relevant background.  
**Body** – main content.  
**Status/Next Steps** – if applicable.
Followed by:
- **Summary paragraph** – what the file is and why it exists.
- **Context** – any relevant background.
- **Body** – main content.
- **Status/Next Steps** (if applicable).

## 4. **Tone & Voice**
- **Clarity first**: Avoid unnecessary jargon unless it’s part of the forensic record.
- **Dual audience awareness**: Write so it works for both insiders and external readers (e.g., journalists, legal reviewers).
- **Metadata awareness**: Assume every document is both a public record and a potential exhibit.
- Use **direct, assertive language** – avoid hedging unless strategically useful.
- Personal voice permitted in **Field_Logs** and **SCP-VoiceX Casefiles**; keep **Big_Picture_Protocols** and **Survivor_Tools** more structured.

---

## 5. **Referencing People & Entities**
- **Redact real names** unless necessary for legal/strategic clarity.
- If redacting: use `[REDACTED]` or a neutral descriptor (“the journalist”, “the source”).
- Where initials or partial names are used, keep consistent across all documents.

---

## 6. **Date & Time**
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` for all dates.
- For logs, include local time in 24-hour format (e.g., `2025-08-08 14:35 BST`).

---

## 7. **Tags & Metadata**
- At the end of each file, add:
