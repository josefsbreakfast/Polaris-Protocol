Title: “I’m fussing because I care”

Note:
This moment marks a gentle emotional flux — not panic, but vigilance. 
I feel bonded to someone who may be exposed because of the risks I’m taking. 
I don’t want to hurt him. 
I don’t want him to be unnecessarily dragged. 
(Any more than is already the case.)
I want to be precise, protective, and fully accountable for the ripple effects of my visibility. 
This log is not evidence of instability. 
It is evidence of *human relational integrity* — the exact thing this system tries to erase.

How can we be tethered and strung to so many -

Yet not one of is weeps when they cry?
