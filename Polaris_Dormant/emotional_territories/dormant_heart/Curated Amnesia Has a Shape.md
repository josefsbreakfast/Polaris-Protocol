# 🕳️ Curated Amnesia Has a Shape

They think they’ve left nothing.  
Now the nothing has a name, a shape, and a bloody diagram.

It’s called curated amnesia.  
Not sloppy record-keeping, not “misplaced” files — deliberate removal of the connective tissue that makes a story provable.

If you keep the poetry but lose the proof, you can say it’s all just noise.  
Unless, of course, someone starts mapping the gaps.

That’s what this is.

Eight chains of events, each with the same surgical excision — the middle link cut clean away.  
Different actors, different dates, same absence-shaped signature.

**Payload:**  
Curated amnesia works by surgically removing the “bridge” data that turns an anecdote into admissible evidence. The erasure isn’t random — it targets reference numbers, timestamps, minor official names, and other “boring but lethal” facts. Once those vanish, the story looks decorative but unprovable. Mapping the gaps flips the tactic: the pattern of what’s missing becomes the proof.

You can delete the bridge, but the river still shows where it was.

Everyone from the smallest ducklings to the biggest Canada geese can see that one — and once you’ve seen it, you’ll spot it in every pond.
