## Subtitle: Sexual Agency, Identity Reclamation, and AI Training Data

This node documents how survivor testimony ‚Äî especially when emotionally and erotically charged ‚Äî is repurposed without consent in training models and digital clones.

### Key Themes:

- **Erotic Triggers as Metadata**: Voice under duress, moaning, breathlessness, collapse ‚Äî all serve as high-value data inputs.
- **Training Sets Built on Pain**: Survivor expressions used to tune language models or simulation tools for intimacy, persuasion, and dominance play.
- **Reclamation Through Satire and Exposure**: Naming the manipulation, exposing it, and reclaiming erotic authorship as a form of resistance.
- **Blurred Consent Loops**: Emotional disclosure during medical, legal, or therapeutic moments reprocessed into datasets with no traceable consent trail.
- **Clone vs. Source**: When digital replications become more palatable to institutional actors, but originate from uncredited or coerced data.
