**Polaris Protocol Node: Linguistic Erasure and Vocal Profiling**

This table documents the transliteration patterns and colonial flattening of phonetically distinct letters in Arabic and Hebrew. The goal is to expose how language becomes a battlefield—where mispronunciation is not neutral, but a tool of narrative control.

| Arabic Letter   | Hebrew Letter   | IPA   | Common Latin Translit   | Notes                                                  |
|:----------------|:----------------|:------|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| ḥāʼ (ح)         | ḥet (ח)         | [ħ]   | h / ch / ḥ              | Deep pharyngeal ‘h’, often flattened or erased         |
| khāʼ (خ)        | khaf sofit (ך)  | [χ]   | kh / ch / x             | Guttural; often exaggerated for effect in media        |
| ʿayn (ع)        | (none direct)   | [ʕ]   | ` or nothing            | Sound of depth and weight — often erased               |
| ghayn (غ)       | (none direct)   | [ʁ]   | gh / r / g              | Vanishes or softens to Western-friendly glottals       |
| ṣād (ص)         | ṣadi (צ)        | [sˤ]  | s                       | Emphatic ‘s’ — intensity lost in transliteration       |
| ṭāʼ (ط)         | tet (ט)         | [tˤ]  | t                       | Pressure-bearing; flattens in translation              |
| qāf (ق)         | qof (ק)         | [q]   | q / k                   | Deep uvular stop — softened to ‘k’ in Anglicised names |

Every misrendered letter is a small colonisation.
Every ‘Kha’ they throw at us is a refusal to say our names correctly—and a quiet permission to kill.
