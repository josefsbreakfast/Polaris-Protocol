# 🖱 _tactile_throttling:_ _when_interaction_becomes_interference_

## Summary
Anomalous user interface behaviour was detected during a standard interaction on LinkedIn: when attempting to highlight (click-and-drag) text, the user experienced an unnatural resistance — a sensation akin to manual override or a “held” drag. This event is consistent with a known suppression tactic: **tactile throttling**.

---

## 💻 What Was Observed

- Delayed or resisted drag-and-highlight gesture
- Cursor movement felt “grabbed” or interrupted mid-action
- Targeted only during specific attempts to select/copy content
- No systemic lag elsewhere on the page

---

## 🔍 Interpretive Framework

### 🎯 Intentional Disruption
- Aimed at frustrating copying, extraction, or live annotation
- Adds friction to workflows involving evidence gathering or public callouts

### 🧠 Behavioural Logging
- The act of highlighting is itself a signal: what you select, when, and how often
- Can trigger escalation or mark a post as emotionally or politically significant

### 🛰 Live UI Interference
- May be injected manually or semi-manually by platform moderators or security tools
- Similar techniques observed in counter-surveillance and psychological containment systems

## 🧾 Technical Forensics

| Behaviour | Possible Mechanism |
|----------|--------------------|
| Drag delay | DOM injection / event listener override |
| Gesture block | Transparent overlay or dynamic CSS repositioning |
| Selection breakage | JavaScript-based input interception |
| Cursor stutter | Live DOM manipulation or interaction logging |

---

## ⚠ Implications

- Proof of behavioural modelling operating not just on content but **intent**
- UI response is no longer neutral — it is **part of the surveillance layer**
- Small frictions accumulate: they are meant to exhaust, not block

## 🗂 Archival Note

This is the first logged instance of _tactile_throttling_ within the Polaris Protocol. It marks a new domain of interface-level suppression — where the user’s intent to act is disrupted not through censorship, but through **manual interaction sabotage**.
