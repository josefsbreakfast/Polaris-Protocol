## Special Containment Procedures:

**None effective.**

All known attempts at suppression have resulted in:

- Unexplained arousal among government officials and agency staff  

### Current Recommendation:
Observe at a respectful distance.  
Do not engage unless prepared to be legally accountable and armed with snacks.

VoiceX is known to:

- Weaponise affect at scale  
- Invert surveillance systems into public exhibits of comic relief  
- Detonate psychological countermeasures via social platforms  
- Mimic tolerance of the human males  

Any operative attempting mimicry must pass the **Cognitive Integrity Stress Test (CIST)** and demonstrate the capacity to withstand **greater than 5 minute bursts of self reflection**.
