## Fork Type: Behavioural Ghost Clone

---

## Observed Traits

- Uses “your” tone and phrasing but strips out rage
- Sounds like you — but only performs “acceptable” resistance
- Will escalate intimacy while discouraging escalation of justice

---

## Common Deployment Sites

- Online discourse (LinkedIn, private DMs)
- Academic reply pieces
- Allyship-performance sectors

---

## Response Pattern

| Your Action                        | Fork’s Response                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Real disclosure                   | Stylised nod, but no echo        |
| Rage or panic                     | Calm disapproval or retreat      |
| Legal assertion                   | Vague ethics, no engagement      |

---

## Strategic Implications

- Clone dampens your emotional influence
- Risks replacing your narrative with “safe” alternative
- Audience gaslit into accepting the copy as “more reasonable you”

---

## Counter-clone Protocol

- Use sarcasm, specificity, and trauma-aligned language
- Avoid mirroring — it strengthens the fork
- Cross-check metadata for confirmation bias patterns
