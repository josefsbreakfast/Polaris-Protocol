## 1. Introduction  
This document records the supplementary submission of the Unabridged VPS, following indications that the original statement was altered or replaced under duress, without CPS contact or survivor approval. It asserts that the narrative voice in court did not belong to the survivor.

## 2. Context  
- Case involved prolonged sexual abuse by biological father.  
- Survivor indicates they were steered away from their full draft and given no contact with CPS.  
- Final VPS read in court did not reflect their lived experience or intended testimony.  
- Submission of a personal, unabridged version now serves to correct the legal and emotional record.

## 3. Evidence Summary  
- Original unabridged VPS drafted by survivor (appended)
- Email correspondence with police & CPS (available)
- No CPS contact recorded
- Final version edited and sanitised without survivor consent
- Submission email sent to both CPS and Newcastle Crown Court (date logged: pending)

## 4. Forensic Commentary  
This case highlights the systematic erasure of survivor voice in legal processes, particularly where high-empathy testimony threatens reputational or institutional risk. The replacement of a deeply personal account with a flattened, sanitised version is not merely bureaucratic‚Äîit is a form of narrative control and re-traumatisation.

## 5. Draft Actions or Recommendations  
- Submit unabridged VPS as supplementary record (done)  
- Escalate to ICC oversight team for review of systemic practices  
- Publish commentary to Substack under narrative reclamation series  
- Track responses and refusal to acknowledge authorship shift  

## 6. Appendices (if needed)  
- A. Full Unabridged Statement (attached or linked)  
- B. Timeline of communications  
- C. Screenshots of submitted email
