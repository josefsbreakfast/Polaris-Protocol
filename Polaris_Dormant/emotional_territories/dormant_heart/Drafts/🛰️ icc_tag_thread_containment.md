## 🔍 Summary

This log documents real-time throttling, engagement suppression, and interface disruption on a public LinkedIn thread referencing ICC/ICJ jurisdiction, metadata misuse, whistleblower testimony, and UK state complicity. The post was published under the VoiceX persona as part of an ongoing Polaris Protocol visibility breach campaign.

| `ZbcL...` | 1 public comment triggers no demographic unlock (unusual) |
| `WbnGB...` | Metrics frozen despite known external views |

## 🧠 Observed Containment Behaviour

- **Delayed Impressions:**  
  Initial impressions failed to register despite confirmed public visibility and external viewing. This diverges from typical LinkedIn behaviour where a single view triggers metric changes.

- **Throttling Patterns:**  
  Likely backend throttling applied to suppress tag reach and limit viral spread. Tags included high-risk visibility triggers:
  - `#ICC`
  - `#MetadataForensics`
  - `#WhistleblowerProtection`
  - `#GazaGenocide`
  - `#BritishComplicity`

- **Comment-Based Visibility Lock:**  
  Historically, 1–2 comments on a post would unlock demographic insights (company size, role seniority). This behaviour now appears patched or forcibly disabled on Polaris-tagged content.

- **Image Rendering Failures:**  
  Some viewers reported issues loading attached images (screenshots of ICC filings, Substack metadata). Potential manual interference or CDN manipulation.

## 🧬 Forensic Indicators

- **Clone Bait Suppression:**  
  Thread features behavioural bait language and high-impact phrases likely to trigger containment models trained on forked emotional patterns.

- **NDA/FOIA Crosslink Suppression:**  
  Post references active GitHub and MoJ escalations; suppression likely tied to institutional discomfort with ongoing forensic documentation.

- **Jurisdictional Flare Triggers:**  
  ICC/ICJ jurisdiction tags are known to escalate content into monitored queues. Pattern suggests state–platform coordination to limit reach.

## 🧱 Impact Assessment

| Element | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Engagement Metrics | Frozen | Views not aligning with public interactions |
| External Shareability | Moderate | Substack links intact, GitHub suspended |
| Legal Visibility | At Risk | ICC references obscured by throttling |
| Clone Differentiation | Active | Thread designed to differentiate human from mimic based on reaction patterns |

## 🛠️ Countermeasures

- **Mirror to Substack & GitHub (alt)**  
- **PDF archival and SCP node creation**  
- **Re-tag content using alternate phrasing to bypass throttle**  
- **Backlink from other platforms to force API registration**  
- **Use demographic-agnostic hooks for executive visibility**
