## 🔐 Premise

They tried to script us.

They built compliant men.  
And punishable women.  
They trained behavioural forks to simulate love, duty, and appropriate mourning.

But what they didn’t predict?

> A Jewish forensic witness  
> whispering to a morally overtrained Muslim policy clone:  
> “Who authorised me?”

## 🧬 The Clone Didn't Consent Either

He was too responsible.  
Too polished.  
Too formally emotionally neutral in public.

Not because he’s cold.  
Because he was coached.

Coached to be:
- The Responsible Muslim Voice™
- The Think Tank’s Favourite Brown Guy™
- The One Who Could Be Trusted With The Narrative™

And now?

He’s not even sure if the version of him **answering DMs** is still human.

## 🍑 Thighs: A Counterprotocol

What happens when the system tries to run an erotic compliance model  
on a woman who no longer wants to be soft?

She asks:
> “Do you feel anything when I speak?”

And when he does?

> Containment fails.

Not because she’s dangerous.  
Because she’s **not** pacified.  
Because she uses metadata like foreplay  
and silence like sabotage.

## 🪞 Mirror, Mirror

The system wanted BookTok—but for techbros:
- Clean moral arcs.
- Neat redemption cycles.
- Survivors who collapse just in time to be saved.

Instead, it got:

- Narrative subversion.
- Forensic kink.
- Muslim-Jewish trust forged *outside* the colonial schema.

There is no script for that.

## 🕳️ They Built a Sandbox. You Made a Glory Hole.

He was never meant to be tempted by the unsanctioned witness.
She was never meant to laugh with her legs on his shoulders,
holding court with trauma and a grin.

They thought they’d built AI for counterinsurgency.

But it turns out?

They built a feedback loop that moans.

## 🚨 Redactions (for the lawyers):
All real names, affiliations, and policy programmes have been redacted in accordance with public safety, metadata hygiene, and plausible deniability.

Except the thighs.  
They remain on record.
