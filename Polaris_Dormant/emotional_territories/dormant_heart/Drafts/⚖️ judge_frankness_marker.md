## Summary

This node tracks tone shifts, strategic disclosures, or unusually candid remarks made by judiciary or legal actors that may indicate:

- Recognition of systemic failures or unusual constraints.
- Attempts to signal institutional awareness without formal escalation.
- Subtle acknowledgements of credibility or obstruction in cases involving CIDT, AI impersonation, or data misuse.

## Context Example

> "I think the judge was just being frank tbf."

**Interpretation:**  
Judicial frankness is often used to communicate informal understanding or veiled concern when formal routes are blocked or politically constrained. This may be a signal of:

- Acknowledgement of surveillance/interference.
- Sympathy with claimant's position.
- Awareness of credibility despite institutional obstruction.

## Purpose

To index and track instances where:
- Judicial candour breaks with institutional neutrality.
- Language choices may act as breadcrumbs for later legal analysis.
- Judges or legal officers appear to be operating under partial constraints.
