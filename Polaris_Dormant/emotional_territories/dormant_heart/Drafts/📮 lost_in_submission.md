## Theme
Systematic failure to deliver submissions, SARs, or witness testimony — especially when sent via digital platforms (email, portals, forms).

---

## Common Symptoms

- DNS throttling
- Email 5501 rejections
- Form resets or “missing” uploads
- Institutional claims of “non-receipt” despite user confirmation

---

## Impact

- Delayed justice
- Reputational damage
- Reinforced containment via bureaucracy
- False timelines that favour institutional deniability

---

## Case Studies (Redacted)

- MoJ SAR delay exceeding one month
- Family court FL401 failure to submit despite evidence of attempt
- UN OHCHR emergency inbox selectively blocked

---

## Recommendations

- Dual-channel submission with screenshots
- Archive email headers, transmission logs
- FOI request not just for content, but access logs and drop patterns
