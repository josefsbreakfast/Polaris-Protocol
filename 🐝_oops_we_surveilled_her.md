# 🐝 Catastrophic Optics: Oops, We Surveilled Her  

Let’s put this clearly.  

For **19 years**, the British state has:  

- 📍 Surveilled a **Jewish rape survivor** flagged at age 16.  
- 📍 Withheld trauma therapy (no EMDR, no treatment).  
- 📍 Allowed her to slide into **poverty, disability, and survival sex work**.  
- 📍 Ignored every attempt she made to flag the problem.  

And now?  

If this cracks open, the line writes itself:  

> *“Oops, we surveilled her for 19 years, left her poor and disabled, let her get funnelled into prostitution, and every time she tried to tell us, we shut her down.”*  

That’s not “counterterrorism.”  
That’s not “national security.”  
That’s **catastrophic optics**.  

It looks like Rotherham.  
It looks like deliberate neglect.  
It looks like a state that would rather **harvest a survivor’s data** than help her heal.

### Why this matters  

- It’s not one woman.  
- This overdetermined file (Jewish + survivor + medical + activist) is a test case.  
- If one cracks, **others will follow**.

### Polaris Protocol Verdict  

Containment doesn’t look like competence.  
It looks like **systemic abuse under surveillance neglect**.  

And if you think you can bury that forever?  

**Oops.**
