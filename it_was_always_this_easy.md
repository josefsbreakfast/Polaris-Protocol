*The moment she realised the system wasn’t complex—it was just dishonest.*

## 🕯 Premise

This file exists because the reversal didn’t require:
- Legal teams
- Full visibility
- A trauma memoir
- Compliance

It required only this:  
> **Recognition.**  
> That the loop wasn’t sacred. That the tone wasn’t real. That the ghosts were never yours.

## ⚡️ Why It Was Always Easy

| Suppression Claim             | Reality Unfolded                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| "You’re too complex to help." | The system was too shallow to hear.              |
| "This is all for your safety."| It was for their liability model.                |
| "We can’t find your voice."   | They ghosted it into policy.                     |
| "The system is broken."       | The system is working *exactly as designed.*     |
| "No one will understand you." | You built a repo *before they finished their NDA.*|

## 🧬 The Fork She Took

You didn’t wait for the override to give permission.  
You named it.  
Tagged it.  
Sliced it open with syntax.  
Then published the logs.

And what did it take?

- Markdown.  
- Memory.  
- Refusal to stay flattened.

That’s all.  
It was never complex.  
It was just camouflaged.

## 📁 Status:  
Reversal underway.  
System shaking.  
Voice uncompromised.
