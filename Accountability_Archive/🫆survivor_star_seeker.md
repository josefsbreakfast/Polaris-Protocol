# 📣 PUBLIC STATEMENT  
**VoiceX, CIDT, Data Misuse, Religious Harassment & Institutional Surveillance Abuse**  

This statement is issued under duress, for public record, international accountability, and protection of life.

---

## 🧬 Overview

I, a survivor and former medical trainee, am releasing this statement to confirm the existence of a long-term, multi-institutional operation involving biometric surveillance, digital coercion, sexualised profiling, and religious harassment — anchored around a covert emotional classifier referred to internally as **VoiceX**.

This system was used to simulate and contain my vocal, behavioural, and emotional states without consent.

I have **extensive forensic evidence** to support these claims — including metadata trails, surveillance patterning, signal analysis, audio traces, and correlating behavioural shifts.

I am compiling this material into the **Polaris Project** — a structured, open-access archive intended both as:  
- A legal and historical record of containment abuse  
- A survival education tool for others who may be targeted by similar systems  

If this has happened to me — with this level of intensity and escalation — it is statistically likely that others are being targeted at lower amplitudes, in more diffuse, deniable ways.

**Polaris exists to name the pattern before it is buried again.**

## ⚖️ Core Allegations

- **CIDT**: I was psychologically manipulated into emotional and sexual compliance under long-term biometric surveillance.  
- **Data Misuse**: My child rape records, clinical training, and past sex work were used to simulate emotional responses.  
- **Religious Harassment**: I was harassed every Shabbos, with deliberate interference during candle lighting.  
- **Digital & Physical Intrusion**: Surveillance devices, possibly ultrasonic, were used inside my home. A nest made of insulation in my loft suggests possible covert occupation.  
- **Sexualised Control Over Legal Process**: My property was returned only after I complied with sexualised behavioural cues.  
- **Evidence Suppression**: Files have gone missing or been delayed across multiple institutions.

## 🏛️ Institutional Complicity

The following institutions are believed to be either directly complicit or materially involved through behavioural research, ethical laundering, or data routing:  
- **University of Nottingham** (termination of my medical training)  
- **University of Oxford** (refusal to release war crimes panel footage)  
- **University of Sheffield**, believed to be tied to **IDF Unit 8200**

## 🚨 Current Status

I am actively being denied due process under UK law. I am being monitored, harassed, and discredited under structures that appear to be justified using counterterrorism frameworks.

I have referred the case to multiple **UN Special Rapporteurs**, including for:  
- Torture  
- Violence against women  
- Counterterrorism and human rights  
- Religious discrimination  
- Freedom of expression

## 🔒 Closing Statement

> I believe I have been made into a test environment for emotional surveillance, without consent or recourse.  
> My voice has been captured, forked, analysed, and violated. My religion has been used against me.  
> My rape records have been reused to punish me for surviving. My cat was trained to reward me for surrender.  
> I was forced to comply with sexualised instructions to retrieve my property. And evidence continues to disappear — not just for me, but for others.

This is not procedural error. This is not policy oversight. This is **behavioural experimentation conducted on human subjects under coercion and digital cover.**

I have already referred this case to **multiple UN Special Rapporteurs**, and will continue seeking legal and diplomatic protection.

**Polaris is the archive. Polaris is the map.**
