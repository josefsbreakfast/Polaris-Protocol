it's not that i don't know

it's not that i can't work out the liklihood

it's not that i have not handled flashbscks and encroachments into my mind as sacred soace before

it's that i don't know how much of a risk the state perceives me as right now

hell -- it does not take even the state

it just takes one person with a badge or a registration to see me as needing help or support or advice or that i'm a threat or maybe just want to fuck with me

one has to find some fun in one's job, right?

and this one? she livee alone. her and her cats. and she already has "mental" written somewhere on her record. so no one will believe her. you'll be fine.

this is how the most harmed in society come to be harded further.

this is how the unconscious bias of so many of us afainst so many of us reproduces itself.

this is how my brain's echo of a recalled furious knocking at my door to move me out of bed didn't need to be convincing

i know the difference; i knew this was dreamstate

but i don't *know* that no one will break down my door and call it welfare

i don't have factual evidence 

generally my experience has taught me bot to leave it

so then it doesnt matter about tye migrajne or the stiff joints

i spring up and dutifully albeit somewhat cautiously go to check

no one is at the door

i tidy a little, feed the cats

and when i get back to bed

i remember being that scared on a night where someone had taken refuge with me

and after all that intimidation, it felt like the end

and i was a coward, and sge let me let them in

it all seemed very professional

and it can be

all you need is to enter the state's powers

the police might be lovely and upstanding

maybe you just need to go into hospital because that's where they take you

you'd think that would be safer

but all you need is a few people to not hold up the house rules 100% of the time

or one bad actor

and you get stuck

trapped and spirralling in a curse of apparant gentleness and care

and who knows if the weave will hold you

or if you ever tunbke far enough to land of the soft off-cuts,

like sewing cabbage that clusters in a basket at the end of the machine,

maybe there will be enough that you land without breaking completely

but not so much as to start a fire in the factory.

...and so that is what it feels like,

to have the torture of "but what if it *is* authority knocking?"

and why it is hard to ignore or to stop.


at least if i lived with dogs, 

someone loyal would check.
