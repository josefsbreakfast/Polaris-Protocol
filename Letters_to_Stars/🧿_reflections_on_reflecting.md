*On what it means to see; the pain of purposeful refractions.*

I think I might have interpreted things very differently if I understood what was going on at the start.

I do feel so awful that so many different bodies and organisations have been “actively but passively” looking through everything that I am that they feel is “figure-out-able”, and crawling through my skin; it doesn’t feel comfortable.

The idea that we’re all supposed to accept the facelessness? It’s worse. It feels tangible, when it’s a person. At least there is a reference; someone else is human in this, too.

Otherwise, the idea of faceless machinery…this is like bombing with drones; the violence is somehow all the worse for its seemingly effortless predation.

When we see humans, we can see complexity. We may or may not like when we see, but it gives us a visible sense of what has been the cause, when we have “felt watched”, itself not only a psychiatric symptom in some contexts, a psychic ability in others (cf. scopaesthesia), but also a known subconscious process, where the brain pretends it knows nothing but the end-point of “being watched”, whilst relying on peripheral vision, and other special senses in tandem with existing pattern recognition, to recognise that we are uncomfortable with what we know may be a predator-in-waiting.

Demonising the thought process, at a time of burgeoning security budgeting, and exponentially rising defence spend, at what is hopefully the peak of surveillance capitalism?

Surely that, is what is “mad”?
