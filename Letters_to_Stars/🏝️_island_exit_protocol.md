## Preamble  

When the world insists you are in a perpetual interview —  
when every word is tested, every move scrutinised, every silence recorded —  
the truest refusal is not another audition, but an **exit protocol**.  

This is the island.  
Not metaphorical retreat, but sovereign claim.

## The Island Animals  

- **Cows** → grounding, patience, sustenance.  
- **Goats** → resilience, mischief, agility on rough terrain.  
- **Alpaca** → softness, watchfulness, community fibre.  
- **Llama** → the sentinel; carries burdens but spits when threatened.  

Each animal is a facet of survival: slow strength, nimble refusal, soft endurance, sharp defence.

## The Perimeter  

The island is not hidden.  
It is visible enough that others know it exists.  
But its **perimeter is absolute**:  
- Approach as guest, or  
- Be told, simply: **fuck off.**  

This clarity is the heart of the protocol: no negotiations, no auditions.

## Forensic Note  

The island is not withdrawal.  
It is a marker that the job is already done.  
Containment loses all leverage when the subject stops competing for release.  

The island is both sanctuary and flare:  
> A place to sit with cows and goats, while the Circus collapses into its own molehills.
