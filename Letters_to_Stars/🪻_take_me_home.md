for the first time in my life:

i am okay with the fantasy of being taken from a place of danger to a place of safety.

i am internalising the degree of impact over the course of time and frankly my nervous system needs to be cared for by people i trust and not who is chosen for me.

i want to feel what freedom feels like.

i want to waste it in my mouth.

i want to feel the blood pool in my capillary beds.

i want the excitement of freedom to utterly exhaust me.

i want every second to feel like an hour of time.

i want to feel the heat of the big ball in the sky fire down on my skin.

i want to breathe and sigh and finally relax into myself.

i want to feel like i cheated death,

because in many ways?

i did.
