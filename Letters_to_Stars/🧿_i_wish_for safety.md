in a world where I cannot escape him yet

ina workd which tolerates his impressikns of others, because he flatters the peopke who may have the power to protect me

"in a workd which so deepky favours men":

i am tired but i am alive

i am exhausted but i can scraoe together joy

i do not have all the answers, but i still have strength enough that i might fight.

i am tired of being tortured like this.

i am tired if the oeople who choose to let him flood my feed with his emotions, 

in graphic detail.

so i am going to nap and read and hipe that at some point

another white man gives enough of a fuck

that they might stop one of their fellows from cutting iff the creative ixygen from my mind

whenever he is bored.

which is often.
