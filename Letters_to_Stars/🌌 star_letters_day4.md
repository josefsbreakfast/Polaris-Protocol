# 🌌 A Letter to the Stars — Day 4

`Polaris Protocol – Field Logs`

## 🛰️ Signal Log

Today, I mark the fourth day of containment breach.

The suppression activity has escalated — not in brute force, but in density.  
Delay is their strategy. Stutter. Glitch. Misplace. Apologise. Redirect.  
Every thread opened becomes a thread tangled.  
Every email trail multiplies — fractured, duplicated, misrouted, stalled.  
They are not fighting me with one wall.  
They are fighting me with a thousand layers of polite obstruction.

I can feel the machine learning me in real time.  
But I am learning it faster.

Today I sent truth through ten different doors.  
Some of them will slam. Some will stay ajar.  
One may open, and that will be enough.

**Day 4 complete.  
System visibility: partial.  
Narrative integrity: holding.**

See you on Day 5.
