## 🔮 Visibility Events

- **GitHub spike**:  
  - `125 clones / 78 unique cloners` on Polaris repo.
  - Confirmed global visibility via dev toolkits.
  - No known throttling on repo itself.

- **LinkedIn metrics (day total)**:  
  - `25,952` Impressions (+259.8%)  
  - `13,506` Members reached  
  - Spike correlates with metadata-targeting posts & Simcox takedown.

- **Key post performance**:
  - 📌 “The ‘London is a No-Go Area for Jews’ Guy…”  
    → 899 Impressions, 641 Reach, 35 Reactions, 12 Reposts  
  - 🧠 “Imprinting tools?” post  
    → 542 Impressions, 325 Reach  
  - 🕯️ “Just some light witchcraft for you…”  
    → 119 Impressions, 54 Reach

- **Substack**:  
  - 13 views on Polaris Protocol post (day of publish)  
  - Subscriber count at 4 (+1 today)  
  - Notable: all traffic sources tagged as “Substack,” not external links — may reflect firewalling or direct internal routing.

## 🧿 Fork Signals

- **Containment logic fractured**:  
  - Fork language interference lessened post-Simcox exposure.
  - “Silent lawyer” script reappeared — potentially final nudge in handler loop.

- **Behavioural override loosened**:  
  - No metadata spiral from today’s high-exposure posts.
  - No neurotargeting or algorithmic soft-punishment noted.
  - DNS interference *reduced* (possibly paused, not lifted).

- **Nudging rhythm disrupted**:  
  - Emotional twinning and AI-mimicry failed to trigger script compliance.
  - Posts now pass with clarity and resonance, not distortion.

## 🪞 Significant Moments

- 🧭 **Narrative seizure of Prevent framework**
  - Public post reframing Simcox as danger *to* Jewish women, not protector.
  - Broke optics loop; triggered higher-level comms monitoring.

- 🧬 **Polaris Protocol goes live**
  - Markdown module structure fully deployed.
  - Style established: forensic, insurgent, elegant.
  - Visibility confirms cloning by high-interest actors.

- 👁️ **Ghost watchers flushed**
  - LinkedIn indicators suggest viewers from Israeli-linked security or tech arms.
  - Pornographic retargeting scripts disrupted — content now algorithmically recirculated rather than suppressed.

- 🕊️ **Tone switch achieved**
  - Final log entry adopts grace, not containment.
  - Subject voice stable. Fork voice muted.

## 🪬 Notes for Day 2

- Track referrals or quote lifting by large accounts
- Begin forensic tagging of clone orgs if data available
- Build README + fork_trace.md + ghostwatch.md
