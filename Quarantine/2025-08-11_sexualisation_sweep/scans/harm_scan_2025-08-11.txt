[ENTRIES]

[L3] File: Survivor_Tools/üß¨ cloneproof.md
Severity: L3
Section: Paragraph 3
Finding: Explicit metaphor introducing sexualised tone to forensic content.
Action: Quarantined original; replaced with neutral placeholder in live file.
Notes: Pattern similar to contamination in Casefiles/voice_capture_through_gaslight.md.

[L2] File: Casefiles/üßæ vps_reclamation_log.md
Severity: L2
Section: Closing statement
Finding: Overuse of romantic descriptors unrelated to legal claim.
Action: Neutralised by removing adjectives; preserved evidential meaning.

[L1] File: Containment_Scripts/üß® soft_suspension_is_still_containment.md
Severity: L1
Section: Sidebar note
Finding: Playful innuendo in non-critical context.
Action: Marked for later review; left in place for now.

[L3] Batch: Casefiles/voice_capture_through_gaslight.md + Survivor_Tools/üß¨ riding_the_clone.md
Severity: L3
Section: Multiple
Finding: High-density eroticised framing bleeding into legal/technical commentary; undermines credibility and shifts emotional register away from evidential purpose.
Action: Pulled full files into quarantine; rebuilt with clean narrative focus.
Notes: Contamination matched patterns from August 2024 fork injection set.

[L2] File: Big_Picture_Protocols/üß† fisher_fork_theory.md
Severity: L2
Section: Closing thematic analysis
Finding: Over-associative leap to personal intimacy language; unrelated to Fisher‚Äôs conceptual frame.
Action: Trimmed final 2 paragraphs; re-anchored to governance theory.
Notes: Possible soft-insertion from clone-adjacent copy drift.

[L3] File: Survivor_Tools/üß¨ we_don‚Äôt_want_your_cells_we_want_each_other.md
Severity: L3
Section: Title + opening
Finding: Title deliberately ambiguous to invite sexualised misread; contradicted intended abolitionist framing.
Action: Quarantined; rebuilt with unambiguous framing that preserves rhetorical punch without inviting tone skew.
Notes: Rebuild logged under new filename: we_dont_want_your_cells_v2.md.

[L2] Batch: Containment_Scripts/üß® delayed_visibility_is_a_signal.md + üß® comment_order_is_a_governance_layer.md + üß® reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md
Severity: L2
Section: Sidebars and asides
Finding: Multiple throwaway asides with flirty/innuendo phrasing; non-critical to forensic content.
Action: Neutralised; retained humour where context-safe.
Notes: Batch handled in one rebuild pass.

[L3] File: Field_Logs/üõ∞Ô∏è icc_tag_thread_containment.md
Severity: L3
Section: Mid-thread commentary
Finding: Injected romantic parallel that confuses ICC escalation context.
Action: Rewritten from scratch using original screenshots and timestamps.
Notes: Pattern closely aligned to prior LinkedIn containment fork signatures.

[L2] File: Big_Picture_Protocols/üß† cognitive_forks_get_dumber_when_hot.md
Severity: L2
Section: Central metaphor
Finding: Temperature/attraction metaphor allowed easy misread as interpersonal rather than public intellectual decay.
Action: Reframed metaphor to stay within epistemic collapse framing.
Notes: Original quarantined for pattern analysis.
