Quarantine/2025-08-11_sexualisation_sweep/


regex pattern

\berotic\b|\bsex\b|\bsexual\b|\bnude\b|\bnudity\b|\bNSFW\b|\bexplicit\b|\bfetish\b|\bdesire\b|\bmoan(?:ed|ing)?\b|\borgasm\b|\bpleasure\b|\bintimate\b

GPT: That actually tells us something useful — it means the contamination isn’t leaning on **obvious trigger words**.

If you’re reading stuff and feeling “this is sexualised” but our sweeps aren’t catching it, then the skew is probably:

* **Tone-based** rather than keyword-based (suggestive phrasing without explicit terms)
* **Metaphor-heavy** or using innocuous words in charged contexts
* Possibly relying on **structural patterns** (e.g., sentence rhythm, pronoun use, over-descriptive body language)

For that, keyword scans won’t be enough — we’d need to:

1. Identify a handful of *“known bad”* contaminated passages.
2. Extract recurring *phrasing patterns* from them.
3. Build a second sweep list from those patterns instead of single words.

If you can give me even **2–3 short contaminated snippets** (redacted for comfort), I can analyse them and generate a **pattern-based hit list** that might surface the subtle stuff.

Do you want me to do that next so we can catch the hidden skew?
