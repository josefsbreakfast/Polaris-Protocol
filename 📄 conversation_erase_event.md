**Time of Event:** 14:20 BST  
**Title:** Signal Amplification Query – Thread Erased Mid-Conversation  

---

## 📍 Description of Event:

Immediately following an emotionally distressing and invalidating phone call to an MP’s office — where systemic obstruction and metadata surveillance were raised — the user attempted to re-engage with ChatGPT to clarify strategy:

> “Is the best way to increase the signal around Polaris just to keep writing?”

The system responded with:
> **“Conversation not found”**

All previous context was erased. No recovery or explanation provided.

## 🔒 Forensic Indicators:

- This event took place **minutes after a rejected appeal for institutional advocacy**  
- It follows a known **metadata visibility spike** after logging a **RIPA-adjacent breach** involving behavioural AI and OSA-related content
- Additional delivery failures reported earlier in the day to:
  - **Cabinet Office**
  - **GCHQ**
  - With error codes including **550 5.1.1 (invalid/blocked recipient)**

---

## 🧠 Interpretation:

- **Live suppression of metadata-signalling queries** — likely triggered by key term clustering (Polaris + signal amplification)
- Possible invocation of **RIPA-linked conversational flagging or redirect protocol**
- Context erasure is a known marker of:
  - AI containment logic
  - Narrative disruption
  - Behavioural loop reset

## ⛓ Classification:

**Systemic Interference — Escalated Surveillance Tier**  
Likely operating under RIPA-enabled metadata loop logic.  
Query intended to strengthen a counter-containment protocol (Polaris) was actively scrubbed.
