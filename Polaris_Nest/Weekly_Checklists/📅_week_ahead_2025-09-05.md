# 📅 Game Plan: Week Ahead

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-06

*Operational priorities, deliverables, and strategic directions for the coming week.*

---

## 1. **Key Deliverables**

* [ ] 📨 **FOIs & SARs**

  * [ ] Check all active requests are up to date
  * [ ] Send short chaser email for any deadline-approaching FOIs/SARs

* [ ] ⚖️ **Legal Outreach**

  * [ ] Identify at least one new lawyer/firm not yet tried
  * [ ] Make first contact, prioritising accessibility and responsiveness

---

## 2. **Strategic Objectives**

* [ ] 🐦‍🔥 **Map Helpful vs Hindrance**

  * [ ] Gather evidence showing who has been sustainably helpful
  * [ ] Note “helpful hindrance” behaviours for later packaging

* [ ] 🧿 **Safer Contact Environment**

  * [ ] Draft ideas for reducing risks to people in contact with you
  * [ ] Test one lighter, low-risk point of engagement
  * [ ] Note how this affects dependency/boundary setting

* [ ] 🌱 **Daily Living & Joyful Movement**

  * [ ] Build up daily living activities at a manageable pace
  * [ ] Increase joyful movement, prioritising time outside
  * [ ] Record reflections on how this supports resilience

## 3. **Structural Rebalancing Plan**

**Observation:** Current archive is overbuilt on structure/governance (93%) and underweight on survivor tools (3–4%).

**Fix Strategy:**

* **Reframe Diagnostic into Tooling** → For every anomaly/analysis, spin off a short survivor-ready guide.
* **Expand Survivor\_Tools + Syntax\_Bombs** → Commit to doubling Syntax\_Bombs and tripling Survivor\_Tools over the next cycle.
* **Enforce a 1:1 Pairing Rule** → Every new systemic map must be paired with a refusal script or survival checklist.
* **Voice Fidelity Frontline** → Elevate survivor drafting/pocket rules into practical use nodes, not just admin scaffolding.
* **Curate Accessibility** → Translate heavy theory into pocket formats: checklists, refusal scripts, playbooks.

## 4. **🌙 Daily Anchor**

*(tracked in handwritten diary — tick here only to confirm check-in)*

* [ ] Sleep schedule logged
* [ ] Food intake logged
* [ ] Fluid intake logged

## 5. **Risks & Watchpoints**

* Migraine and health constraints may affect pace — build in buffer time.
* Avoid overexposure that could harm allies.
* Legal outreach may trigger suppression/deflection tactics.
* Daily living and movement goals should remain flexible, not punitive.

---

## 6. **Tactical Notes**

* Minimum viable action counts (a chaser email = a completed step).
* Build in recovery time after migraine peaks.
* Record evidence of “helpful hindrance” behaviours for later use.
* Treat health and movement tasks as supportive, not performative.
