**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*Operational priorities, deliverables, and strategic directions for the coming week*  

---

## 1. **Key Deliverables**  
- [ ] 📨 **FOIs & SARs**  
  - [ ] Check all active requests are up to date  
  - [ ] Send short chaser email for any deadline-approaching FOIs/SARs  

- [ ] ⚖️ **Legal Outreach**  
  - [ ] Identify at least one new lawyer/firm not yet tried  
  - [ ] Make first contact, prioritising accessibility and responsiveness  

---

## 2. **Strategic Objectives**  
- [ ] 🐦‍🔥 **Map Helpful vs Hindrance**  
  - [ ] Gather evidence showing who has been sustainably helpful  
  - [ ] Note “helpful hindrance” behaviours for later packaging  

- [ ] 🧿 **Safer Contact Environment**  
  - [ ] Draft ideas for reducing risks to people in contact with you  
  - [ ] Test one lighter, low-risk point of engagement  
  - [ ] Note how this affects dependency/boundary setting  

---

## 3. **Risks & Watchpoints**  
- Migraine and health constraints may affect pace — build in buffer time.  
- Avoid overexposure that could harm allies.  
- Legal outreach may trigger suppression/deflection tactics.  

---

## 4. **Tactical Notes**  
- Minimum viable action counts (a chaser email = a completed step).  
- Build in recovery time after migraine peaks.  
- Record evidence of “helpful hindrance” behaviours for later use.
