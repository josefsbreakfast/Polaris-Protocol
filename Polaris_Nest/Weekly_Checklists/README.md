# 📅 Weekly Checklists  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*Rolling operational trackers to sequence deliverables, objectives, and strategic focus week by week*  

---

## Purpose  
The **Weekly Checklists** folder provides a dedicated space for short-horizon operational planning.  
Each file captures one week’s priorities, tactical notes, and strategic alignments.  

- Keeps immediate actions visible.  
- Prevents drift from urgent to strategic.  
- Establishes a cross-referenced trail for FOIs, SARs, legal outreach, and ally mapping.  

---

## File Naming  
- `📅_week_ahead_YYYY-MM-DD.md`  
- Date corresponds to the anchor day when the checklist is drafted (e.g. Friday start).  
- Each file follows standard Polaris document format with tickbox checklists.  

---

## Usage  
- Open the week’s file and mark tasks complete (`[x]`) as you progress.  
- Carry forward any unfinished items to the next week’s checklist.  
- Cross-link tasks back to Admin Kit, Field Logs, or Survivor Tools when relevant.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Weekly Checklists* are a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
They balance near-term deliverables with longer strategic direction, providing continuity across shifting conditions.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
