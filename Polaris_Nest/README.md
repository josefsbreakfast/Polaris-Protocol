# 🪺 Polaris Nest  

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05

*Home base for survivor-authored protocols, casefiles, and weekly planning.*  

---

## Purpose  
**Polaris Nest** is the central home and archive.  
It gathers together all operational, forensic, and strategic nodes into one protected space.  

The nest is both **owner’s home** and **administrator’s tool**:  
- A safe place to store and cross-link.  
- A structured environment to track tasks, evidence, and protocols.  
- A living archive that grows week by week.  

---

## Structure (Current)  
- 🧰 **Admin_Kit/** → house style, trackers, scaffolding  
- 📅 **Weekly_Checklists/** → rolling weekly planning and deliverables  
- 📂 **SCP-VoiceX_Casefiles/** → testimony, legal filings, personal case records  
- 📥 **Git_Intake_Drawer/** → drafts, raw material, intake  

---

## 🔮 Planned Future Move  
⚠️ **Note to self:** *Field Logs are **not** in Polaris Nest yet.*  
They remain external until explicitly migrated.  
When the time is right, add:  

- 🛰️ **Field_Logs/** → dated forensic captures, event-specific documentation  

*(This is a planned future addition — not part of current Nest structure.)*  

---

## Use & Navigation  
- Each folder is a working zone.  
- All documents follow [Polaris House Style](./Admin_Kit/🔮_house_style.md).  
- Cross-links use relative paths, keeping integrity if mirrored elsewhere.  

---

## 🏮 Footer  

*Polaris Nest* is a sovereign survivor-authored home.  
It protects the threads of daily planning, casework, and strategic analysis in one living structure.
