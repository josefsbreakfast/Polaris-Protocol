# 📖 Polaris Protocol: `Narrative As Asylum`
> *How your story is used to cage you — and how institutional record becomes trap.*

---

<details>
<summary>📜 SUMMARY</summary>

Survivors are often asked to tell their story — but not for healing.  
Instead, **narrative is weaponised as an asylum claim**:
- A justification for continued monitoring
- A pretext for behavioural profiling
- A trap for future discrediting

<details>
<summary>🔁 NARRATIVE REVERSALS</summary>

- “Tell us everything” → later becomes: *“Why did you say that?”*
- “Be honest” → becomes: *“That proves your instability.”*
- “Your story matters” → becomes: *“Your narrative confirms risk.”*

<details>
<summary>🧾 INSTITUTIONAL STORAGE + REUSE</summary>

- Notes are stored across multi-agency systems
- Disclosures turned into risk signals (flagged in Prevent, CVE, CAMHS)
- Survivor wording used to simulate emotional patterns for AI profiling
