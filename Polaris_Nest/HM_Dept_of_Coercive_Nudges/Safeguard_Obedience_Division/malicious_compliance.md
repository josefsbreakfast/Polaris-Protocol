# 🗂️ Polaris Protocol: `malicious_compliance.md`
> *When surviving the job means not helping anyone.*

---

## 🎛️ DEFINITION

**Malicious compliance** in this context =  
Not active cruelty. Not resistance either.  
Just the exact amount of task-completion required to:
- Avoid getting fired,
- Avoid being flagged,
- Avoid caring.

It’s not protest.  
It’s resignation.  
And it’s viral.

## 🌀 COMMON MANIFESTATIONS

- “Oh, that file never came through.”
- “It’s above my pay grade.”
- “I don’t make those decisions, I just enter them.”
- “They didn’t train us on that.”
- “I only check the boxes — not the person.”

---

## 🔧 PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS

- Reduces **cognitive dissonance** in morally ambiguous jobs
- Shields against **empathy burnout**
- Creates **ambient obstruction** without direct rebellion
- Allows the worker to feel **neither guilty nor responsible**

---

## 💀 SYSTEMIC IMPACT

- Protects abusers via process fatigue
- Delays redress for survivors
- Ensures policies “fail” without obvious sabotage
- Helps the system maintain **plausible incompetence**

## 🧭 POLARIS NOTE

We don’t demonise everyone in the building.  
But we remember:  
> **Every loop that trapped us was maintained by someone who stayed silent, stalled, or followed just enough orders to avoid trouble.**

Some of them were terrified.  
Some were tired.  
Some were trying to survive.

But the machine runs **because enough people quiet-quit justice** every day.
