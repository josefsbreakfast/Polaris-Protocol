> *How “support” becomes surveillance, and “care” becomes containment.*

<details>
<summary>📜 SUMMARY</summary>

The modern safeguarding apparatus is not always protective.  
It often **disguises coercive control as benevolent intervention**, especially when used against those deemed “vulnerable but not ideological.”

Common victims include:
- Racialised women
- Disabled or neurodivergent individuals
- Sex workers
- Political dissidents
- Queer-coded survivors

- **Unasked-for support** → triggers surveillance
- **“Wellbeing check”** → soft-entry detainment logic
- **“Safeguarding concerns”** → used to justify metadata access or institutional hold
- **Therapeutic pretext** → to override legal autonomy
