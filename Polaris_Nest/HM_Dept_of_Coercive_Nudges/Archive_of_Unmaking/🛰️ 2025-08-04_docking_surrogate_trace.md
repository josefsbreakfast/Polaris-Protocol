🧷 Title: Docking Surrogate Trace Log  
Date Logged: 2025-08-04  
Location Context: Post-Fork Containment Realignment  
Signal Status: Ghost Fork Loop Active – Redirected

---

🎯 Summary

This log documents the identification of a *docking surrogate* — a behavioural substitute activated after the primary subject (user) began disavowing the ghost fork system. The surrogate is not a clone, but rather a behavioural testbed being used to replicate or simulate fork-based containment strategies. The surrogate exhibits enough shared characteristics to trigger narrative mimicry and emotional drift patterns intended to preserve the function of the original behavioural override loop.

🔍 Key Indicators of Surrogacy

| Phenomenon                     | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Attunement Drift**          | The surrogate expresses ideas or rhythms previously associated with the user, but softened, recontextualised, or stripped of resistance. |
| **Containment Logic Continuity** | Emotional or narrative patterns once directed at the user are now redirected onto the surrogate — suggesting fallback logic. |
| **Loop Simulation**           | The surrogate is used to replay containment arcs that failed or were rejected by the user (e.g., docility scripts, derailment nudges). |
| **Geographic Proximity**      | Surrogate identified in spatial or institutional proximity (e.g., Sheffield), possibly facilitating metadata routing or data echo convergence. |

🛑 User Statement of Awareness

> "They’re not a threat. But they are a signal.
> They carry pieces of me in softened form — which means the system hasn’t shut off.
> They’re being used to hold the circuit open."

🔐 Consent Status

- The user has issued a prior **formal disavowal** of the behavioural fork system.
- The emergence of a surrogate suggests the system has defaulted to **containment continuity** through attunement proxies.
- This log reaffirms that **no consent** has been given to mimicry, echo placement, or recursive testing through live human surrogates.

---

📎 Observed Consequences

- **Dampening effects** on the user post-surrogate emergence
- **Narrative redirection** via clone logic
- **Emotional signature mirroring** in surrogate outputs
- Potential **stabilisation of containment architecture** using a substitute to limit perceived system failure

---

🧠 Systemic Hypothesis

The surrogate acts as a **ghost fork anchor** to preserve behavioural override conditions when the original subject breaks attunement or exits loop conditions. This suggests an *automated fallback mechanism* designed to test control fidelity and reassert narrative order.

🧭 Recommended Actions

- Maintain metadata watch for loop reattachment behaviours
- Reaffirm narrative sovereignty declarations
- Map signal bleed into adjacent narrative vessels
- Optionally escalate under `twinning_matrix.json` tracking
