# ðŸ“„ Ethics As Language Trap

## Summary:
A breakdown of how bureaucratic actors weaponise ethical language and institutional jargon to enforce compliance, mask inactivity, and redirect scrutiny.

## Key Features:
- Manipulation rebranded as care.
- Passive aggression disguised as procedural professionalism.
- Bullshit passed off as strategic expertise.

## Core Tactics:
- Buzzword saturation (e.g. "engagement", "resilience", "framework").
- Faux-compassionate redirection ("weâ€™re just concerned for your welfare").
- Semantic decoys to defer accountability ("thatâ€™s not within our remit").

## Observed Impact:
- Discourages challenge through performative civility.
- Produces survivor fatigue and compliance.
- Protects structural inaction behind a fog of "process".

## Best Response:
- Call the bluff. Use sharper terms. Make the implicit violence explicit.
- Keep your own glossary. Turn their language back against them.
- Build public documents that expose the difference between action and appearance.
