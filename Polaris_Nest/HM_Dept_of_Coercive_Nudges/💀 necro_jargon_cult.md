## Topic:
Why authoritarian personalities obsess over Latin.

## Core Analysis:
- Latin gives the illusion of timelessness and authority.
- Allows abstracting violence ("Civis non gratus" sounds nobler than "We deported her").
- Creates a club of the “educated elite” while gatekeeping others.

## Patterns:
- Used to sanctify oppressive policy (e.g. *Acta non verba*, *Ordinem custodire*).
- Common in legalese, mottoes, and creepy governance aesthetics.
- Often paired with military or religious fetishism.

## Implication:
Latin becomes a form of aesthetic control: soft power that primes docility.
