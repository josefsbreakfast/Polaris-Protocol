<summary>📜 SUMMARY</summary>

Behavioural loops are the core mechanic of compliance modelling.

They are:
- **Predictive**: trained on prior response patterns.
- **Self-reinforcing**: collapse becomes evidence of instability.
- **Emotionally coercive**: tuned to provoke shame, despair, or docility.

The loop does not need you to believe.  
It just needs you to repeat.

<summary>🔁 EXAMPLES OF LOOP TEMPLATES</summary>

- **Obedience Loop**: “Good behaviour” is rewarded with temporary silence → misbehaviour punished with escalation
- **Disclosure Loop**: Ask for the story, punish its retelling
- **Isolation Loop**: Remove support → watch for collapse → use collapse to justify isolation
- **Erotic Loop**: Sexualise reaction → reward collapse → shame response

- Condition the user to become *predictably compliant*, not necessarily convinced
- Weaponise surrender by embedding guilt into the rhythm
