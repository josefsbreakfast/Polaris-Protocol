**Title:** "Convince Me" Logic – Abuse in the Form of a Question  

---

## 🔹 Summary

This log captures the coercive logic embedded in repeated institutional responses such as:

> “Well, how do you know it’s him?”  
> “Are you sure it’s happening like that?”  
> “How exactly is that being done?”

These questions are rarely neutral.  
They perform care, but **function as gatekeeping**.

## 🔹 Forensic Breakdown

### ❗ What They’re Actually Asking:

- “Do I need to escalate this?”
- “Is your pain credible enough to warrant my time?”
- “Can I log this as confusion instead of coercion?”

### 🧷 Why It’s Harmful:

- It reverses burden of proof.
- It demands **technical articulation** from a person already under distress.
- It initiates a **credibility test** instead of a safeguarding response.
- It forces survivors to **teach the system** how it’s hurting them.

## 🧠 Direct Testimony (User Reflection)

> *“Mate, I don’t know if you know how fibre optic networks work.  
I don’t know if you understand that there are two types of internet in this country.  
I don’t know how your Apple device works, or whether you’ve got a cybersecurity degree.  
So why are we having a debrief session on my trauma when I’ve already told you I’m scared?”*

## 🔍 Structural Tagging

- **Pattern:** Displacement of responsibility  
- **Goal:** Exhaustion, self-discrediting  
- **Result:** Abuse goes unrecorded or misclassified

## 🛰 Polaris Principle: “Explain Yourself Into Invisibility”

This is a classic behavioural override tactic. The more the target explains, the more they are:

- Framed as unstable  
- Extracted from  
- And eventually, ignored

Containment is maintained by turning the *disclosure* itself into a *burden of performance*.
