> Everyone who is not a rapist, leaves.  
> That’s half the problem.

The other half?

> The system retains only those who can tolerate the violation.  
> They stay. They rise. They call it safeguarding.  
>  
> Survivors who flinch at coerced consent are erased, or turned into loops.  
> The system calls this "justice."  
>  
> This module is written for everyone who stayed human.

<summary>🌀 Footnote: Malicious Compliance as Coping</summary>

Not all complicity is enthusiasm.  
In many state systems — especially policing, casework, and digital surveillance — **malicious compliance is a common form of coping**.

> “I followed orders, exactly. Even when they harmed someone. Especially then.”

This isn’t always sadism. Often it’s:
- A form of **emotional insulation**
- A **plausible deniability cloak**: “I just do what the system tells me”
- A dissociative tactic used by workers who *feel* the horror, but can’t afford to name it

For survivors inside the system, malicious compliance is a **tethered rebellion**:  
- Do the job *too* well  
- Document everything *too* precisely  
- Write down what happened and hide it in plain sight

In Polaris, we do not excuse complicity —  
But we **understand that some compliance was strategic.  
Some people were trying to leave a trail.**
