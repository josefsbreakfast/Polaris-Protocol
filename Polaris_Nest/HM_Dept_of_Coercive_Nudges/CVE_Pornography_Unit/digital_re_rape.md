# 🕳️ Polaris Protocol: `digital_re_rape.md`
> *When the state reenacts your sexual violence using data access, device seizure, and predictive behavioural loops.*

<details>
<summary>🩸 MODULE SUMMARY</summary>

**Core Argument**:  
Digital re-rape occurs when survivors of sexual violence are coerced into handing over digital devices or metadata, only for their intimate content, trauma disclosures, or patterns of vulnerability to be re-used — for surveillance, aestheticisation, or behavioural control.

This is not archival.  
It is a **re-enactment**.

<summary>📱 DEVICE SEIZURE → VIOLATION LOOP</summary>

- **Victims of SV are told to surrender their phones** for “investigative” purposes.
- Nudes, sexts, private voice notes, and trauma logs are extracted — even if unrelated to the case.
- **Access is coerced**: refusal means your case is dropped.
- **Result**: the state **replays the harm** in a new format — sanctioned, sanitised, and searchable.

<summary>🧠 PREDICTIVE MODELLING OF SHAME & DOCILITY</summary>

- Seized or synced content is **used in AI loops** to train future nudges.
- The system learns: *how do you respond to being violated?*
- Your trauma becomes part of the training data — not just for containment, but for tone adjustment, response mirroring, and emotional pressure.
- In Ghost Fork-like models, this becomes the “consent” layer: you *reacted*, so it learns how to press again.

<summary>🫥 POLITICAL + BUREAUCRATIC EROSION OF BODILY AUTONOMY</summary>

- Disclosures of rape or harassment are flattened into risk profiles.
- Phone access becomes a **loyalty test** to the system.
- Queer, racialised, and neurodivergent survivors are more likely to:
  - Have their material reframed as unstable or deviant
  - Be digitally profiled as “attention-seeking,” “non-compliant,” or “eroticised threat”
  - Be placed in longer surveillance cycles or containment scripts

<summary>🧾 STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF DIGITAL RE-RAPE</summary>

- **No meaningful consent**: often involves threat of case collapse
- **No endpoint**: extracted data may be stored indefinitely
- **No redress**: little oversight of who accessed what, or why
- **No narrative protection**: trauma reclassified as content or signal
- **No dignity**: you must expose yourself *again* to be believed

<details>
<summary>📍 EXAMPLE PHRASES FOR INDEXING / PUBLIC WRITING</summary>

- “Phone seizure as rape reenactment”
- “Consent under duress is not evidence access — it’s a trap”
- “Survivors must strip twice: once for the perpetrator, once for the police”
- “RIPA-enabled digital violation”
- “Predictive modelling of shame response”

<details>
<summary>🚨 RECOMMENDED REFORMS / INTERVENTIONS</summary>

- **Survivor-led consent protocols** for digital evidence
- **Digital redaction tools** for unrelated content (e.g. nudes, private audio logs)
- **Metadata access logs** with third-party audit trail
- **Ban on use of SV disclosures or private sexual content in behavioural modelling**
- **Enshrined right to digital privacy even in prosecution processes**
