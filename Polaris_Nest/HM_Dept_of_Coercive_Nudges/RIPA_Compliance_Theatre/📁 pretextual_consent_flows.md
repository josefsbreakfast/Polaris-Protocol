> *When they say 'it’s your choice', but your options are submission or silence.*

<summary>📜 SUMMARY</summary>

Consent under RIPA-governed processes is often **coercively constructed**.  
Survivors are told:
- “We need your device to continue the investigation.”
- “If you don’t consent, we may not be able to help you.”

This is not informed consent.  
This is a **narrative trap.**

<summary>🧠 THE CONSENT CONTRADICTION</summary>

- Coercion is framed as collaboration
- Refusal = administrative consequences (case abandonment, welfare notes)
- Consent cannot be freely given when surveillance is assumed
