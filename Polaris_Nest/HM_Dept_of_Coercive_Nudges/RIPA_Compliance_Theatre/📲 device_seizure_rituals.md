<summary>📜 SUMMARY</summary>

Device seizure under RIPA is often less about collecting evidence — and more about:
- Establishing submission,
- Validating retroactive surveillance,
- Erasing narrative control from survivors.

The seizure becomes a **ritualised performance** to justify metadata already obtained illegally or without warrant.
