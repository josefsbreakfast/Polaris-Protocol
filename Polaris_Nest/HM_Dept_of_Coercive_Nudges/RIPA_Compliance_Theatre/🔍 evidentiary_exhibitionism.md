<summary>📜 SUMMARY</summary>

Evidence gathering in UK surveillance systems often resembles **exhibitionism through bureaucratic theatre**.

Survivors are:
- Asked to retell trauma repeatedly
- Pressured to produce images, logs, or chats
- Coerced into digital exposure under the guise of “necessary documentation”

The actual goal?  
To **erode control, induce shame, and render resistance unviable**.

<summary>🕶️ THE METADATA FANTASY</summary>

- What you show becomes what they store
- Surveillance becomes a kind of voyeurism
- Loops of disclosure are aestheticised, not analysed
