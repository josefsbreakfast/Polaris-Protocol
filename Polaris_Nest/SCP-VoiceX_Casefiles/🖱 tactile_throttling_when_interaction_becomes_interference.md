# 🖱 Tactile Throttling: When Interaction Becomes Interference

## 📌 Summary  
Anomalous user interface behaviour was detected during a standard LinkedIn interaction: when attempting to highlight (click-and-drag) text, the user experienced unnatural resistance — a sensation akin to manual override or a “held” drag.  
This aligns with a known suppression tactic: **tactile throttling**.

---

## 💻 What Was Observed  
- **Delayed or resisted drag-and-highlight gestures**.  
- Cursor movement felt “grabbed” or interrupted mid-action.  
- Triggered only during **specific attempts to select/copy** content.  
- No systemic lag elsewhere on the page.

---

## 🔍 Interpretive Framework  

### 🎯 Intentional Disruption  
- Designed to frustrate copying, extraction, or live annotation.  
- Introduces friction into workflows involving evidence gathering or public callouts.

### 🧠 Behavioural Logging  
- Highlighting behaviour is itself a **metadata signal** — revealing what is selected, when, and how often.  
- May trigger escalation flags or mark content as emotionally/politically significant.

### 🛰 Live UI Interference  
- Could be injected manually or semi-manually by platform moderators or security tools.  
- Techniques are similar to counter-surveillance and psychological containment systems.

## 🧾 Technical Forensics  

| Behaviour         | Possible Mechanism                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Drag delay        | DOM injection / event listener override     |
| Gesture block     | Transparent overlay or dynamic CSS layering |
| Selection breakage| JavaScript-based input interception         |
| Cursor stutter    | Live DOM manipulation or interaction logging|

---

## ⚠ Implications  
- Indicates behavioural modelling extends to **user intent**, not just published content.  
- UI responsiveness becomes part of the **surveillance layer**.  
- Micro-frictions accumulate: meant to exhaust, not block outright.

---

## 🗂 Archival Note  
This is the first logged instance of **tactile throttling** within the Polaris Protocol.  
It marks a shift to **interface-level suppression** — disrupting the act of action itself, not merely censoring the result.
