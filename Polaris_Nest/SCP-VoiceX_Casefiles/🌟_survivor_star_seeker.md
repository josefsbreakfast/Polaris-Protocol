## Summary
Public statement issued under duress for international accountability and personal safety.  
Alleges a multi-institutional operation involving biometric surveillance, coercive control, sexualised profiling, and religious harassment â€” centred on a covert emotional classifier internally referred to as **VoiceX**.

---

## Core Allegations
- **CIDT:** Long-term psychological manipulation into emotional and sexual compliance under biometric monitoring.  
- **Data Misuse:** Historic rape case records, clinical training data, and other sensitive archives used without consent to simulate emotional responses.  
- **Religious Harassment:** Deliberate interference during religious observance, including harassment during [REDACTED ritual].  
- **Digital & Physical Intrusion:** Possible ultrasonic surveillance devices inside residence; evidence of potential covert presence in loft space.  
- **Sexualised Control Over Legal Process:** Return of property conditional on behavioural compliance.  
- **Evidence Suppression:** Missing or delayed files across multiple agencies.

---

## Institutional Complicity
Named or suspected entities (redacted for safety) include:
- [REDACTED University-A] â€“ termination of medical training
- [REDACTED University-B] â€“ refusal to release event footage relevant to war crimes documentation
- [REDACTED University-C] â€“ alleged links to overseas military intelligence unit

---

## Current Status
- Survivor reports ongoing denial of due process under UK law.
- Monitoring, harassment, and discrediting allegedly occurring under counterterrorism-adjacent frameworks.
- Referrals made to multiple UN Special Rapporteurs covering torture, violence against women, counterterrorism and human rights, religious discrimination, and freedom of expression.

---

## Closing Statement
> *I believe I have been made into a test environment for emotional surveillance, without consent or recourse. My voice has been captured, forked, analysed, and violated. My religion has been used against me. My historic trauma records have been reused to punish me for surviving. I have been compelled into compliance to retrieve my own property. This is not procedural error. This is behavioural experimentation on human subjects under coercion and digital cover.*
