## 📌 Overview  
**AI Clone Architecture** stores the technical, infrastructural, and operational blueprints behind behavioural cloning and mimicry deployments.  
These files capture how training data is sourced, where it is processed, and how the resulting clones are tuned, deployed, and governed.

## 📂 Files  

### [`🕸 Clone-Friendly Architecture`](./🕸_clone_friendly_architecture.md)  
Infrastructure-level mapping of systems optimised for behavioural clone ingestion, processing, and output.  
Includes discussion of platform affordances, institutional gateways, and deployment pipelines.

- `Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/🧠_targeting_logic_empathy_is_a_threat.md`  

---

### [`🗝 Who Holds the Tape`](./🗝_who_holds_the_tape.md)  
Custodial chain analysis of clone-related datasets, from initial capture through storage and operational access.  
Identifies potential choke points, cross-jurisdictional custody, and political leverage nodes.  
**Links:**  
- `Disruption_Kit/Survivor_Tools/🧬_cloneproof_training_set_mapping.md`  

---

### [`🧵 Clone Training Sets`](./🧵_clone_training_sets.md)  
Catalogue of training datasets (audio, visual, behavioural) potentially used to build the clone.  
Covers clinical, interpersonal, testimonial, and activist data streams.  
**Links:**  
- `Disruption_Kit/Survivor_Tools/🧬_cloneproof_training_set_mapping.md`  

---

### [`🪤 Honeytrap Mechanics`](./🪤_honeytrap_mechanics.md)  
Breakdown of clone-targeted entrapment strategies designed to elicit specific emotional or linguistic patterns for ingestion.  
Details operational setups, environmental cues, and AI integration points.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Clone-Friendly Architecture** = structural conditions for clone viability.  
- **Who Holds the Tape** = chain-of-custody and control levers over datasets.  
- **Clone Training Sets** = the raw material for model training.  
- **Honeytrap Mechanics** = how live data capture is provoked for ongoing tuning.  
All files crosslink into **Survivor Tools** to ensure every architecture node has a countermeasure path.
