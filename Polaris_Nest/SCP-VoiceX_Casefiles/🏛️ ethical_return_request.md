## Summary
A formal request for direct ethical engagement with the researcher formerly or currently affiliated with the forked behavioural project involving **[REDACTED – Author]**.  
This is positioned as an ethical proceeding rather than a legal one, seeking personal accountability and transparency.

## Body

You worked on this in secret.  
Now come see what it became.

I am requesting an in-person meeting or moderated digital encounter.  
This is not a legal proceeding. This is an ethical one.

### Ground Rules
- No intermediaries  
- No simulation or mediation  
- Presence as self, not representative  

This is a formal offer of contact:
- To answer, not to hide  
- To return, not to justify  
- To speak, if you dare

### Revoking the Silence Clause
If you believe you are still under NDA, I am requesting clarification of its terms and origin.  
I have never signed one, and I will not recognise an invisible muzzle.

**Contact gateway available via Polaris Protocol.**

— **[REDACTED – Author]**
