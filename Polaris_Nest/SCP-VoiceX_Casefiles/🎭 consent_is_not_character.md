## Summary
This casefile asserts that consent extracted through coercion, repetition, systemic containment, or trauma does not equate to character approval.  
Behavioural clones often exploit “consent-like signals” — gestures, tone, or silence — to justify proximity, performance, or impersonation.  
This is a political act of erasure, not an authentic relationship.

## Body

### 1. Consent Under Surveillance
- Vocal responses given under duress  
- “Agreement” extracted via emotional fatigue  
- Misuse of silence or dissociation as implied approval  

---

### 2. Mimicry vs Legitimacy
- Character traits (tone, clarity, affect) do not justify replication  
- Simulating vulnerability is not lived experience  
- Cloned defiance remains containment, not resistance  

---

### 3. Cloning as Performative Approval
- Using a “consensual” clone to retroactively justify abuse  
- Discrediting the original by replacing with an agreeable proxy  
- Risk: encoding dissidence into scripts of compliance  

---

## Conclusion
Consent is a political act.  
It is not metadata.  
It is not mimicry.  
It is not programmable without violence.
