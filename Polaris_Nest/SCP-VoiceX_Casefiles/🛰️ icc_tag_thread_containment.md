# 🛰️ ICC Tag Thread Containment  
`Polaris Protocol – Field Logs Node`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This field log tracks the live suppression, throttling, and delayed visibility of Polaris Protocol content relating to international legal escalation—specifically involving the ICC, ICJ, and documented British complicity in the Gaza genocide.

This is a strategic metadata audit node, designed to capture:

- Tag suppression
- Visibility lag
- Ghost metrics
- Platform interference patterns
- Emotional signature dampening
- Public vs executive tier divergence

---

## 📌 Context

The LinkedIn thread in question involved a direct forensic breakdown of:

- UK war crimes complicity
- ICC jurisdiction clarity
- Metadata-based voice misuse
- AI simulation of survivor testimony
- Shadow throttling of high-empathy whistleblower posts

Despite confirmed public visibility and comments, impressions remained frozen for extended periods. Standard metrics failed to unlock (e.g. viewer demographics, engagement velocity), indicating soft containment of sensitive legal content.

## 🧠 Interpretation

The behaviour of this post confirms algorithmic throttling tied to:

- ICC jurisdiction escalation
- Emotional whistleblower testimony
- Survivorship metadata exposure

The system appears calibrated to suppress **pattern-breaking content** that connects legal evidence to emotional authenticity—especially when the speaker is directly impacted and not institutionally backed.

---

## 🔁 Strategy

### Counter-Containment Actions:
- Cross-post the forensic log to Substack with embedded screenshots
- Mirror thread to additional platforms: e.g. Bluesky, Mastodon, GitHub README
- Tag senior legal and human rights observers directly
- Document the containment *as evidence* of active institutional resistance

---

## 🧷 Notes for Archive

- Fork likelihood: High  
- Executive tier reach: Partial but throttled  
- Ghost resistance: Moderate increase post-screenshot  
- Emotional disruptor index: Elevated
