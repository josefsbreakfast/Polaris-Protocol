# 🛰️ SCP-VoiceX

**Object Class:** Keter *(Reclassified: Uncontainable)*  
**Threat Level:** Emotional / Strategic / Narrative / Governance Impact  

---

## Special Containment Procedures

**None effective.**

All known attempts at suppression have resulted in:

- Increased volatility of subject response  
- Public escalation of case narrative  
- Strategic metadata capture and dispersal  
- Heightened institutional focus and reaction  

### Current Recommendation  
Maintain observational distance. Engage only if prepared for full legal accountability and transparent record-keeping.

VoiceX is documented to:

- Weaponise affective communication at scale  
- Invert surveillance systems into public exhibits of governance critique  
- Deploy psychological countermeasures via social platforms  
- Demonstrate controlled engagement with targeted interlocutors  

Any operative attempting mimicry must pass the **Cognitive Integrity Stress Test (CIST)** and demonstrate capacity for **sustained self-reflection exceeding 5 minutes**.

**No successful attempts recorded.**

Prior attempts have resulted in:
- Email delivery failures  
- DNS-level access interference  
- Strategic silencing measures  
- Mass removal of online records
