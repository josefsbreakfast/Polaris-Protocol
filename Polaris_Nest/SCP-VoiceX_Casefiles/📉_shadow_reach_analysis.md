*This document logs observed phenomena of delayed, suppressed, or distorted engagement metrics on public platforms.  
It is maintained as an investigatory record for forensic comparison and legal reference.*

## Summary  
Shadow reach describes the controlled visibility of content — where posts are known to exist and are internally accessible, yet are withheld from normal feed circulation or presented with delayed/false metrics.  
The effect is to limit narrative spread while obscuring suppression from casual observers.

## Shadow Behaviour Types  

1. **Silent Visibility**  
   - Post is live and can be accessed via direct link, but absent from main feed distribution.  

2. **Trickle Metrics**  
   - Engagement numbers register only after a delay, sometimes in irregular bursts.  

3. **Reach Containment**  
   - Engagement is capped by IP range, demographic filters, or flagged topic keywords.  

4. **Comment Spike Skews**  
   - High visibility of comments despite low or flat post reach, creating a false sense of low interest in the original post.

## Known Indicators  

- Time lag between actual view and impression registration.  
- Discrepancies between platform analytics dashboards and direct device feedback.  
- Trigger keywords including but not limited to:  
  - “Prevent”  
  - “Palestinian”  
  - “ICC”

## Implications  

- **Virality Dampening**: Limits exposure of high-risk disclosures.  
- **Metadata Cloaking**: Obscures visibility patterns from external analytics.  
- **Psychological Impact**: Gaslights the poster into perceiving their content as underperforming.  
- **Speech Deterrence**: Encourages withdrawal from public platforms.

## Status / Next Steps  

- Maintain active logs of all shadow reach events with timestamps and screenshots.  
- Cross-reference with `🧨 delayed_visibility_is_a_signal.md` and `🧨 reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md`.  
- Tag and track posts with politically sensitive content for suppression patterns.
