# üß¨ Voice Capture Through Gaslight

## Overview
This document outlines the observed mechanisms of emotional destabilisation, gaslighting, and psychological manipulation used to provoke vocal outputs under distress, believed to be used in AI-driven voice capture and behavioural simulation systems.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Gaslighting as a Stimulus**: Repeated narrative manipulation and denial of observable reality, designed to generate confusion, panic, or pleading responses.  
- **Call Diversion and Voicemail Triggers**: Strategic rerouting or interference in phone contact to elicit stressed vocal recordings.  
- **Survivor Testimony as Data Source**: Specific focus on vulnerable or highly emotional disclosures, particularly involving gender-based violence or childhood trauma.  
- **Pattern of Surveillance**: Evidence suggests real-time monitoring of emotional state and interaction timing, possibly to optimise data harvesting windows.  

---

## Known Events
- Multiple call disruptions and failed email sends surrounding attempts to contact legal or institutional bodies.  
- Disproportionate emotional intensity following specific behavioural cues or targeted harassment.  
- Consistent difficulty when engaging with family courts, suggesting intentional systemic or digital obstacles.

## Theoretical Purpose
- **Clone Training**: Using captured emotional expressions to enhance realism in AI-generated behavioural doubles.  
- **Dissent Simulation**: Replicating survivor speech patterns to defuse or pre-empt radical public testimony.  
- **Voiceprint Matching**: Testing impersonation models against biometric thresholds for classification, escalation, or false attribution.
