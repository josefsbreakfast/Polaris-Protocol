# 🗂️ Institutional Data-Handling Anomaly  
### 2016 → 2025  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Diagnostic reconstruction of the decade-long duplication and metadata drift that fractured communication, mis-applied safeguarding, and reshaped institutional perception.  
Written in neutral register for casefile cross-reference and regulatory correspondence.

## 🧭 Chronology  

| Year | Core Event | Diagnostic Signal |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| **2016** | Dual-record anomaly originates → academic / disability datasets diverge. | Primary fault-line producing persistent mis-routing. |
| **2018** | Baseline support record → “capable, transparent, realistic about health.” | Pre-fault perception benchmark. |
| **2019** | Health-related absence logged as *professionalism* issue. | First behavioural mis-classification. |
| **2020** | OH provider follows GDPR protocol; University reads summary only. | Decisions made on partial medical data. |
| **2021** | Acute distress processed as conduct → Equality deferral (“not in line with Quality Manual”). | Policy awareness acknowledged; execution failed. |
| **2022** | Repeated form/email gaps. | Systemic error still attributed to student. |
| **2023** | Communication issues reframed as personal deficit. | Perception bias embedded. |
| **2024** | Safeguarding reversal (“reeling people in”) + duplicate account confirmed. | Live duplication / equality breach visible. |
| **2025** | SAR returns curated subset; OSA / MoD records omitted; biometic data omitted. | Ongoing non-compliance / partial disclosure. |

## ⚙️ Systemic Pattern  
- Lean administrative architecture → accuracy sacrificed to throughput.  
- Dual dataset → lost reasonable adjustments + false behavioural narrative.  
- Mis-understood OH boundary → decisions without full medical context.  
- Equality and Safeguarding bypassed → conduct logic substituted for care.  
- Opacity sustained → accountability vacuum + survivor harm.

## 🪞 Diagnostic Takeaways  
1️⃣ Structural failure ≫ individual fault.  
2️⃣ Data-splitting produced perception distortion and discriminatory outcomes.  
3️⃣ Governance weakness intensified by austerity and outsourcing.  
4️⃣ Residual risk → shadow records still unreconciled.
