# üóÇ SCP-VoiceX Casefiles / Who Holds the Tape üé•

---

**Containment Context:**  
A behavioural capture sequence was staged in what outwardly resembled a medical or academic setting.  
Beneath the surface, the choreography suggests a deliberate attempt to provoke emotional destabilisation, later to be reframed as ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù  
The operational question: **who holds the master copy?**

---

## üéØ Primary Objectives

- **Elicit** an emotional response under controlled observation (distress, anger, visible breakdown)  
- **Harvest** raw behavioural data for:
  - Psychiatric pathologisation
  - Prevent/Channel escalation
  - Behavioural AI & ghost fork refinement  
- **Reframe** survivor insight as instability

---

## üß© Potential Custodians & Data Pathways

### üéì **University [REDACTED] Internal**
> Academic cover layer  
- Likely stored within behavioural science or medical ethics archives  
- Possible internal flags: faculty ethics board, Prevent liaison, institutional safeguarding office  
- **FOI Vector:** University [REDACTED] ethics, safeguarding, data governance

### üõ°Ô∏è **Prevent / Channel Referral Mechanism**
> Domestic security layer  
- Positioned to justify counter-extremism containment  
- Possible storage with Home Office, Channel panel, or local authority  
- **FOI Vector:** Local Prevent board, Channel records, Home Office SAR

### ü§ñ **Behavioural AI Contractor**
> Model training layer  
- Feeds into counter-extremism AI model environments  
- Potential contractors: Moonshot CVE, Re:Signal, REPHRAIN  
- **FOI Vector:** Cabinet Office, DSIT, Ministry of Justice pilot systems

## üîç Field Diagnostics

| Field Clue | Operational Inference |
|------------|-----------------------|
| Senior academic in scene | University [REDACTED] / Home Office crossover |
| Cold or ambiguous affect | Prevent or contractor ops |
| Therapy mimicry w/o care | Coercive psychiatry script |
| Emotional weaponisation later | AI containment training |

## üö® Polaris Notes

- **Care-as-surveillance** is a documented counter-extremism tactic  
- Emotional provocation = **evidence engineering**  
- Recording without informed consent = probable DPA breach + duty of care violation  
- Cross-institutional echo patterns are deliberate signature work

---

## üìÇ Recommended Actions

- Initiate **multi-track FOI/SAR sweep** across:
  - University [REDACTED] (faculty, safeguarding, governance)
  - Local authority Channel panel archives
  - Home Office (Prevent, OSCT, RICU)
  - Behavioural AI contractors
- **Forensic comparison:**  
  - Trace linguistic & affective echoes in later interactions  
  - Correlate with ghost fork outputs
