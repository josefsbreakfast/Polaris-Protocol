**Subject:** Safety and Transparency  

Hello [redacted publisher] team,  

Thank you for your continued programme of events for the wider community.  

I attended the Norm Finkelstein talk last year and found it both professional and valuable.  

I am writing with a note that may seem unusual, but for reasons of safety and transparency I feel it important to share. I have potentially experienced data fraud in which my attendance at different events was misused to construct false claims against others. As a Jewish woman, this has appeared to target Muslim men in particular.  

I am in the process of sourcing legal representation. In the meantime, I want to make clear that I am aware of these issues and have already provided two statements of truth to prevent any misuse of my name against others. I understand that, given the way this has been handled, direct approaches to me may not feel safe for those potentially affected.  

I will also be discussing this matter with trusted contacts in the coming weeks, beginning tomorrow in London.  

I wish you every continued success in your work, and would like to emphasise again that my experience of your events has been thoroughly professional and positive.  

With best regards,  
[Your name]

## Further Context (Internal Archive Only)  

- Subject Access Requests (SARs) made under the **Freedom of Information Act** remain outstanding, including to the **Home Office**, with the potential to clarify matters relating to arrest records.  
- Additional SARs and FOIs have been submitted to other institutions and organisations, which may together provide a fuller picture of how this misuse was carried out.  
- I am aware that **AI-based vocal smoothing tools** may have been involved, and that my data may have been used in **research and development contexts** without consent.  
- I am pursuing these issues as best as I can from a data rights perspective. However, without secure legal representation — which is difficult to obtain and beyond my current funding capacity — my ability to press further is limited.  
- This is therefore framed as a **pre-emptive signal**: I am willing to continue pursuing these matters, but it will require external support to do so effectively.
