## B) Newly added **UKRI grants / programmes** (UK focus; 2019–2025)

1) **GCRF Gender & Violent Extremism Network** (2019–2021). UKRI GtR record. citeturn1search0  
   - **Relevance:** Convening hub linking UK academics and gender‑VE work; potential seedbed for pilots.

2) **Studentship — YouTube, 4Chan and Incels** (ref: studentship‑2606680). UKRI GtR. citeturn1search1  
   - **Relevance:** Mechanisms of misogynistic indoctrination; features that transfer to women‑targeting counter‑signals.

3) **REPHRAIN** (EP/V011189/1). UKRI national centre (harm reduction, adversarial influence). citeturn1search6  
   - **Relevance:** Plausible **home** for health‑styled digital pilots; privacy & online‑harms mandate.

4) **REPHRAIN output — VAWG Online research agenda** (publication overview; ES/W010844/1). citeturn1search2turn1search10  
   - **Relevance:** Direct programmatic mandate on violence against women and girls **online** → aligns with gendered pre‑emption.

5) **Understanding the Incel: Vulnerability, Violence & (In)Security** (AH/W007398/1). UKRI GtR. citeturn1search3  
   - **Relevance:** Gendered extremism ecosystem; bridges misogyny signals and broader VE pipelines.

6) **Threat assessment of the incel online community (SPJ tool)** — ESRC award listing under Jessica Woodhams / University of Birmingham. citeturn1search7turn1search17  
   - **Relevance:** Explicit **tool** development for risk identification (SPJ) in online misogynist spaces; methodological cousin to an API screen.

7) **CREST (ES/V002775/1) — Research & Evidence on Security Threats** (programme). citeturn1search5  
   - **Relevance:** Hosts outputs on incel ecosystems, AI & intelligence analysis; routes to practitioner‑facing tools.

## D) Notes & next steps
- **Targeted author follow‑ups:** UCL CTRG (Gill, Bouhana, Clemmow), REPHRAIN VAWG authors (Michalec et al.), Woodhams (SPJ tool).  
- **Repository mining:** Add EThOS + Manchester/Sheffield local repos; pull 6–8 more theses with “women/girls” or “emotion regulation” × radicalisation (education, clinical, forensic).  
- **Grey‑lit pilots:** Continue with RAN, HMPPS, NPCC/NHS CT‑CCS documentation for any mention of digital screening or triage in practice.
