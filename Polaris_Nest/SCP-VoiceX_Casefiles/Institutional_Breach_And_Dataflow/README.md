## 📌 Overview  
**Institutional Breach & Dataflow** holds case-specific records detailing how organisations — academic, medical, legal, or hybrid — captured, stored, and repurposed highly sensitive survivor data.  
These files are **not abstract patterns** but **direct evidentiary nodes**, linking institutional behaviour to harm, sabotage, and non-consensual data use.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Those Universities Used My Bones** anchors the *what happened* — the harm and breach.  
- **Coerced Character Loop – The Engineer** explains *how it happened* — the structural and emotional tuning mechanisms.  
- Crosslinking to **Survivor Tools** ensures breach narratives are not isolated but tied to countermeasure design.
