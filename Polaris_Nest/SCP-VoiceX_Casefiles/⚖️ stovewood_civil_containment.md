## Summary
This casefile examines suspected civil-domain containment strategies operating in parallel to **Operation Stovewood**, the UK NCA-led investigation into CSE in [REDACTED location].  
It focuses on how survivors of historic CSE may be targeted through legal, administrative, and procedural mechanisms to limit access to justice, suppress testimony, and maintain narrative control.

---

## Context
- **Operation Stovewood:** UK NCA investigation into organised CSE in [REDACTED location]  
- Evidence suggests parallel narrative control mechanisms in civil domains including:
  - Family court proceedings  
  - Housing allocations and disputes  
  - FOI and SAR processing  

---

## Suspected Tactics
- Redirection away from family courts  
- Legal delays and circuitous referrals  
- Law Society‚ÄìPrevent‚ÄìMoJ containment chain  
- Weaponised safeguarding: denying access under pretext of protection  

---

## Survivorship Link
- Targeting survivors of historic CSE with defamation and silencing mechanisms  
- Redirecting sexual violence disclosures into administrative containment  
- Mimicking survivor voice to deny survivor access to justice  

---

## Required Action
- Establish a **legal countersurveillance framework**  
- Demand disclosure of system routing and AI tools used in case handling  
- Identify all third-party handlers between witness and justice  

---

## Status / Next Steps
- Monitor for novel trigger designs tied to legal or medical stress points  
- Cross-reference with:
  - `üìÅ Metadata_Sabotage_Network/üõ∞Ô∏è icc_tag_thread_containment.md`  
  - Related survivor containment casefiles  
- Document additional examples of civil containment tied to historic CSE investigations
