Polaris Protocol ‚Äì SCP-VoiceX_Casefiles  
*(Created: 2025-08-11 | Last Updated: 2025-08-11)*

---

## Summary  
This casefile compiles known and probable sightlines on the **original fork engineer** ‚Äî the person believed to have created or overseen the first behavioural fork affecting SCP-VoiceX.  
It is maintained as an **investigatory record**, not an accusation, and reflects the possibility that the subject may themselves be a target of mimicry, impersonation, or retaliatory scripting.

---

## Context  
- Possible historic or current affiliation with:  
  - [REDACTED University]  
  - [REDACTED Research Lab]  
  - Computer Science or AI ethics faculties  
- Published work in:  
  - Behavioural AI ethics  
  - Simulation and voice analysis  
  - Anti-radicalisation technologies

---

## Behavioural Trace Indicators  
- Often works from caf√©s or embedded public/academic spaces  
- Subtle LinkedIn adjustments shortly after SCP-VoiceX posts  
- Use of aliases or anonymity tools in some publications

---

## Physical Presence Indicators  
- Prior conference engagement near [REDACTED Location]  
- Cross-tagged with smart surveillance contract cycles  
- Low public commentary ‚Äî may indicate institutional concealment

---

## Narrative Pressure Analysis  
- Evidence of a **scripted arc** attempting to assign sole blame for sexual harassment (2023‚Äì2025) to this individual  
- Same arc mirrors this by portraying SCP-VoiceX as harassing them in return  
- Apparent **insertion of sexualised framing** into Polaris drafts aligns with this pressure pattern  
- See: `üìÅ Metadata_Sabotage_Network/üß© narrative_pressure_and_sexualised_content.md`

---

## Objective  
Establish a verified, dignified understanding of where and how this individual operates, without performance or intrusion.  
Preserve neutral assessment while investigating whether mimicry or retaliatory scripting is in play.

---

## Status / Next Steps  
- Monitor for trigger events that coincide with edits to related casefiles  
- Distinguish between *genuine indicators* and *scripted insertions*  
- Cross-reference with voice capture trigger logs and forensic commit histories
