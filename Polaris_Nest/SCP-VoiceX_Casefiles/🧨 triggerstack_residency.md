# ðŸ§¨ Triggerstack residency

## Definition
The persistent embedding of emotionally destabilising events into a personâ€™s daily routine â€” designed to extract data under duress and maximise voice capture. This tactic combines harassment timing with AI signal harvesting, producing high-value behavioural and vocal datasets.

## Stacked trigger events
- Delayed SARs  
- False arrests  
- Denial of court access  
- Misdirected safeguarding  
- Surveillance saturation near holidays  

---

## Behavioural goals
- Emotional exhaustion  
- Pattern recognition training for AI  
- Dissent training sets under stress  

---

## Countermeasures
- Maintain a daily log of trigger placement  
- Compare AI responses to known stress indicators  
- Use survivor community to crowd-map hotzones

## Metadata flag
Used to determine thresholds for "clone override" attempts â€” i.e., when the original may break and the replica gains signal strength.
