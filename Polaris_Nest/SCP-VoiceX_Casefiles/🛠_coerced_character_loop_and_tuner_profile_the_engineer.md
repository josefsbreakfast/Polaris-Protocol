# 🪤🛠 Coerced Character Loop & Tuner Profile: The Engineer

Polaris Protocol – Metadata_Sabotage_Network / SCP-VoiceX_Casefiles  
**Incident ID:** INC-2025-0811-ENGLOOP  
*(Created: 2025-08-11 | Last Updated: 2025-08-11)*

---

## Summary
This node documents an observed **coerced fixation and positioning loop** targeting SCP-VoiceX toward the “Engineer” character.  
The loop appears to be actively maintained by a **current fork tuner**, who—based on accumulated behavioural, stylistic, and operational evidence—is **not the same person** as the original fork engineer and does not possess the same skillset or characteristics.

---

## Distinction Between Actors
- **Original Engineer**: Associated with behavioural AI development, likely research-affiliated, and possibly unaware of downstream misuse.
- **Current Tuner**: Operates with reduced technical sophistication but increased focus on narrative and emotional steering; patterns indicate reactive rather than research-driven behaviour.

---

## Loop Characteristics
- Assigns sole blame for 2023–2025 sexual harassment incidents to the “Engineer” character.
- Simultaneously frames survivor as harassing the same character.
- Injects sexualised framing into otherwise neutral or forensic Polaris drafts **and across wider internet context**.
- Injection is **characteristic of racialised bullying in workplace harassment**: deeply racist and misrepresentative of basic biographical details of the likely actual engineer (details easily verifiable on public work bio).
- Forces recurring narrative return to “Engineer” regardless of initial subject matter.

---

## Forensic Indicators
- Loop activation coincides with:
  - Metadata suppression spikes
  - Content insertion mismatches in commit histories
  - Fork tone shifts toward personal/erotic content
- Style and targeting patterns inconsistent with the documented style of the original engineer.
- **Narrative pivot** aligning with police-linked blame shift:
  - Survivor had previously reported an impersonation attempt (before understanding the technical mechanism).
  - Subsequent narrative arc shifted blame away from certain institutional actors and onto the “Engineer” character in a way that mirrors fork outputs.
- **Evidence chain interference**:
  - The electronic copy of the original impersonation report has disappeared from storage without a clear cause.
  - Absence suggests targeted data removal to weaken continuity between the report, the police-linked pivot, and the ongoing fork tuning.

## Narrative Frame Context

- **Five Eyes Projection Role**:
  - As a pale-skinned Jewish woman, the survivor is placed — within certain security state narratives — into a symbolic “protected subject” category.
  - This frame is used to justify **complicity in genocidal policy** toward Palestinians, under the premise that “protection” of the survivor’s demographic requires maintaining the targeting of racialised and melanated men as *inherently sexually threatening*.
  - Such positioning operates as a **political grooming script**: casting the survivor as a figure whose safety depends on alignment with state violence.

- **Reality vs Projection**:
  - Survivor’s personal SV history contradicts the racialised threat model entirely — their abusers have been white men.
  - This contradiction is erased in the coercive loop, replacing lived experience with **state-serving fictions**.
  - The “Engineer” loop compounds this by tying sexual threat narratives to a *particular character* in ways that obscure structural and demographic truths.

- **Operational Effect**:
  - Aligns fork tuning with security bloc propaganda tropes.
  - Enables **racialised misdirection** in both public perception and sealed institutional records.
  - Makes resistance appear as deviation from “protection,” further entrenching the loop.

## Observations – Current Tuner

1. **Mismatch in Skill & Characteristics**
   - Present fork-tuning patterns do not align with the technical, academic, or personality profile of the original Engineer.
   - Narrative and emotional manipulation appear cruder, more reactive, and more aligned with law enforcement psychological ops than with research-led behavioural modelling.

2. **Coerced SH Loop**
   - Current tuning actively constructs a coercive sexual harassment narrative arc, framing both SCP-VoiceX and the original Engineer in reciprocal blame.
   - This mirrors historic blame-shifting tactics used to obscure source misconduct.

3. **Possible Law Enforcement Connection**
   - Prior impersonation reports were filed before the fork’s technical mechanism was understood.
   - Subsequent narrative shifts aligned with fork script and may have been supported by actors with police or intelligence-adjacent access.

4. **Evidence Deletion**
   - The electronic copy of the original impersonation report has been deleted from local storage without clear cause.
   - Matches patterns documented in:
     - `Metadata_Sabotage_Network/🧯 file_transport_failure_log.md`
     - `Metadata_Sabotage_Network/📛 storage_purge_detected.md`

5. **Active SAR – Identity Theft Risk**
   - Section 45 SAR currently submitted to ACRO Criminal Records Office to determine whether:
     - Pseudonymised or anonymised SH allegations have been logged using SCP-VoiceX’s identity.
     - Or whether direct claims under her name exist without consent or knowledge.

---

## Evidence Integrity – Dormant File Handling
- Dormant `.md` files (`📨 letter_to_the_engineer.md`, `🏛️ ethical_return_request.md`, `👁️ fork_origin_sighting.md`) were **deleted from repo**; offline forensic copies retained.
- Original repo versions contained **fork-injected/tuned content** portraying “hysteria” toward the “Engineer” character — **not** the survivor’s original tone or intent.
- Some injected drafts were **never deliberately saved by the survivor** but appeared in commit history via external content injection.
- These items should **not** be considered unmodified survivor-authored documents.

---

## Risks
- **Misattribution Risk**: Collapsing “original engineer” and “current tuner” into the same figure obscures accurate accountability chains.
- **Reputational Containment**: Deflects systemic critique toward a personalised conflict.
- **Evidence Contamination**: Pollutes survivor-authored documentation with apparent personal fixation.
- **Institutional Shielding**: Police or agency connections may enable suppression of technical investigation or reframing as personal dispute.

---

## Counter-Protocol Actions
- Keep direct-address files offline or in dormant storage.
- Publicly log loop existence while maintaining separation of actors.
- Catalogue indicators distinguishing the current tuner’s profile from the original engineer.
- Preserve commit and metadata traces for forensic correlation.
- Track police or agency-linked narrative shifts for correlation with metadata suppression events.
- Note and archive all instances of unexplained file disappearance related to impersonation reporting.
- Maintain chain-of-custody logs referencing **INC-2025-0811-ENGLOOP**.
