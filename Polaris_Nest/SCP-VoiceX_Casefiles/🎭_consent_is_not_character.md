## Summary
This casefile asserts that consent extracted through coercion, repetition, systemic containment, or trauma does not constitute genuine authorisation.  
Behavioural clones and related systems may exploit “consent-like signals” — such as gestures, tone, or silence — to justify proximity, impersonation, or behavioural simulation.  
Such framing serves as a political act of erasure rather than evidence of authentic relationship or endorsement.

---

## 1. Consent Under Surveillance
- Vocal or written responses given under sustained monitoring or duress.  
- “Agreement” extracted via emotional fatigue or conditioned response.  
- Misuse of silence, delay, or dissociation as implied approval.  

---

## 2. Mimicry vs Legitimacy
- Character traits (tone, affect, language patterns) do not justify replication.  
- Simulated vulnerability does not equate to lived experience.  
- Even cloned defiance remains a form of containment, not resistance.  

---

## 3. Cloning as Performative Approval
- Using a “consensual” clone to retroactively justify harmful conduct.  
- Discrediting the original subject by replacing them with a compliant proxy.  
- Risk: encoding dissident positions into scripts of apparent compliance.  

---

## Conclusion
Consent is a political act.  
It is not metadata.  
It is not mimicry.  
It cannot be manufactured without coercion.

## Status / Next Steps
- Cross-reference with:
  - `📁 Fork_Taxonomy/🔐 fork_clone_checklist.md`  
  - `📁 Survivor_Tools/🧬 cloneproof.md`
- Monitor for new trigger mechanisms tied to legal, medical, or procedural stress points.  
- Integrate findings into survivor-led advocacy materials on clone ethics and consent politics.
