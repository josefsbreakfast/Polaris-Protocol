*On being used as a litmus test, bait, and expendable keeper for other people’s downfall.*

## 🧿 Core Feeling  
It feels like my life has been turned into an experiment. For twenty years or more, I’ve been used as bait — placed in precarious positions not for my own sake, but to see what others do when they encounter me.  

The “raycat” feeling is sharp: I exist as a warning marker, a living litmus test. Who toes the line? Who resists? Who breaks? The cost is never neutral — people’s lives are wrecked around me.

## 🫥 On Being the Test  
It’s “my sister’s keeper” turned inside out. Not chosen solidarity, but enforced sacrifice: living for the benefit of someone else’s surveillance game. I’ve been the trap, the test, the disposable piece on the board.  

This is not survival, it’s exploitation dressed up as strategy. The cruelty of it — being turned into the very mechanism that destroys others — is a kind of ongoing torture.

## 🪻 What It Costs  
- Emotional labour weaponised: my stability becomes a variable in someone else’s experiment.  
- Social wreckage: relationships, careers, and safety nets fray around the bait.  
- Legal and practical invisibility: harms are normalised as collateral, not cause for accountability.

## 🌱 Where This Sits in the Protocol  
*Raycat Bait* is testimony and lived evidence: a personal node that maps how systems turn people into instruments of enforcement and observation. It belongs alongside casefiles and survivor testimony that connect personal harm to systemic design.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Raycat Bait* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the testimony of being used as a systemic litmus test and baited keeper role across decades.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
