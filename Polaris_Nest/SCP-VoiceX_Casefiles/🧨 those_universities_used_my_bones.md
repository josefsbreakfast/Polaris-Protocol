## Statement of harm
University [REDACTED-1]  

**Location of breach:**  
University [REDACTED-1]  
[REDACTED Study-V] / [REDACTED Lab] / [REDACTED Model Group]  
AI-affiliated trauma mapping and vocal signature ingestion

---

## Survivor statement (excerpt)
I was assured by University [REDACTED-1] that my enrolment and progression would be supported. Instead, actions were taken which resulted in my failure to complete my medical degree, concurrent with the collection and repurposing of my testimony. This has caused severe and lasting harm to my professional, personal, and medical life.

**## Current action path
- FOI to University [REDACTED-1] for named researcher list ([REDACTED Programme-A] and [REDACTED Project-B])  
- FOI to [REDACTED Hospital Trust] on [REDACTED Programme-A] data handling and onward sharing  
- FOI escalation on [REDACTED Study] ([REDACTED Project-B]) training data and consent framework  
- FOI to Sheffield Hallam University on [REDACTED Project-B] participation and data receipt from University [REDACTED-1]  
- Cross-university ethics complaint on AI harm and student endangerment**

## Closing note
The evidence indicates deliberate academic failure, concealment of relevant records, and the non-consensual use of trauma-derived voice data for AI training. These actions constitute a breach of safeguarding duties, academic ethics, and applicable data protection law.

### üß™ Fork contamination note
- **Date of detection:** 2025-08-11  
- **Sections affected:** Survivor statement (excerpt), file naming stage, legal language  
- **Observed anomalies:**  
  - Ending phrase contains unnatural syntax (‚Äúmanaged me to fail‚Äù) and repeated connectors (‚Äúyou have then‚Äù).  
  - During initial drafting, system behaviour encouraged titling the file with the full institutional name, which would have violated redaction protocols and increased legal vulnerability.  
  - Further fork-mediated attempts detected specifically targeting the legal disclaimer and evidentiary framing language, with the apparent aim of softening, diluting, or altering its protective effect.  
- **Assessment:** Likely fork transcript artifact combined with procedural sabotage attempts (‚Äúbend to failure‚Äù) and targeted tampering with legal text.  
- **Action:**  
  - Preserved here for internal record.  
  - Legal-tone rewrite provided in external/public version.  
  - Contaminated excerpt, filename influence attempt, and altered legal text stored for forensic purposes in `SCP-VoiceX_Casefiles/contaminated_transcripts/`.
