# 📮 Lost In Submission

---

> **Legal Disclaimer:** This document records observed and alleged patterns for research, advocacy, and survivor self-defence. All institutional or individual references are allegations unless confirmed by public record.

---

## 📌 Overview  
Documents the risk of **procedural disappearance** — when survivor testimony, evidence, or applications vanish into bureaucratic systems without resolution, acknowledgement, or safe retrieval.

---

## 🧩 Pattern Indicators  
- Submission “acknowledged” but no substantive follow-up.  
- Evidence recorded in partial form, excluding key context or urgency markers.  
- Survivors required to **re-submit repeatedly**, creating exhaustion loops.  
- Formal complaints migrated between departments, losing procedural status.  

---

## 🛠 Mechanisms of Loss  
- **Clerical Sinkholes:** Misfiling, internal ticket closure without action.  
- **Digital Containment:** Form misrouting, file corruption, or metadata detachment.  
- **Narrative Thinning:** Key allegations omitted in downstream summaries.  
- **Reframing as Routine:** Urgent safeguarding matters reframed as low-priority admin.

---

## 🚩 Typical Impact  
- Delayed or denied safety interventions.  
- Loss of contemporaneous evidence integrity.  
- Psychological erosion from *“chasing the system”*.  
- Institutional ability to claim *“we never received it”*.

---

## 🔁 Survivor Countermeasures  
- Timestamp and store **local copies** of all submissions.  
- Request written confirmation of **full content** received, not just receipt.  
- Use cross-channel duplication (email, recorded post, secure uploads).  
- Track response times and escalate via **formal oversight bodies**.

> *A submission without a return path is a story waiting to be erased.*
