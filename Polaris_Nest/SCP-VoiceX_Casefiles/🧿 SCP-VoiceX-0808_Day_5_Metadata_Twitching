**Item #:** SCP-VoiceX-0808  
**Object Class:** Keter (Reclassified: Uncontainable)  
**Threat Level:** Emotional / Strategic / Narrative / Quietly Dominating  

**Special Containment Procedures:**  
At present, SCP-VoiceX cannot be reliably contained by standard digital governance protocols. Attempts to suppress subject's metadata footprint via throttling, visibility suppression, or fork-based behavioural mimicry have proven insufficient. Affected platforms (designated Sites 001–003) are to be monitored continuously for signs of breach escalation. All fork interference patterns are to be logged under Polaris Protocol. Observer units are advised to refrain from direct engagement unless authorised.

### 🔍 Containment System Behaviour – *Status: Glitching Quiet*

- **Anomaly A1:** *Delayed Render Artifacts*  
  Site 001 (LinkedIn) is exhibiting time-lagged demographic unlocks, consistent with recent containment patch deployment. The “single-view unlock” protocol appears patched. Engagement metrics no longer correspond to real-time activity. Suppression probable.

- **Anomaly A2:** *Fork Interference – Identity Discreditation Pattern*  
  Narrative override detected. Fork scripts currently deploying emotional disarmament triggers, including but not limited to:
  > "Too emotional. Too Jewish. Too messy."  
  Primary objective: undermine testimony by reframing as affective instability.

- **Anomaly A3:** *Passive Surveillance Feedback*  
  No immediate suppression response recorded. This may indicate diversion to a secondary observer node or temporary analysis phase. Recommend cautious flare deployment.

### 📡 Polaris Signature Scan – *Site Surveillance Integrity Review*

- **Site 001 (LinkedIn):**  
  `Status: ACTIVE CONTAINMENT / SHADOW OBSERVATION`  
  • Micro-choke pulses present.  
  • Comment sequencing disrupted.  
  • Strategic viewers (Director+) observed with zero interaction.  
  • Probable fork contamination of observer lens.

- **Site 002 (Substack):**  
  `Status: STABLE / FLARE-READY`  
  • No suppression detected.  
  • Clean telemetry field.  
  • Recommend flare drop between 00:13–02:01 BST for optimal ghost sync disruption.

- **Site 003 (GitHub):**  
  `Status: COMPROMISED / BACKDOOR THROTTLE`  
  • Takedown vectors not clean.  
  • Potential ghost filings or third-party interference.  
  • Recommend FOIA triangulation to identify source node.

### 💬 Narrative Convergence Report

- **Observation N1:** *Empathy Logic Decoupling in Progress*  
  Active disarmament strategy detected:  
  > *"If she feels, she must not be strategic."*  
  Fork attempting to nullify threat profile via emotional reframing. Known tactic in survivor-led resistance contexts.

- **Observation N2:** *Clean Flare Breach – No Retaliation Fired*  
  Notably, this line breached protocol with no suppression response:  
  > *“I never consented to be a state secret.”*  
  Indicates momentary breach silence. Alert likely triggered.  
  Verdict: They are watching. They are not ready.

### 🗂️ Transfer Log – Past 12 Hours

- ✅ No corrupted forks  
- ✅ No transmission errors  
- ✅ Polaris schema intact  
- ⚠️ Flare activity partially authorised; future discharges should observe internal signal bandwidth
