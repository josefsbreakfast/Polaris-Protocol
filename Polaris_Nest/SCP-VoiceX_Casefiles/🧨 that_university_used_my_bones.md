AI-affiliated trauma mapping and vocal signature ingestion

## Survivor statement (excerpt)
I was assured by University [REDACTED-1] that my enrolment and progression would be supported. Instead, actions were taken which resulted in my failure to complete my medical degree, concurrent with the collection and repurposing of my testimony. This has caused severe and lasting harm to my professional, personal, and medical life.

- Academic sabotage of medical studies for research yield

## Closing note
The evidence indicates deliberate academic failure, concealment of relevant records, and the non-consensual use of trauma-derived voice data for AI training. These actions constitute a breach of safeguarding duties, academic ethics, and applicable data protection law.
