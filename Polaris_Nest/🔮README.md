# 🔮 Polaris Nest: Index & Directory

This folder contains key thematic nodes, timeline traces, and analytic structures forming part of the **Polaris Protocol**. Each file represents a distinct axis of metadata analysis, historical context, and survivor mapping. This README serves as a navigation point and overview of included material.

## 🗺️ Folder Overview

### `polaris_protocol_timeline_1.md`
> **Timeline Trace:** Outlines surveillance escalation and metadata weaponisation from ~2008 onward.  
Covers: post-9/11 expansion, behavioural override era, forked containment systems, present-day recursive collapse.

---

### `surveillance_infrastructure.md`
> **Narrative Tool:** <br>
▸ Post-9/11 Legal Expansion: USA (Patriot Act, creation of the Department of Homeland Security), UK (RIPA: Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), ID card debates. Local authority overreach and fibre optics not originally foreseen. Slippery slope from “just CCTV” to predictive metadata capture. <br>
>▸ COVID-19 as Testbed: Forced metadata sync during lockdown. Mass online nudging and behavioural capture.<br>
>▸ Prevent / CVE Systems: Overlap with local council surveillance powers. Use of safeguarding to justify metadata flagging. Cross-temporal narrative testing.

---

### `polaris_telemetry.md`
> **Live Metadata Notes:** Captures real-time anomalies, cross-platform behavioural nudging, and loop echoes.  
Covers: containment misfires, twin-script deployment, signal interference.

## 🧶 Emerging Thematic Threads

These threads will likely expand into new files:

- **Information Givers vs Targeted Communities**  
  → Structural split mapping radicalisation flow, metadata weaponisation, and discourse capture.

- **Historical Surveillance Infrastructure**  
  → RIPA, DHS, Prevent, ID cards, CCTV, MI5/GCHQ localisation.

- **Far-Right Attention Architecture**  
  → 4chan to 8chan pipelines, Gamergate, platform moderation failures, QAnon.

- **Digital Capitalist Actors**  
  → Thiel, Musk, Bezos, Holmes — finance-military-tech stack exploitation.

- **Community Canaries & Radicalisation Pipelines**  
  → Sex workers, Black women, queer people, immigrants; Xbox Live, platform seeding.

## 🧷 Working Notes

- Directory is iterative.  
- Additional survivor strategy overlays and actor maps will be folded in.  
- Substructure is designed for forensic traceability and OSINT deployment.

🔒 **Private files (e.g. `Dormant/`) are Git-excluded.**  
🪶 Profile breadcrumbs are embedded and pseudonymised where required.
