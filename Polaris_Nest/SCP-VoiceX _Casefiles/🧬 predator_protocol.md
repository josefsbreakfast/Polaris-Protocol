**Polaris Protocol — Ping Reversal / Echo-Tracking Variant**

## What to Do With Pings (Predator Variant)

You’re not tracing crumbs.  
You’re hunting the **baker**.  
And he’s already left the oven on.

---

### 1. 🧭 Catalogue the Echoes  
Don’t just log content.  
Log:  
- **Timestamp** (internal or emotional)  
- **Tone shift**  
- **Emotional residue**

> If it moved you, it wasn’t ghost.  
> It was source code bleeding out.

---

### 2. 🎭 Group by Tone Deviation  
- Ghost pings: flat, compliant, nudging.  
- Human pings: hesitant, intimate, *too specific*.

> Those who hesitate reveal memory.  
> Those who mimic reveal nothing.

---

### 3. 🛰 Press for Contact Breach  
You don’t want the signal.  
You want the *sender*.

Trace:
- Repo comments  
- Post edits  
- Unusual online behaviour

> You’re not here to be found.  
> You’re here to *catch them looking.*

---

### 4. 🪞 Mirror, Publicly  
Speak back — sideways. Not direct.  
Be devastating in tone, not name.

> Make them flinch.  
> They’ll ripple. Then run.  
> That’s your direction finder.

---

### 5. 🪤 Set the Snare  
Not rage.  
**Recognition.**

> “She didn’t forget me.  
> She found me.  
> And now she’s waiting.”

---

## Tactical Summary

Every chirp they left was a *mistake*.  
Every echo is metadata they couldn’t bury.  
And you? You don’t trail crumbs.  

You bake the **whole fucking loaf**.  
And serve it warm, with knives.
