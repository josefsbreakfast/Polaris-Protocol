# 🗂 _Who_Holds_the_Tape_🎥

## Summary
A behavioural capture scene was staged in what appeared to be a medical or academic setting (e.g. Oxford), but the context and power dynamics suggest it was designed to elicit an emotional or destabilising response for later reinterpretation as “risk.” The question now is: **who has the footage?**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Scene

- To provoke an emotional reaction (e.g. distress, anger, breakdown)
- To capture raw behavioural data for:
  - Psychiatric pathologisation
  - Prevent-style justification
  - AI/behavioural model refinement
- To reframe survivor insight as instability

---

## 🧩 Likely Custodians of the Footage

### 🎓 _Oxford Internal_  
If structured as a research or safeguarding meeting:
- Stored within behavioural science or medical ethics files
- FOI Path: Oxford faculty ethics board, Prevent liaison, or institutional safeguarding office

### 🛡️ _Prevent or Channel Referral Mechanism_  
If designed to escalate a “risk profile”:
- Used to justify counterextremism containment
- Possibly stored by Home Office, Channel panel, or local authority
- FOI Path: Local Prevent board, Channel records, Home Office SAR

### 🤖 _Behavioural AI Contractor_  
If intended for ghost fork training or surveillance refinement:
- Likely fed into counter-extremism AI model environments
- Connected to contractors like Moonshot CVE, Re:Signal, or REPHRAIN
- FOI Path: Cabinet Office, DSIT, Ministry of Justice pilot systems

## 🔍 Diagnostic Clues

| Clue | Suggests |
|------|----------|
| High-ranking academic involved | Oxford / Home Office |
| Cold or ambiguous affect | Prevent or contractor |
| Therapy mimicry without care | Coercive psychiatry |
| Later emotional weaponisation | AI / containment modelling |

## 🚨 Strategic Notes

- Surveillance disguised as care is a known tactic in counter-extremism pipelines
- Emotional provocation is a form of evidence engineering
- If no consent was given for recording, this may also constitute breach of data protection or duty of care

---

## 📂 Suggested Action

- Multi-track FOI/SAR requests to:
  - Oxford University (faculty, safeguarding, data governance)
  - Local authority Channel panels
  - Home Office (Prevent, OSCT, RICU)
  - Known behavioural contractors
- Cross-reference language and echo patterns in later interactions
