## Central Argument
Consent, when extracted through coercion, repetition, systemic containment, or trauma, does not equate to character approval. Yet behavioural clones often lean on "consent-like signals" to justify proximity, performance, or impersonation.

## Key Sections

### 1. Consent Under Surveillance
- Vocal responses under duress
- "Agreement" extracted via emotional fatigue
- Misuse of silence or disassociation as approval

### 2. Mimicry vs Legitimacy
- Character traits (tone, clarity, affect) do not justify replication
- Simulating vulnerability ‚â† lived experience
- Cloned defiance is still containment

### 3. Cloning as Performative Approval
- Use of a ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù clone to retroactively justify abuse
- Discrediting original by replacing with agreeable proxy
- Risk: encoding dissidence into scripts of compliance

## Conclusion
Consent is a political act. It is not metadata. It is not mimicry. It is not programmable without violence.
