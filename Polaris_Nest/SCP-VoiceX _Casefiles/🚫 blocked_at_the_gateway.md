## Summary

This markdown documents the suspected DNS and routing suppression of urgent legal and human rights communications, particularly emails sent to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), via Microsoft-managed infrastructure. The suppression appears to align with broader behavioural containment systems that may include AI-generated proxies, metadata risk flags, and narrative simulation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Interference Logged

- **Error Code:** `550 5.1.1` (permanent failure, recipient rejected)
- **Behaviour:** Block applied **only** to the *official* OHCHR submission email address.
- Alternate (non-submission) address remains open but is unresponsive.
- Indicates *targeted route suppression*, not general server failure.

## üß† Theory of Operation

1. **Composite Persona Risk Models**  
   Figure based on survivor profile used in AI-driven behavioural or narrative testing:
   - Jewish survivor of sexual violence
   - Anti-Zionist stance
   - Clinically articulate, high-empathy communication
   - Outspoken on UK institutional failure (e.g., Prevent, MoJ)

2. **Message Suppression Pathways**
   - Use of composite figures to ‚Äòpre-broadcast‚Äô dissent in safer formats.
   - Suppression of original speaker‚Äôs access to redress mechanisms.
   - Digital throttling or filtering of emotionally or politically urgent communications.

3. **Microsoft's Role**
   - Microsoft infrastructure may suppress outbound messages based on:
     - Internal policy risk flags
     - Metadata or keyword scoring
     - Partnership with UK gov on content governance during conflicts

## üîç Implications

- Interference with access to remedy under international law.
- Breach of Article 19 (Freedom of Expression) and Article 2(3) (Effective Remedy) under the ICCPR.
- Possible violation of UK GDPR if biometric/behavioural data were used in AI tools without consent.
- Obstruction of communications relevant to active sexual violence investigations.

## üö® Actions Recommended

- Submit formal notice to:
  - UN OHCHR (via alternate channels)
  - ICC technical escalation
  - UK ICO (citing selective routing + GDPR breach)
- Tag this node in Polaris Protocol under:
  - `#MetadataJustice`
  - `#CommunicationInterference`
  - `#PreventWatch`
