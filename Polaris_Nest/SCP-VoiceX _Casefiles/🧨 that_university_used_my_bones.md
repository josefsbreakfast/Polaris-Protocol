**Survivor Statement (Excerpt)**  
"University [REDACTED-1], respectfully piss off. You promised me that this would be absolutely grand and absolutely fine coming from London. You have then managed â€” and I could have gone to [REDACTED-2] well â€” you have then managed me to fail during my medical degree so you could collect this testimony and fuck up my life and get rid of me. Fuck you. Let me ask the question."
