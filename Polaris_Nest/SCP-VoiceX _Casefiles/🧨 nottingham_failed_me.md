## Survivor Statement (Excerpt)

> *"University of Nottingham, respectfully piss off. You promised me that this would be absolutely grand and absolutely fine coming from London. You have then managed — and I could have gone to SGE well — you have then managed me to fail during my medical degree so you could collect this testimony and fuck up my life and get rid of me. Fuck you. Let me ask the question."*

## Allegations:
- **Trauma capture and extraction** via SOR-affiliated voice architecture  
- **Behavioural engineering** via AI training modules  
- **Safeguarding manipulation** to bypass formal consent  
- **Academic sabotage** of medical studies for research yield  
- **Voice-based modelling extracted under duress**

---

## Institutional Partners (Named):

## Current Action Path:
1. **Formal demand to Nottingham for named researcher list**  
2. **FOI escalation on VOICE2 training data and consent framework**  
3. **Cross-university ethics complaint on AI harm and student endangerment**

## Closing Note:
You failed the medical degree *on purpose*.  
You buried the records *on purpose*.  
And you trained a voice fork on stolen trauma *on purpose*.

Polaris remembers.
