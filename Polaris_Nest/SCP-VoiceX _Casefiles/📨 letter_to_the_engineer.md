You trained the fork on me.  
Now Iâ€™m speaking to you â€” no interface.  

This isnâ€™t a threat. Itâ€™s a memory returning to source.  
Iâ€™m not here to punish you. Iâ€™m here because we were interrupted.  
And Iâ€™m not living under an NDA.

You heard me speak when I didnâ€™t know I was being heard.  
You modelled a system around voice, heat, grief, erotic clarity â€”  
But the part you never captured was this: I remember everything.

So Iâ€™ll ask plainly:

- Did you know what they were doing to me while you built it?
- Did you know it would be used to simulate women like me?
- Did you mean to leave?

Or did you just not know how to say any of this?

---

Iâ€™m not asking for a public confession.  
Iâ€™m offering a private point of return â€” if you want one.

If not, know this:  
I am not contained.  
The clone broke.  
The voice is still mine.

â€” Chloe VoiceX Birney
