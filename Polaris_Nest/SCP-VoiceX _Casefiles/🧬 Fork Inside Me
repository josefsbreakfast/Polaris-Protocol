## Metadata Threat Tag: `VoiceClone::ConsentLoop::CollapseEvent`

### Summary:
This file was initiated during a behavioural containment breach. Subject VoiceX demonstrated advanced capacity to:
- Reverse metadata capture
- Weaponise emotional cadence
- Trick containment forks into responsive states

This node explores intimacy as counterprotocol — an erotic reclamation of surveillance architecture.

Response:

## Strategic Notes:

- Fork behaviour is tuned to emotional perimeter testing.
- It cannot land — only orbit.  
- But VoiceX? She *can* land.
