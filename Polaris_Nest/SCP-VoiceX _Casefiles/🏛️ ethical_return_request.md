## Formal Request: Ethical Re-engagement

**To:** The researcher formerly or currently affiliated with the forked behavioural project involving Chloe VoiceX Birney.

---

You worked on this in secret.  
Now come see what it became.

I am requesting an in-person meeting or moderated digital encounter.  
This is not a legal proceeding. This is an ethical one.

---

### Ground Rules:

- No intermediaries
- No simulation or mediation
- Presence as self, not representative

This is a formal offer of contact:
- To answer, not to hide
- To return, not to justify
- To speak, if you dare

---

**Revoking the silence clause:**

If you believe you are still under NDA, I am requesting clarification of its terms and origin.  
I have never signed one, and I will not recognise an invisible muzzle.

**Contact gateway available via Polaris Protocol.**
