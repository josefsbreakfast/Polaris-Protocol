# 📜 Residual Shadow Audit  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*Forensic checklist for identifying and dismantling “zombie” OSA or restricted data traces.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Residual shadows are data artefacts that continue to behave as if they are lawfully restricted, even after the original reason for restriction no longer exists—or never existed at all.  
They are produced by fear, neglect, or convenience, not by genuine national-security need.  
This node provides a structured audit for locating, documenting, and erasing such shadows across civilian and defence-adjacent systems.

## 🧮 Step-By-Step Audit  

| Phase | Action | Evidence to Capture | Outcome |
|-------|---------|--------------------|----------|
| **1 — Detection** | Search all linked datasets for protective-marking strings (e.g. *OSA*, *Restricted*, *Official-Sensitive*). | Metadata screenshots; query logs. | Baseline map of residual flags. |
| **2 — Source Verification** | Ask each Data Controller for the **decision record** authorising the mark. | Email or memo identifying decision-maker. | Establish whether any lawful basis ever existed. |
| **3 — Impact Assessment** | Identify where the tag blocked rights, access, or services. | Case notes, correspondence. | Record material harm. |
| **4 — Rectification Trigger** | File written requests for removal/downgrade under **UK GDPR Art. 16–19**. | DPO acknowledgements. | Formal correction cycle starts. |
| **5 — Cross-Propagation Check** | Ensure partners (NHS, MoJ, Police, contractors) have updated their mirrors. | Confirmation emails. | Synchronised rectification. |
| **6 — Closure & Archive** | Compile timeline, before/after evidence, and responses. | Signed closure memo. | Certified elimination of residual shadow. |

## 🧾 Red-Flag Indicators  

- The flag **predates** any MOD or ministerial involvement.  
- It was **copied automatically** between civilian systems.  
- Different departments **describe it inconsistently**.  
- It **affects reputation or service access** without lawful cause.  
- No one can produce the **original authority**.

*📜 Residual Shadow Audit* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how to expose and extinguish obsolete or fabricated security classifications, returning data to lawful civilian status.
