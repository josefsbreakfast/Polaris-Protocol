# 🛠️ Frankenstack Failure Modes in Public Systems  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*How legacy infrastructures, emergency patches, and federated tech create coercive-system effects.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
A Frankenstack is a system created through years of bolt-ons, migrations, vendor swaps, rushed fixes, and incompatible data flows.  
Public systems are especially vulnerable, producing harmful behaviour even when operating “as designed.”

---

## 🧿 Analysis  
### 1. **Legacy × Modern × Crisis**  
The Frankenstack formula:
- legacy infrastructure  
- modern interoperability  
- crisis-triggered patches  
- incompatible ML layers  
- conflicting data schemas

### 2. **Emergent coercive behaviour**  
Frankenstacks reliably produce:
- phantom risk labels  
- contradictory decisions  
- automated escalation  
- impossible appeals  
- looped referrals  
- corrupted identity resolution  
- duplicated or mirrored profiles

### 3. **Psychological footprint**  
To users, this feels indistinguishable from:
- gaslighting  
- coercive restriction  
- infantilising oversight  
- opaque threat  
- withdrawal of rights  
- destabilising inconsistency

### 4. **Why public systems break first**  
Because they combine:
- high stakes  
- low budgets  
- emergency expectations  
- political oversight  
- fragmented accountability  
- decades of uncoordinated upgrades

### 5. **The structural diagnosis**  
Frankenstacks are not accidents.  
They are what happens when institutions scale horizontally while tech evolves vertically.
