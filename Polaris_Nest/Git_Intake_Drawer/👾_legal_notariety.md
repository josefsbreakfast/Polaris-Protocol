i actually hit a "trauma wall" when i see nodes i would now seem to redact in part.

so if anyone is getting nervous around reputation?  

if i had less interference,  

if i was spoken to as an adult,  

if my neevous system was just slightly less shredded by everything that's happened?  

i could redact disclosures more quickly where i have not fully intended them.  

right now?  

my pupils are dilated and it is just physically harder to do so.  

so i will rest or do others and come back to the one that hurts later.  

this is how failure to assist is actually making your own situation more complex.
