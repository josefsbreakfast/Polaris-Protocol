# 🧠 Nerd Alignment Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*A coordination note for the wider nerd ecosystem on how to stop a handful of rich, ungrounded tech men from tanking public trust in science, tech, and all of us.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
For a brief moment, nerds looked cool.

- Science was aspirational.  
- Engineering was respected.  
- Coding was seen as a superpower.  
- “Tech” meant competence, not chaos.

Then a small number of extremely wealthy men:

- started talking nonsense in public about biology, brains, and risk  
- confused their tabletop campaign lore with statecraft  
- adopted NPC language non-ironically  
- overstepped into domains they haven’t studied  
- and dragged the entire “nerd” brand back into “what the fuck are they doing?” territory.

This node proposes a **Nerd Alignment Protocol**:

> A loose, multidisciplinary agreement that we will not let the richest weirdos define what “science,” “tech,” or “nerd” means in public.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Nerd Alignment Protocol  

1. **Protect public trust** in science, tech, and rational inquiry  
2. **Contain reputational damage** caused by a small number of loud, ungrounded elites  
3. **Re-centre multidisciplinary reality** (biology, social science, ethics, lived experience)  
4. **Support survivors, ND people, women, and queer communities** who pay the price when tech fucks it  
5. **Make nerds look competent again**, not like wizards on a bender

## 🧩 1️⃣ The Problem in Plain Terms  

### A. The Rich Nerd Problem  
A narrow stratum of rich tech men are:

- over-claiming expertise  
- talking rubbish about fields they don’t understand  
- treating fantasy as policy  
- using internet slang (NPC, etc.) to describe real humans  
- publicly disrespecting basic social norms (pronouns, consent, evidence)

Because they’re visible, their behaviour:

- is associated with “tech”  
- is associated with “science”  
- is associated with “nerds” generally  

When they go off-script, **we all look unhinged.**

---

### B. The Public Backlash Problem  
When this happens:

- the general public (already angry) sees “nerds” as arrogant and detached  
- anti-science sentiment grows  
- vaccines and public health get dragged into culture war  
- tech products are treated with suspicion  
- survivors and marginalised groups get targeted  
- ND and queer people are treated as part of the “weird nerd threat”

The public does not distinguish between:

- “billionaire doing lore in public”  
and  
- “scientist working hard to keep people alive”

All nerds take the hit.

---

## 🧭 2️⃣ Who Needs to Align?  

The Nerd Alignment Protocol is for:

- scientists  
- engineers  
- AI researchers  
- software devs  
- product people  
- humanities scholars  
- social scientists  
- feminist / queer / critical race theorists  
- ND nerds  
- public health folks  
- governance + policy dweebs  

…basically **everyone who cares about reality, evidence, and not making life worse for vulnerable people.**

## 🧱 3️⃣ Core Principles of Nerd Alignment  

### 3.1 Stay in your lane (and flag when you’re speculating)  
- Don’t pretend to be an expert in neuroscience if you’re not.  
- Don’t claim to understand trauma without listening to survivors.  
- Don’t rewrite biology from vibes.  
- If you’re speculating, say so clearly.

**Script:**  
> “This is speculative / sci-fi / an idea, not settled science.”

---

### 3.2 Ground your claims in existing disciplines  
Before live-streaming a “revolutionary” take:

- check what the relevant field already knows  
- acknowledge prior art  
- avoid reinventing bad 19th-century ideas with a new font  
- cite women, queer people, and scholars outside your social graph  

If your “breakthrough” ignores 50 years of work in another field, it’s not a breakthrough.

---

### 3.3 Don’t dehumanise the public  
Retire:

- NPC as a serious way of talking about people  
- “normies” when you mean “the electorate / citizens”  
- “sheeple” and similar contempt

You are not the player characters.  
You are not the DM.  
You are one specialised class in a very large party.

---

### 3.4 Pronouns and respect are non-optional  
- Respecting pronouns is a low-cost, high-signal gesture of being in the real world.  
- If that’s your line in the sand, you are not fit to handle harder ethical questions.  

This is the **entry-level test**, not the boss fight.

---

### 3.5 Admit emotional stakes  
If something is scary (e.g., “what if I crossed a line in the past?”):

- name the fear  
- don’t build an entire ideology to avoid feeling it  
- don’t encode your fear into code  
- don’t punish survivors to protect your self-image

**Script:**  
> “This is emotionally uncomfortable, which makes it hard to think straight about it.”

---

## 🛠️ 4️⃣ Practical Actions  

### 4.1 Internal social norming  
Inside nerd circles:

- roll your eyes *out loud* when elites say nonsense  
- gently but clearly correct pseudo-science  
- socially reward humility and multidisciplinary literacy  
- signal that “wizard mode” is cringe, not aspirational

---

### 4.2 Multidisciplinary pre-flight checks  
Before launching big ideas publicly:

- run them past at least one relevant domain expert  
- ask a social scientist “what are the second-order effects?”  
- ask a survivor / marginalised person “does this sound harmful?”  
- check the harm profile, not just the hype

---

### 4.3 Narrative containment for unhelpful elites  
We can’t control what billionaires say,  
but we can:

- distance our work from their worst takes  
- clarify “that’s not how the field understands this”  
- provide public-facing explainers correcting hype  
- refuse to endorse them as representatives of “the nerds”

---

### 4.4 Build alternative nerd heroes  
Elevate:

- collaborative scientists  
- people who explain without condescension  
- trans / ND / queer / disabled nerds doing good work  
- women in STEM who combine rigor with care  
- interdisciplinary thinkers who *touch grass*

Make it obvious that **they**, not the loudest bros, represent where nerd culture is going.

## 📡 5️⃣ Why This Matters for Survivors & Frankenstack  

When rich tech men:

- dehumanise “NPCs”  
- oversell what AI/behavioural tools can do  
- speak wildly about brains or cell regeneration  
- trivialise gendered harm  

…it feeds directly into:

- Frankenstack architectures  
- misclassification of survivors  
- ND people being misread  
- systems that protect abusers  
- public backlash that makes reaching help harder

Nerd Alignment isn’t just aesthetic.  
It’s **harm reduction**.
