# 🧮 Algorithms of the Wolf  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How algorithmic systems amplify, disguise, and weaponise the Wolf of Westminster.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The Wolf of Westminster is not just offline pageantry; it is an **algorithmic organism**.

Clips from prestige events are fed into:

- TikTok  
- YouTube  
- Twitter/X  
- Instagram Reels  

Algorithms amplify them because they perform well on engagement metrics, not because they are true or healthy.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Algorithmic uplift of “serious” extremist‑coded content.  
- Offline prestige → online virality → offline recruitment loop.  
- Emotional vectors: fear + certainty.  
- Aesthetic repackaging to boost shareability.  
- Cross‑platform feedback loops.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Hybrid Species  
Offline:

- conferences, panels, NatCon theatrics  

Online:

- viral clips, edits, reaction videos, memes  

The two environments feed each other.

### 2. Why Prestige Clips Go Viral  
Algorithms like:

- high emotional charge  
- apparent expertise  
- clear moral stakes  
- professional visuals  

A man in a suit preaching doom spreads faster than a rant in a hoodie.

### 3. Emotional Payload  
Fear (“civilisational collapse”) plus certainty (“we alone see it clearly”) makes content addictive.

### 4. Pipeline Loop  
1. Record prestige event.  
2. Clip the panic lines.  
3. Push to short‑form platforms.  
4. Algorithms boost them.  
5. Young men discover them.  
6. Some show up to the next prestige event.
