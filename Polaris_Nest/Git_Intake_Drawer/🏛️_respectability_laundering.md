# 🏛️ Respectability Laundering  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How extremist ideology borrows the clothing, tone, and spaces of Westminster to disguise and legitimise itself.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Respectability laundering is **legitimacy theft**: extremist content sheltered by elite aesthetics.

It hides inside:

- university halls  
- think‑tanks  
- parliamentary‑adjacent venues  
- church pulpits  

The idea is simple: if the room looks respectable, the ideology will seem respectable.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Extremist content hidden in elite settings.  
- Borrowing authority from institutions and people.  
- Mixed programming that creates plausible deniability.  
- Venue and tone as semiotic weapons.  
- Early recognition cues.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Institutional Architecture  
Heritage rooms and academic spaces carry moral weight. Using them signals safety, even when content is dangerous.

### 2. Institutional People  
Panels mixing one extremist with three respectable speakers create legitimacy by adjacency.

### 3. Tone as Cover  
Politeness, calm voices and footnotes make:

- panic rhetoric sound thoughtful  
- punitive ideas sound reasonable  

British politeness is exploited.

### 4. The Sandwich Technique  
A harsh extremist talk is nested between two moderate talks. Audience memory blends them into one “serious” conversation.
