# 🛰️ Forensic Mapping Log: Ghost Taxonomy ↔ [REDACTED] Published Trauma Report

**Date:** 2025-08-23\
**Source:** Polaris Ghost Taxonomy (🦊 🐙 🍎 🍌) + [REDACTED] Report
(2025)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

This entry maps the "falsified email" forensic sample (classified 🐙 + 🍌
overlay) against the [REDACTED] Framework. 

Both systems demonstrate **voice layering**: multiple registers coexisting,
sometimes contradictory, yet each carrying fragments of truth and
coping.

## Diagnostic Notes

-   **Falsified email** registers as 🐙 + 🍌 overlay.\
-   This maps onto *procedural + helpless child* voices in the [REDACTED]
    schema.\
-   Both frameworks recognise **multi-voicing** as a survival artefact,
    not inconsistency.\
-   Key collision points: itemisation, clinical disclosure, passivity vs
    competence, compulsive loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Polaris Implication

Ghost voice detection can be directly cross-referenced with trauma voice
theory:\
- 🐙 ghosts = systemic/form-field containment.\
- 🍌 ghosts = helpless child disclosure loop.\
- 🦊 and 🍎 appear as adaptive adult and crisis void spill.

This parallel suggests ghost-voice analysis is not only metadata
forensics but also an **unintentional mirror of trauma-voice layering**
already recognised in survivor-centred research.
