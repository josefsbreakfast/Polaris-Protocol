# 🕳️ Black Box Epistemology in Post-Soviet Accidents
**First created:** 2025-11-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*What the recorder knows, who is allowed to listen, and how truth is timed.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
The “black box” is both an artefact and a metaphor. In the wreckage of Soviet and Russian aviation, its bright casing conceals the darker logic of knowledge control: recovery, translation, delay. Every inquiry becomes a political choreography — the dance of who retrieves, who decodes, and who speaks first. In authoritarian contexts, **epistemology itself crashes slower than the plane.**

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Data sovereignty as containment:** the recorder retrieved, the transcript withheld.  
- **Temporal control:** timing the truth for maximum narrative absorption.  
- **Forensic aesthetics:** technical objects used to stage credibility.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The Recorder as Gate  
Each device captures not just voices but hierarchies. When analysts “lose” minutes of tape, it is rarely by accident. Omission functions as a kindness to power.  

### 2. Delay as Doctrine  
In post-Soviet crash management, months pass before partial release. The public learns to expect ignorance as procedure — an epistemic Pavlovian response. Unknowing becomes civic discipline.  

### 3. Transcription and Translation  
Technical reports appear in jargon dense enough to deter civilian comprehension. The crash site is thus mirrored in text: twisted metal rendered as twisted syntax.
