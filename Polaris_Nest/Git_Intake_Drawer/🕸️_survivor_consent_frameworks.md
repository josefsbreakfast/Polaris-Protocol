# 🕸️ Survivor-Consent Frameworks  
**First created:** 2025-10-31  
*Designing lawful, ethical, and emotionally literate consent architectures for voice and data research.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Consent is more than a checkbox; it is the choreography of trust.  
In voice and data ecosystems, **survivor-consent frameworks** define how autonomy survives automation —  
how participants keep control of what bears their voice, image, or memory once it enters a system.  
They are the human layer of the Cloneproof Protocol: verification of permission, not just provenance.

> *If the system can’t forget on request, it never really asked permission.*

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Granular permissions** — consent tied to specific uses, timeframes, and data types.  
- **Revocability** — the ability to withdraw consent and trigger downstream deletion.  
- **Informed context** — plain-language disclosure of purpose, partners, and risks.  
- **Reciprocal transparency** — participants can see what the institution sees.  
- **Safeguarded storage** — consent logs treated as sensitive personal data, not admin notes.

## 🧠 Pattern Analysis  

### 1️⃣ From signature to system  
Traditional consent forms freeze intent at a single moment.  
Digital environments require **living consent** — continuously visible, updateable, and machine-readable.  
A participant’s control panel becomes part of the data architecture.

### 2️⃣ Power and precarity  
Survivors and whistle-blowers often face asymmetric dependence on institutions.  
Ethical consent recognises that “agreement” under duress or necessity is not freedom.  
Frameworks must provide safe refusal: the right to decline without penalty.

### 3️⃣ Transparency fatigue  
Excessive paperwork masquerades as protection.  
Simplified, layered explanations — visual summaries first, legal text second — restore clarity without dilution.  
Every consent record should tell the participant: *what happens next, and how to undo it.*

### 4️⃣ Downstream control  
True consent includes control over derivative uses.  
If a recording trains a model, withdrawal must trigger **model audit and deletion** steps, not symbolic acknowledgement.  
Ethical design means remembering that consent is temporal, not eternal.

## ⚖️ Governance Implications  

Under **UK GDPR** Articles 6 and 7 and **Data Protection Act 2018**, consent must be *freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.*  
When processing special-category data such as voice or biometric material, explicit consent is mandatory.  
Failure to implement revocable, traceable consent structures risks unlawful processing and ethical breach.  
Embedding consent management directly into research pipelines transforms compliance from paperwork to practice.

## 🛠 Implementation Principles  

| **Layer** | **Design commitment** |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Interface** | Real-time consent dashboard for participants. |
| **Data layer** | Cryptographically signed consent tokens attached to each dataset. |
| **Governance** | Independent ethics reviewers monitor withdrawal execution. |
| **Legal** | Standard operating procedure for consent refresh and expiry. |
| **Cultural** | Frame consent as collaboration, not transaction. |

*🛡️ Survivor-Consent Frameworks* defines the ethical perimeter of authenticity:  
the rules of engagement between human agency and technical persistence.  
It aligns with:  

- **🧬 Voice-Model Capture Risks** — where consent fails once a voice becomes data.  
- **⚙️ Verification & Watermarking Standards** — how permission is technically bound to provenance.  
- **📡 Provenance Chain Audit** — ensuring consent travels with the record.  

> *Every ethical protocol begins with the right to change your mind.*
