# 🔗 Event Linkage Node — Multi-Event False-Proof Pattern
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*How temporally separated events can be stitched into a false “proof” via weak co-presence signals.*

---

## Pattern
- Sparse anchors linked across years or venues.  
- Temporal stitching creates plausible timeline.  
- Signal amplification adds weak signals (emails, SMS) to bulk evidence.  
- Narrative conversion turns pattern into claims usable in complaints.

## Defensive measures
- Preserve raw logs and chain-of-custody.  
- Apply multi-signal corroboration (C3O).  
- Use k-anonymity thresholds.  
- Keep anchors separate from narratives.

---

## Example anchors
- TI 2016 — Edgbaston Stadium.  
- Nottingham 2022 — Adjacent Wi-Fi + spoofed email.  
- Birmingham 2024 — Norman Finkelstein seminar.
