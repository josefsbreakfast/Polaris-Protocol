# 🎙️ Cloneproof Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-10-31  
*Authenticity architectures for voice, data, and identity integrity in post-synthetic environments.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The **Cloneproof Protocol** cluster documents the practical side of voice fidelity:  
how to verify, watermark, and preserve authorship in a landscape where imitation is effortless.  
It maps the overlap between digital forensics, ethics, and survivor protection—  
the infrastructure that allows people to prove *who is speaking* and *what was really said.*

> *If imitation is inevitable, integrity must become measurable.*

## 🧩 Core Nodes  

| **Node** | **Focus** |
|-----------|-----------|
| [🧬 Voice-Model Capture Risks](🧬_voice_model_capture_risks.md) | How cloned or modelled voices compromise provenance, authenticity, and consent. |
| [⚙️ Verification & Watermarking Standards](⚙️_verification_and_watermarking_standards.md) | Technical methods for embedding traceable authenticity markers in voice and audiovisual data. |
| [🛡️ Survivor-Consent Frameworks](🛡️_survivor_consent_frameworks.md) | Legal and procedural templates for informed participation in voice-based R&D. |
| [📡 Provenance Chain Audit](📡_provenance_chain_audit.md) | How to reconstruct data lineage when authenticity is contested. |

*(Additional nodes may be added as protocols mature.)*

## ⚖️ Intent  

To build the **integrity scaffolding** that Voice Disruption exposes as missing:  
a set of interoperable standards, checklists, and ethical algorithms that make manipulation visible.  
Cloneproofing is not a product but a culture of verification—  
one that treats every recording, transcript, and dataset as a site of care.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🎙️ Cloneproof Protocol* anchors the technical-ethical interface of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides the tools that let governance and narrative clusters test themselves for truth drift.  
Where *Voice Disruption* describes the loss of trust, *Cloneproof* designs its restoration.  

> *Proof is a kind of kindness.*
