*When institutional crisis-scripts borrow their erotics from popular fiction.*
<!--Please touch some grass; you've got enough of the stuff.-->

## 🧭 Orientation  
Satirical-forensic analysis of how bureaucracies narrativise scandal using pop-culture archetypes.  
Shows how gendered and racialised tropes (the “over-emotional woman,” the “dangerous foreign man”) become PR shorthand during liability containment.  
Institutions plagiarise fan-fiction logic to turn misconduct into melodrama, converting reputational panic into gossip management.
<!--Also: please read some Said and Fanon?-->

## 📑 Key Sections  

1. **Erotics of Control**  
   - Crisis comms borrow language from romance thrillers: *forbidden, obsessive, unstable.*  
   - “Professional boundaries” become the moral safe-word of administrative kink.
<!--As if these institutions respect safe words. 🤣-->
2. **Archetype Casting**  
   - Women framed through *excess*: too loud, too feeling, too online.  
   - Men of colour cast as *risk*: seductive, volatile, foreign.  
   - The pair functions as a morality play about compliance, not people.
<!--Again with the, "please read the books in your own libraries".-->
3. **Narrative as NDA**  
   - Once the script circulates, facts become fiction.  
   - The melodrama distracts donors and regulators from the spreadsheet labelled *damages.*  
<!--And boy is that a big spreadsheet.-->
4. **Procedural Pornography**  
   - HR emails read like pulp dialogue: *“She was non-compliant with tone expectations.”*  
   - Paper trails replace whips; signatures replace safewords.  
<!--Overly padded internal files tell on themselves.-->
5. **Avoidance Economy**  
   - Settlements re-cast as “closure arcs.”  
   - Institutional desire is always for silence, never satisfaction.
<!--Because it's okay for the institution to be imperfect, just not the humams in it.-->
