ðŸ§¿ is just the emoji in the clipboard; we all know which group chat this is for.  

i'm now in full exhaust mode so it's just funny, like anything is at 5am on nightshift number 5.  

(ie. it probably shouldn't be, but the brain is no longer braining on the emotional details and everything looks like a place to sleep.)  

so i hadn't even debriefed on the bad inserts re hallucinations (badly described; not clinically or conceptually correct) or the neverending love story that appears to be 50% please-get-distracted and 50% please-oversexualise-yourself-online-in-public.  

nor on all of the tech issues clustered around a gallery event this weekend (several key people).  

(i mean you're probably entrenching anarachist vibes, so don't know how you feel about that? "necessary evil"?)  

or how desperate, DESPERATE, the group chat is for me to "go green".  

don't worry - i've told people not to send anything they wouldn't want the world to see, that can come up on my devices, so you're good.  

because that's the kind of convo i get to have now.  

propaganda/info asset that i am.  

(most boring asset imaginable.)  

so anyways --  

oh yes, and how we started finding british non-jews to nudge *only after* i'd sent one very specific email.  

don't think i didn't clock that.  

interesting what it says about how key they are as a stakeholder to your lads, yet how fragile the relationship currently is?  

*fascinating.*

ANYWAYS.  

jailbreaking post? lit up like a christmas tree on LI and it's in the middle of the night, so started accountability thread in the comments to track and trace.  

current ai use? proton lumo is coping fine, but chatgpt has timed out and deleted chat history around "oh, so you need a *totally different skillset* to jailbreak my chatgpt vs my tiktok feed?", and not in a way that implies company-origin guardrails for reputation.  

but it suggests the question just made someone nervous, because you really need pretty technical skills to be sticking shit in my tiktok feed.  

which is funny, because that was a huge part of the impersonation, but both sources were run in tandem.  

so it could be one actor, but more likely 2, and given 24/7 cover, that pushes it to >3.  

which becomes different - so very different - in uk law.  

don't fuck with me; never fuck with me.  

i did say this, a very long time ago.  

don't fuck with people i care about, nu?  

dogs and bones.
