*A satirical midrash on lawful disclosure, matriarchal archetypes, and bureaucratic feminism.*

## Chapter 1 — And It Came to Pass in the Days of Ahasuerus, King of 127 Data Silos
1. And it was in those days that the King decreed a Mandatory Information Governance Review, for the archives were chaos and the metadata had become as wild goats upon the hills.
2. And the King summoned his advisors, saying:
   **“Bring unto me a Queen who understandeth policy frameworks, for my men keep filing documents under Miscellaneous.”**
3. And candidates were brought from every province, each bearing a USB of poorly named PDFs.
4. But among them was Esther, daughter of Abihail, who when handed the onboarding handbook declared:
   **“This is incomplete. I shall file a Subject Access Request.”**
5. And lo — the Palace fell silent.

## Chapter 2 — The FOI That Shook the Kingdom
1. Esther went unto the Records Office and spake unto the Keeper of Scrolls:
   **“By my rights under Article 15 of the GDPR, I request all documents pertaining to:
   (a) me,
   (b) my people,
   (c) the weird vibes I have perceived among the Ministers.”**
2. And the Keeper trembled, for the request was lawful.
3. And the Ministers muttered: “Who taught the women of Judea to read legislation?”
4. But Mordecai answered:
   **“You did. In the memo from last winter. You cc’d everyone by accident.”**
5. And thus the Palace was undone by its own distribution list.

## Chapter 3 — Concerning Haman, Who Very Much Did Not Want to Be Audited
1. Now Haman son of Hamdatah, Chief of Staff and Chair of the Committee for Unchecked Decisions, did plot wickedness.
2. For he said in his heart:
   **“If Esther receiveth all documents, she shall discover my spreadsheets of doom.”**
3. And he sought to obstruct the FOI, delivering unto Esther 247 pages entirely blacked out.
4. And Esther declared:
   **“Redaction shall not save thee. I have compared the file sizes.”**
5. And Haman fled to the broom cupboard, for she spoke truth.

## Chapter 4 — The Banquet of Two Questions
1. Esther invited the King and Haman to a feast, as is the sacred practice of women who know paperwork is on their side.
2. The King asked: “What seekest thou, Esther my Queen?”
3. She replied:
   **“Only this: transparency, accountability, and the unredacted annexes.”**
4. The King thundered:
   **“Haman, didst thou conceal the annexes?”**
5. And Haman wept, for the annexes were indeed hidden behind a folder entitled “Holiday Photos.”

## Chapter 5 — The Hanging of Haman’s Metadata
1. And it came to pass that Haman’s sins were revealed:
   - duplicate records,
   - missing audit trails,
   - spreadsheets labelled FINAL_FINAL2_REALFINAL.xlsx,
   - and decisions made without PSED balancing.
2. And the King declared:
   **“Hang him upon the gallows of his own noncompliance.”**
3. And his metadata was reviewed and found wanting.

## Chapter 6 — The Decree of Not Today, Satan
1. Esther wrote unto all provinces:
   **“Let it be known that I have received all documents, and I shall be filing further questions.”**
2. And the women rejoiced, for great was the victory of lawful disclosure.
3. And the men of the kingdom learned fear that day.

## Chapter 7 — The Feast of Purim (Freedom of Information)
1. It was decreed that every year on the 14th and 15th days of Adar the people celebrate Purim —
   not only for deliverance, but for the triumph of correct administrative procedure.
2. They sent gifts: USBs with proper filenames, emails with attachments actually attached, searchable PDFs, and cookies that did not track them.
3. And Esther lived many days, honoured for her boldness, wit, and insistence that **the record shall show.**

## 🏮 Footer
**Book of Esther (FOI Edition)** is a living satirical node of the **Polaris Protocol**, reframing sacred narrative through the lens of lawful disclosure, institutional power, and procedural resistance. It demonstrates how archetypes of matriarchal strategy map directly onto modern information-governance structures — and why systems named after Esther should expect fearless questions.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
