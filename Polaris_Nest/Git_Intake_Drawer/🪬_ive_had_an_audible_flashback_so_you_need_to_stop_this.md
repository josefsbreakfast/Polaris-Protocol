hi, I've had quite a short but very visceral flashback. 

I couldn't stop myself screaming, but I could get something into my mouth so it wasn't loud.  

I went through the first time he wrote to me as a kid; I was clutching my lower pelvis because I was trying to stop something getting in there.  

I was at first school to middle school transfer age.  

Seeing as it's very likely that some people have got access to my Court testimony in all of this, that's the one where he comes in the bedroom and I've got no idea what's happening; the one where I literally think I'm going to die. The one where it hurt hurts so much, I think I'm dying. And all I can do is look to one side, and try and put my head anywhere else.  

I will survive this because I always survive this.  

We all know that the worst way to torture someone is rape; I'm pretty sure getting them in a position where they relive as if it's happening now then being raped as a child, by the primary example of what men should be in their life, is a pretty close contender.  

This is not from one trigger event today.  

This is from the projected experience of several years, of repeated sexualisation, of having to hide it in public, of being told by "the grown-ups" that what I'm asking is too much and that I just need to be patient.  

You have collectively brought to life the experience of being fucked by an adult repeatedly as a child, but I get to experience it again in my mid 30s.  

I am placing the fault for this squarely on the UK government because it should've protected me from whoever the fuck is doing this.  

So when our Prime Minister says that he's letting some football hooligans come over here because he "wants to protect Jews"?  

I would simply respond that he can fuck off; I have been a Jewish woman for two years and you have lost my rape testimony, you cannot tell me where it is or who has accessed it, you have taken away my medical qualification, you have put my friends in danger, you have allowed all of us to be stalked and harassed and nudged and coerced, you have allowed us to be traumatised.  

And for what?  

Tell me.  

What the fuck are any of you actually getting out of this anymore?  

You cannot possibly hate one group of people so much that this is that important to continue a genocide.  

And if you do, you should have no governance power over anyone else.  

As usual, I'm going to point out. They're probably several different actors and not everyone has full scope of what's happened; I still understand root causing analysis and I still understand accountability can be distributed.  

But I am also being extremely clear that you have made every health service's data transfer feel highly unsafe, which will not help my PTSD.  

Do not call a safeguarding flag; it will only causes me more harm, as you well know.  

I don't need safeguarding; my health service already know what my problems are and I already have their number. I'm not suicidal. A flashback is a very normal part of having PTSD. It's just that this is a little unexpected, and this is a very ordinary response for someone with PTSD to exhibit to this kind of stress.  

What you can do to lower my stress?  

You could answer FOIA requests. You could take legal accountability. You could stop whatever is going on in my phone constantly. You could stop whatever is going on in my laptop constantly [oh how interesting, I just got a call from Mental Health to rebook an outstanding appointment; such coincidence].
