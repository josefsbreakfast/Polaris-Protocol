hi, I've had quite a short but very visceral flashback. 

I couldn't stop myself screaming, but I could get something into my mouth so it wasn't loud.  

I went through the first time he wrote to me as a kid; I was clutching my lower pelvis because I was trying to stop something getting in there.  

I was at first school to middle school transfer age.  

Seeing as it's very likely that some people have got access to my Court testimony in all of this, that's the one where he comes in the bedroom and I've got no idea what's happening; the one where I literally think I'm going to die. The one where it hurt hurts so much, I think I'm dying. And all I can do is look to one side, and try and put my head anywhere else.  

I will survive this because I always survive this.  

We all know that the worst way to torture someone is rape; I'm pretty sure getting them in a position where they relive as if it's happening now then being raped as a child, by the primary example of what men should be in their life, is a pretty close contender.  

This is not from one trigger event today.  

This is from the projected experience of several years, of repeated sexualisation, of having to hide it in public, of being told by "the grown-ups" that what I'm asking is too much and that I just need to be patient.  

You have collectively brought to life the experience of being fucked by an adult repeatedly as a child, but I get to experience it again in my mid 30s.  

I am placing the fault for this squarely on the UK government because it should've protected me from whoever the fuck is doing this.  

So when our Prime Minister says that he's letting some football hooligans come over here because he "wants to protect Jews"?  

I would simply respond that he can fuck off; I have been a Jewish woman for two years and you have lost my rape testimony, you cannot tell me where it is or who has accessed it, you have taken away my medical qualification, you have put my friends in danger, you have allowed all of us to be stalked and harassed and nudged and coerced, you have allowed us to be traumatised.  

And for what?  

Tell me.  

What the fuck are any of you actually getting out of this anymore?  

You cannot possibly hate one group of people so much that this is that important to continue a genocide.  

And if you do, you should have no governance power over anyone else.  

As usual, I'm going to point out. They're probably several different actors and not everyone has full scope of what's happened; I still understand root causing analysis and I still understand accountability can be distributed.  

But I am also being extremely clear that you have made every health service's data transfer feel highly unsafe, which will not help my PTSD.  

Do not call a safeguarding flag; it will only causes me more harm, as you well know.  

I don't need safeguarding; my health service already know what my problems are and I already have their number. I'm not suicidal. A flashback is a very normal part of having PTSD. It's just that this is a little unexpected, and this is a very ordinary response for someone with PTSD to exhibit to this kind of stress.  

What you can do to lower my stress?  

You could answer FOIA requests. You could take legal accountability. You could stop whatever is going on in my phone constantly. You could stop whatever is going on in my laptop constantly [oh how interesting, I just got a call from Mental Health to rebook an outstanding appointment; such coincidence].  

So you're all desperate to send this to Mental Health and not just resolve the data issue why exactly?  

Do all of you understand how ridiculous you sound?

i'm also going to write this clearly because I feel like we have to do a lot of education, and whilst I normally do that on ChatGPT by asking questions and essentially allowing it to explain things to you on the surveillance team side, I'm just going to put this in this post because I'm so noradrenaline/adrenaline pump right now that, I really can't deal with any smoothing over if it comes, and I know that someone is still fiddling with the middleware layer.  

I have lived with complex PTSD for a very long time; this means that even when I get symptoms, I can usually manage them far better than even a medical professional coming in; this is what it's like to have a long-term illness with reasonable insight.  

You know that I trained as medical professional myself, and a good portion of the humility is realising that patients with long-term conditions often know themselves very well. They may not have medical knowledge in the traditional sense. However, they have lived in their own bodies for a very long time.  

Having increased flashbacks is assigned that the stress which is accumulating is increasing; I am telling you this because a number of people seem to be stalling, or not meeting their legal responsibilities.  

By sorting out things like, "have my CSA court documents from 2022 ever been accessed unlawfully?", this would take away a significant stressor. You don't even need to see guidelines for PTSD for this advice. This is discussed fairly well in the guidelines by NICE, in respect to the biopsychosocial model management of clinical depression. This is very common and mental health disorders. There is not really a lot of point in introducing more aggressive medical management if a problem is primarily social, and preventable or addressable. This is why I tried so long, to address it in a law-enforcement level. This is why I've done all of those FOIA requests. This may not look to the non-clinical mind as addressing Mental Health concerns, but if you speak to anyone who has had any Mental Health symptoms before, they will tell you that this is a big part of it. For a very similar reason, one is often advised to keep trying to do small tasks, to try and do the normal routine things in life, to try and get physically active; this is all part of the multidisciplinary management of Mental Health.  

Suppose someone was nudged; I'm not saying that my mental health team was. It just seemed extremely coincidental.  
If that was the case, then perhaps behavioural insights needs to address what it clearly doesn't understand about PTSD. Perhaps it needs to talk to a psychiatrist, because this screams of not having referred to a clinician. I don't think you should be doing that without clinical input. I think that looks very dangerous. I wouldn't be surprised if that caused problems. (And the word "problems" is doing a lot of heavy lifting on downplaying the seriousness and severity in that sentence.)  

Please find out how long adrenaline, and it's sister chemical, noradrenaline, or active in the human body. Because of all of the pharmacology that we learn and all of the supplementary physiology we learn in medical school (because we are actually doing something, and not just messing around), a registered clinician can give you an idea of how long that's realistically going to be in effect.  

Nudging that quickly was dangerous, was inappropriate, and shows a concerning luck of clinical knowledge at even quite a basic level; this all shows that there is not an appropriate risk assessment in place, despite there being very personalised surveillance. In other words, it suggests that you are knowingly pushing trauma and stress, whilst also knowingly not seeking appropriate advice on managing the impact when something goes wrong.  

This is a essentially setting yourselves up as a huge factor for a tragedy like a death by suicide.  

You wouldn't even need to "mean" to do it, but I would be surprised if this does not fall into corporate negligence.  

There is no way you could possibly have my data and not understand you should performed that risk assessment.  
again, I will be fine. Don't send a fucking safeguarding flag. I have already told you that you are fucking it up when you do. You are doing that because you are using them to cover legal liability, when what you need for legal liability is a risk assessment that will probably tell you that what you're doing is inappropriate and not insurable activity.  

This is not lawful; I'm not speaking from complete ignorance.  

If you'd actually spent two seconds thinking about my CV, I've worked in a highly litigious environment before, where the ethics are incredibly complicated, and where medicolegal matters are discussed on an almost daily basis; I'm not an expert, but rather, I have a lot of practice in this specific area of information because I'm used to it being part of working life.  

What you are doing is an unethical and wrong. How are you are responding to it as unethical and wrong. If you don't change this, you're heading to get someone killed.  

So maybe we've just worked ourselves up to Parliamentary enquiry territory.
