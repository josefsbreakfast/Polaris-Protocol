# 🧲 Starmer as Lightning Rod

*Why modernising the CPS placed Starmer at the centre of a long-running institutional backlash.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explains why Keir Starmer—regardless of personal virtue, policy, charisma, or political stance—functions as a **structural lightning rod** for institutional hostility in Britain.

His time as Director of Public Prosecutions modernised one of the UK’s youngest and most fragile institutions.  
By professionalising CPS decision-making, centring victims’ rights, and insulating charging decisions from political pressure, he unintentionally became the **symbol** of reforms that powerful interests still want reversed.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- CPS as a *young* institution uniquely vulnerable to attack.  
- Starmer’s reforms threatened entrenched norms of discretion, informality, and influence.  
- Trauma‑informed prosecution undermined long-standing press and police narratives.  
- Undermining him is the fastest route to undermining the reforms.  
- Press hostility reflects institutional backlash, not just personal failings.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The CPS Is a Young Institution, and Young Institutions Are Easy Targets  
The Crown Prosecution Service, created in 1986, lacks the centuries-deep legitimacy of the courts, Parliament, or the police. Youth in institutional design means:

- no ancestral “tradition” to appeal to  
- no entrenched public mythology  
- easier to portray as malfunctioning  
- weaker professional folklore  
- more vulnerable to press distortion and political narrative capture  

Starmer’s modernisation efforts therefore landed on an institution with **low defences** and **high symbolic stakes**.

### 2. He Professionalised Areas People Preferred to Keep Informal  
His tenure is associated with:

- consistent national charging standards  
- stronger evidence thresholds against bias  
- reduced police discretion in framing cases  
- clearer separation between politics and prosecution  
- more serious consideration of sexual and domestic violence cases  

Professionalisation disrupts people who benefitted from discretion. Discretion is where power hides.

### 3. Victim‑Centred Modernisation Threatened Long‑Standing Narratives  
By embedding more trauma‑aware reasoning into charging decisions, Starmer:

- destabilised the “perfect victim” myth  
- reduced the power of character assassination  
- narrowed the space for press‑led moral theatre  
- increased the likelihood of charging “difficult” offenders  

For certain media and institutional actors, these shifts were experienced as existential threats to their way of operating.

### 4. Charging Reforms Limited Informal Influence Over Justice  
Historically, power could be exerted through:

- quiet phone calls  
- relationships with senior police  
- informal warnings  
- back‑channel messaging  
- “gut feeling” decisions  

Modern, rules‑based CPS practice constrains those channels. If you want those levers back, you attack the person most identified with removing them.

### 5. Destabilising Him Destabilises the Reforms  
Starmer’s public identity is welded to:

- rule‑bound charging  
- trauma‑aware interpretation  
- evidence‑led consistency  
- depoliticised prosecutions  

Discrediting him creates political cover to:

- roll back victim‑centred standards  
- restore wider zones of discretion  
- re‑normalise press‑led moral judgement  
- weaken CPS independence  

Attacking him becomes a **shortcut** to restoring pre‑reform norms.

### 6. Why He Is a Permanent “Shit Magnet”  
It is not primarily about personality or charisma.  
He is the **human avatar** of a modernised, rule‑bound, victim‑centred justice system.  
The system that benefits from informality, discretion, and narrative control has an interest in keeping that avatar tarnished.

Starmer’s press treatment is therefore a **proxy war** over who controls public meaning and prosecutorial authority in Britain.
