I appreciate it might be a bit late to ask this.  

I actually really want to see some of your architecture and your cultural hotspots.  

It would actually be super cool if you if you could stamp the visa when I apply for it?   

Thanks!

(I'm just aware that you're not necessarily taking the current drafting very well, and I appreciate that I might be poking some holes in the general plan, but to be fair, it was primarily to hold British and Israeli men accountable, so you're just sort of... in the way at this point? Hope you understand ❤️)
