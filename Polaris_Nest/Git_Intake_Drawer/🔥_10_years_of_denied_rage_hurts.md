I am patient.  

I will waiting as long as I must.  

But a decade of rage denied, is painful.  

It physically hurts me.  

You think Monica was bad?  

She stayed as pixels.  

I have real corporeal hands and arms, real calcaneous bomes, real skeletal muscles...  

And I remain being denied.  

Not told what the fuck any of you have done with me giving testimony of being raped as a child in an English court...  

Not told why the fuck I was arrested, why you threw PACE out the window.  

Not told who the fuck was on security and why I lost my professional degree.  

Emails went missing, stalked by law men for months...

Why the fuck was I nudged?

Why did you traffic me?  

I don't even know where to start on the repeated blocks if desperately teying to get a lawyer.

And yet.  

Some will say this is too emotional because the word "fuck" is used for emphasis.  

...priorities, right?  

She's not perfect in your eyes.  

So sye can live the rest of her life with a smashed pelvis.  

*She deserves it for her imperfections under unethical tests.*
