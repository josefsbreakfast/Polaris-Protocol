# 🕸️ Algorithmic Hearing Is Not Listening

*How “listening metrics” simulate responsiveness while erasing real political voice.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Modern democratic institutions claim to be more responsive than ever — feedback forms, sentiment dashboards, analytics suites, polling engines, engagement metrics.  
But this **algorithmic hearing** functions less like listening and more like *noise management*.  
It creates the *appearance* of accountability while deepening representational silence.

What politicians hear today is not the public; it is **a statistical hallucination of the public**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- **Dashboard Substitution**  
  Decision-makers rely on synthetic indicators — “engagement,” “reach,” “sentiment,” “risk alerts” — that flatten the nuance of human experience.

- **Sampling Without Relationship**  
  Metrics rely on data extraction, not dialogue. They measure behaviour without understanding context.

- **Optimised Harm**  
  Systems are tuned to reduce reputational damage, not to surface moral or civic truth.  
  Feedback loops reward what is loud, polarising, or profitable.

- **Metric Capture**  
  Public voice is shaped by what platforms measure, not by what people need. Visibility becomes a commodity; grievances must perform.

- **Responsiveness Theatre**  
  Institutions use analytics as evidence of listening even when they have no direct, relational contact with constituents.

## 🧿 Analysis  
In algorithmic governance, “listening” becomes a **simulation layer** that stands in for presence.

The dynamic looks like this:

1. Constituencies are reduced to data subjects.  
2. Data is aggregated through platform architectures.  
3. Platforms optimise for their own revenue and stability.  
4. Politicians read dashboards shaped by Step 3, not Step 1.  
5. Public voice disappears into the noise floor.

The result is a **feedback inversion**:  
- genuine needs become *systemically inaudible*,  
- extreme statements get over-amplified,  
- and communities without platform presence become algorithmically silent.

This is not just a governance failure — it is a *representational blackout*.

Because when the public is only heard through metrics,  
those metrics become the electorate.

*Algorithmic Hearing as False Accountability* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how analytic tools simulate democratic responsiveness while structurally erasing the public from its own governance.
