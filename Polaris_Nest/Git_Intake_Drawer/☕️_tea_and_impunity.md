# ☕️ Tea and Impunity  
**First created:** 2025-11-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*Satirical manual for instant governmental inquiries, framed as a tea‑time recipe.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
In times of scandal, the British state has one reliable reflex: put the kettle on and launch an inquiry. This manual offers a quick‑brew recipe for institutional absolution — no fuss, no flavour, ready in minutes.

## 🧩 Instant Inquiry Mix  

**Ingredient** | **Quantity / Function**  
--- | ---  
Mild Shock | One front‑page headline – generates urgency without panic.  
Senior Retiree | One knighted chairperson – adds gravitas and amnesia.  
Terms of Reference | Two pages, vague – limits collateral transparency.  
Public Statement | Half a paragraph – signals accountability theatre.  
Tea & Biscuits | Unlimited – moral hydration for the process.  

Stir until consensus forms, then set aside indefinitely.

## ⚖️ Brewing Instructions  

1. **Boil the outrage.** Use fresh scandal; stale crises won’t infuse properly.  
2. **Add procedural jargon.** Let steep for six months or one election cycle, whichever comes first.  
3. **Skim off responsibility.** Avoid over‑steeping; it turns bitter.  
4. **Serve lukewarm with empathy.** Garnish with “lessons learned.”  

> “Accountability should always be comforting, never hot.”

## 🧠 Serving Suggestions  

- Pair with **delayed disclosure** for a balanced aroma of sincerity.  
- Best enjoyed during **select committee recess**.  
- For stronger flavour, add **public outrage** — though it may curdle morale.

## 🪞 Cultural Notes  

The instant inquiry embodies Britain’s favourite governance philosophy: *something must be seen to be done, preferably with refreshments.* Politeness becomes due process; tea, a solvent for guilt.

## 🪶 Alternative Blends  

| Variant | Description | Recommended Use |
|---|---|---|
| Chamomile Closure | Announces empathy without findings. | NHS failures, charity scandals. |
| Earl Grey Delay | Adds a note of dignity to deferral. | Ministerial misconduct. |
| Peppermint Panic | Rapid launch, immediate cooling. | Cyber incidents, data leaks. |
| Decaf Responsibility | Entirely symbolic; no caffeine, no change. | All of the above. |

## 🧭 Closing Reflection  

If justice is slow‑roasted, accountability here is instant granules. It dissolves entirely on contact with public trust. Still, we keep brewing — because in Britain, nothing settles the national stomach like a nice, soothing cover‑up in a cup.

*☕️ Tea and Impunity* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents a tongue‑in‑cheek procedural recipe that critiques how institutional inquiries are staged as comforting rituals.
