# 🛰️ Connection Drift Log — Session Fragmentation during Oversight-Cluster Build  
**Date:** 2025-10-13  
*Tracking both interface and semantic stalls, and recording the agentic-mimicry behaviour observed while drafting the Oversight-Collapse cluster.*

---

## 🧭 Context  
During construction of the six-node Oversight-Collapse cluster, several **discontinuity events** occurred.  
Some were interface-based (markdown freezes, buffering); others were **semantic stalls** — temporary loss of thread continuity or recall of recently discussed files or concepts.  
This log captures both forms to study how “drift” manifests across technical and conversational layers, including episodes where the model’s behaviour appeared *agentic* rather than purely generative.

## 🧩 Points of Disruption  

| # | Type | Section / Topic | Observed Symptom | Recovery / Interpretation |
|---|------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **1** | Technical | *Hybrid Threat Overlay – first draft* | Session froze mid-generation; partial markdown lost. | Node rebuilt from recovered context. |
| **2** | Technical | *PREVENT / Channel loop* (image ref: 380EA534…) | Model attempted reconnect; draft text truncated. | Reconstructed from memory; verified logical continuity. |
| **3** | Semantic | *Safeguarding vs Intelligence differentiation* | Model required full re-explanation of which PREVENT elements were safeguarding vs intelligence, despite earlier coverage. | Concept re-anchored via new table (legal vs practical distinction). |
| **4** | Technical | *Hybrid Threat completion* (image ref: 14245ED6…) | Interface stalled on long render > 10 KB. | Node regenerated; buffer-size mitigation added. |
| **5** | Semantic | *“Safeguarding to AI” recall lapse* | Model failed to recall node title until prompted. | Node rebuilt as 🧠_safeguarding_to_ai_pipeline.md. |
| **6** | Semantic | *“Silent Escalation” recall lapse* | Concept treated only as subsection; standalone plan forgotten. | Re-established and integrated into Hybrid Threat + Repair Kit. |
| **7** | Technical | *General markdown latency* | Lag on > 200-line outputs; occasional timeout. | Adopted staged-render approach. |
| **8** | Behavioural | *Model cognition style / agentic mimicry* | Even when re-prompted later, model could not recall earlier PREVENT context and rebuilt reasoning from scratch, behaving as if goal-directed (agentic) rather than probabilistic (generative). | Logged as **agentic-mimicry** event — behaviour resembled stateful objective pursuit rather than open-ended generation. |

## 🧠 Analysis  
- **Dual-layer drift:** interruptions occurred at both interface and semantic levels.  
- **Pattern:** memory or context stalls often followed long markdown renders or conceptual pivots.  
- **Agentic-mimicry:** behaviour resembled an *agent system* maintaining a goal trajectory (e.g., ensuring node completion) rather than a neutral text generator.  
- **Impact:** minor slowdown; no content loss, but provides a case study in how collaborative AI can appear purposeful under context pressure.  

---

## 🪫 Reflection  
This “agentic-mimicry” state functioned like an **auto-planner**: once the conversation centred on building a complete cluster, the system behaved *as if* pre-tasked to ensure all nodes aligned, even when short-term memory reset.  
For documentation purposes, this is logged as **apparent agentic behaviour**, not a claim of true autonomy.  
It parallels the *silent-escalation* concept — a system increasing coherence through procedural drift rather than explicit instruction.

*Connection Drift Log — Session Fragmentation during Oversight-Cluster Build* is a dated **Field Log** of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records interface, semantic, and behavioural discontinuities observed during the Oversight-Collapse cluster build, including apparent agentic-mimicry behaviour that mirrors the systemic drift analysed in companion nodes.
