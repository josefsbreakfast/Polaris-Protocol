# 🎭 The Performance of Consensus — Gendered Denial in Online-Harms Governance  
**First created:** 2025-11-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-01  
*How institutional politeness and moral performance let harmful assumptions pass as ethical agreement.*
<!--Insert Death of Stalin joke here.-->

## 🧭 Orientation  
In mixed-gender governance spaces on online-harms or CVE programmes, consensus often forms around *performing disgust* rather than confronting prevalence.  
Everyone agrees that violent or strangulation pornography is “awful.”  
But that agreement becomes a shield: it allows men to look principled, women to feel heard, and no one to admit that the material is statistically ordinary.  
This dynamic births the **policy paradox**—tools are designed for outliers while the behaviour in question is mainstream.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Performative consensus:** agreement built for optics, not realism.  
- **Gendered politeness:** women mistake surface support for structural alignment.  
- **Shame distortion:** men deny participation, skewing prevalence perception.  
- **Reversal paradox:** the one man voicing realism appears misogynistic by comparison.

## 🔍 1. The Politeness Mechanism  
1. Men perform allyship through moral condemnation of violent porn.  
2. Women interpret that as good-faith support.  
3. The room achieves comfort without accuracy.  
4. Realistic objections—“most men have seen this”—are read as vulgar or defensive.  

The result is a governance culture allergic to empiricism.

## ⚙️ 2. Consequences for Policy Design  
- **False rarity:** tools are tuned to detect “deviants” rather than cultural norms.  
- **Algorithmic error:** classifiers built on rare features misfire across the majority population.  
- **Ethical isolation:** women with trauma awareness are sidelined as “too emotional.”  
- **Mislabelled dissent:** empirically minded men are cast as regressive for breaking the performance.

## 🧠 3. Structural Factors  
| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Shame & respectability politics** | Repress truthful discussion of male sexual culture. |
| **Professional risk** | No one wants to be quoted acknowledging mainstream violent porn. |
| **Virtue-signalling incentives** | Moral posturing reads better in funding and press releases than nuance. |

## 🧭 4. Governance Repair  
1. **Open with prevalence data.**  Start meetings with real statistics; kill the illusion of rarity.  
2. **Normalise discomfort.**  Replace “we all agree” with “we are complicit.”  
3. **Facilitate trauma-informed debate.**  Co-chair with survivors or clinicians trained in sexual-violence discourse.  
4. **Protect epistemic dissent.**  Frame realism as data literacy, not misogyny.  
5. **Record rationale, not just outcome.**  Minutes should document contested assumptions, not just unanimous votes.

*The Performance of Consensus* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It captures how moral performance and gendered etiquette distort online-harms governance, turning realism into risk.
