**First created:** 2025-11-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*When international relations are rewritten in the language of condolence.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
From the 2010 Smolensk crash to the 2023 Wagner jet, plane disasters have doubled as geopolitical punctuation marks. Each crash redraws alliances, reframes hostility, or buys time. Diplomatic statements become performances of grief that hide bargaining positions. **Death becomes an instrument of foreign policy.**  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Condolence as strategy:** messaging the world through tragedy.  
- **Ambiguity as leverage:** unclear causes preserve diplomatic optionality.  
- **Shared mourning as temporary détente.**

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Smolensk — Alliance by Absence  
Poland’s lost delegation turned into a decade of suspicion. Moscow’s investigation became a slow-burn hostage situation; cooperation itself became evidence of guilt.  

### 2. Tver — Message to Mercenaries  
The Wagner jet’s explosion was a telegram written in wreckage: loyalty ends at altitude. Abroad, silence signalled stability; inside, fear recalibrated obedience.  

### 3. Diplomatic Necrology  
Foreign ministries maintain lists of the dead as quietly as they maintain visa quotas. Grief is a dataset; condolences are policy updates.
