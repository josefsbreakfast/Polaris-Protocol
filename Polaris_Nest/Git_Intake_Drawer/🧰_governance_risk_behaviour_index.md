# 🧰 Governance Risk Behaviour Index  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*A classification system for understanding how public bodies shift into recognisable risk behaviours — Freeze, Flood, Fog, Fortress, Fragmentation, and Flow — depending on pressure, threat level, and institutional safety.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Governance systems behave predictably under pressure.  
Not because organisations “decide” consciously,  
but because **risk posture produces consistent behavioural modes**.

This index identifies six core governance risk behaviours that appear across:
- councils  
- universities  
- safeguarding teams  
- NHS trusts  
- central government departments  
- police and regulatory bodies  

Each mode shapes:
- decision speed  
- tone of communication  
- procedural rigidity  
- emotional climate  
- support availability  
- misreading or containment of survivors  

This node provides a shared vocabulary for interpreting institutional behaviour.

## ✨ Key Features  
- 6 governance risk behaviour modes  
- how each mode emerges  
- impacts on survivors and staff  
- diagnostic markers  
- integration with freeze, weather, and archetypes nodes  
- a structural rather than personal interpretation of behaviour

## 🧿 Analysis  

# ⭐ The Six Modes

---

## 1️⃣ **Freeze** (High-Pressure Paralysis)  
**Keywords:** immobility, hyper-formalism, caution  
**Trigger:** coercive actors, legal risk, reputational threat  
**Tone:** cold, clipped, procedural  

The institution becomes:
- risk-averse  
- afraid of missteps  
- unwilling to act  
- dependent on committees  

Survivor experience:  
“I’m visible, but no one moves.”

Pairs with:  
- 🔍 Institutional Freeze Patterns  
- ⚖️ Procedural Correctness as Safeguard  

---

## 2️⃣ **Flood** (Overreaction / Hyper-Activity)  
**Keywords:** sudden urgency, panic moves  
**Trigger:** scandal, external oversight, sudden accountability  
**Tone:** alarmed, rapid, sometimes chaotic  

The institution:
- sends multiple emails  
- escalates rapidly  
- triggers simultaneous actions  
- overwhelms or surprises survivors  

Survivor experience:  
“Why did everything suddenly explode?”

Pairs with:  
- 🗼 The Tower (Crisis-Response Mode)  

---

## 3️⃣ **Fog** (Ambiguous Non-Progress)  
**Keywords:** uncertainty, confusion, slow movement  
**Trigger:** unclear leadership, overlapping jurisdictions  
**Tone:** vague, soft, “we’re reviewing”  

The institution:
- delays  
- defers  
- stays noncommittal  
- gives no clarity  
- produces “motion without movement”  

Survivor experience:  
“Everything is happening and nothing is happening.”

Pairs with:  
- 🧠 Institutional Weather Systems  
- 🧿 Credibility Loops  

---

## 4️⃣ **Fortress** (Defensive Legalism)  
**Keywords:** protectionism, silence, adversarial posture  
**Trigger:** anticipated complaints, fear of litigation  
**Tone:** guarded, corporate, formal  

The institution:
- stops sharing information  
- speaks only via legal filters  
- avoids empathy  
- tightens gatekeeping  

Survivor experience:  
“I feel like the enemy.”

Pairs with:  
- 🪆 Containment Logic as Witch Logic  
- 🕯️ Survivor Visibility & Risk Aversion  

---

## 5️⃣ **Fragmentation** (Disowned Responsibility)  
**Keywords:** diffusion, sideways referral, disconnection  
**Trigger:** unclear remit, internal conflict, leadership instability  
**Tone:** “not my department,” decentralised  

The institution:
- passes the case laterally  
- avoids central accountability  
- fractures into sub-teams with no unifying narrative  
- replicates old harms through miscommunication  

Survivor experience:  
“I’m being bounced around like a parcel.”

Pairs with:  
- 🧵 Family Suspicion Patterns (mirroring)  
- 🧩 Bureaucratic Behaviour Archetypes (Fog Machine / Mirror Pool)  

---

## 6️⃣ **Flow** (Safe, Predictable Movement)  
**Keywords:** clarity, stability, human tone  
**Trigger:** low pressure, clear procedure, safe environment  
**Tone:** straightforward, warm, competent  

The institution:
- responds quickly  
- shows empathy  
- improvises safely  
- resolves issues  
- appears coherent and humane  

Survivor experience:  
“Oh. This is what normal looks like.”

Pairs with:  
- 🧠 Institutional Weather Systems (sunlight)  
- 🏛️ Soft Clerk archetype

## 📊 Behaviour Matrix  

| Mode | Speed | Tone | Risk Posture | Survivor Experience |
|------|-------|------|--------------|----------------------|
| Freeze | 0 | cold | high-threat | invisible + stuck |
| Flood | 10 | alarmed | reactive | overwhelmed |
| Fog | 2 | vague | uncertain | disoriented |
| Fortress | 1 | guarded | adversarial | blamed/avoided |
| Fragmentation | 3 | inconsistent | decentralised | bounced |
| Flow | 7 | warm | safe | held + supported |

## Diagnostic Questions  
To identify current governance mode, ask:

- Are decisions fast, slow, or stalled?  
- Is communication warm, neutral, or defensive?  
- Are staff improvising or ritualistic?  
- Does responsibility move forward or sideways?  
- Are people acting from fear, uncertainty, or stability?  

The mode explains the behaviour.
