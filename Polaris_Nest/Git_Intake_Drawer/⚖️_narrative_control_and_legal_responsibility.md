# ⚖️ Narrative Control and Legal Responsibility  
**First created:** 2025-11-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-04  
*When a “line to take” crosses from communications management into obstruction.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node examines what happens when a pre-approved organisational story leaves the press office and enters the justice system.  
Within internal communications, “consistent messaging” is routine.  
Once that message is repeated to police, regulators, or courts, it becomes **evidence**—and the people who repeat or design it acquire legal duties that override loyalty to the institution.

## 🧩 Key Principles  

### 1. Individual Responsibility  
Everyone who provides information in a legal context is personally accountable for its truthfulness.  
- **Knowingly misleading investigators** can constitute *perverting the course of justice* (common law) or *perjury* (if under oath).  
- “I was told to say this” is not a defence if the person knew it was wrong.  
- Even an internal email sent with awareness that it will inform a police report can carry liability.

### 2. Corporate and Managerial Liability  
When senior figures or advisers instruct staff to repeat a false or incomplete version, responsibility widens:  
- Directing or encouraging others to mislead investigators can be prosecuted as **conspiracy to pervert the course of justice**.  
- Producing false records or statements to disguise wrongdoing can amount to **false accounting** or **obstruction**.  
- Lawyers and accountants face **professional-conduct sanctions** for enabling or concealing deception.

### 3. Investigators’ Duties  
Police and regulators are expected to test organisational consistency:  
- Multiple witnesses giving identical language may indicate coaching.  
- Investigators should take independent statements without management present.  
- Notes of any “approved wording” are evidential and can be subpoenaed.

### 4. Intent vs. Mistake  
Minor discrepancies between memories are normal; intent is the differentiator.  
When a person raises that their recollection conflicts with the official script and is told to “stick to it,” the organisation has crossed from risk management into **narrative control**—a justice risk.

## 🧠 Practical Guidance  

| Scenario | Proper Conduct | Red Flags |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Internal briefing before interviews | Ensure participants understand facts already verified; remind them not to speculate. | Coaching or rehearsing identical phrasing for all witnesses. |
| Drafting written statements | Encourage accuracy and completeness. | Editing out inconvenient facts to “align messaging.” |
| Legal or regulatory inquiry | Provide independent statements through official channels. | Managers or lawyers filtering what staff may tell investigators. |
| Discovery of inconsistencies | Re-interview, correct record, disclose amendments. | Suppressing contradictions or punishing staff for mentioning them. |

> Some of that wording does not fully reflect my recollection.  
> I am therefore submitting this statement as my independent version.  
>
