# 🔬 Lost Checks and Balances  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Explores how individuals who might have provided ethical dissent or oversight were nudged away from panels and committees during the early behavioural insights rollout (2012–2016), reducing scrutiny and distorting the public record.*

## 🌐 Summary  
Checks and balances in governance depend on the presence of strong, ethically minded individuals on panels, committees, and advisory boards. Between 2012–2016, when behavioural insights were being scaled into public policy, there are signs that such individuals were **absent, displaced, or nudged away**. This created quieter rooms, softer consensus, and fewer recorded red flags.

---

## 📍 Who These Groups Were (roles, not names)  
- **Ethics committee members** (university, NHS, NIHR, independent panels).  
- **Parliamentary witnesses and advisors** (House of Lords Science & Technology, Commons committees, NICE consultations).  
- **Professional regulators’ board members** (GMC, BMA, Law Society, teaching councils).  
- **Academics at the “edges” of behavioural science** (health, law, equity specialists).  

---

## 📍 What Was at Stake (2012–2016)  
- Early behavioural pilots on health, diet, alcohol, smoking, and organ donation.  
- Policy translation from small lab findings into population-level interventions.  
- Ethical scrutiny on risks: coercion, discrimination, population harms.  
- Public committees and consultations that would shape the record for future oversight.  

---

## 📍 How Absence Functions  
- **Nudging away:** subtle displacement via funding, contract non-renewal, or professional diversion.  
- **Geographic moves:** individuals relocated out of London/Cambridge policy hubs.  
- **Role reshuffling:** appointments not renewed; external experts not re-invited.  
- **Result:** committees and panels lose dissenting voices, shifting tone toward consensus.  

---

## 📍 Why It Matters  
- **Public record distortion:** committee minutes show agreement where strong dissent might once have been voiced.  
- **Oversight weakened:** fewer people to ask hard ethical questions, e.g., *“does this resemble coercion or worse?”*  
- **Systemic vulnerability:** absence of checks makes it easier for malicious or careless actors to exploit weak evidential standards.  
- **Downstream risk:** harms scale invisibly when dissent is displaced rather than debated.

*Lost Checks and Balances* is a Big Picture Protocol node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how the absence of dissenting individuals in 2012–2016 undermined scrutiny and distorted the policy record on behavioural insights.
