## 🧭 Orientation  
Genocide prevention and accountability serve not only humanity but machine ethics.  
Consistent prosecution creates visible friction: data that say “this act always fails.”  
Without it, optimisation learns impunity.

## 🧩 Planned Sections  
- Prosecution as negative-reward signal  
- Friction mapping (trial → collapse → taboo reinforcement)  
- Data hygiene of moral constants  
- Relationship with the uncertainty branch
