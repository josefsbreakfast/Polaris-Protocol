*Countermeasures to the digital sludge: algorithms, incentives, and cooperative clean-ups.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
“Sludge” describes the friction, junk content, and manipulative architectures that make the web unusable.  
This node explores **systemic fixes** — not just better filters, but governance models that shift incentives away from sludge production.

## 🧩 Diagnostic Snapshot  
| Layer | Source of Sludge | Example | Countermeasure |
|-------|------------------|----------|----------------|
| Algorithmic | Engagement optimisation | clickbait farms | cooperative ranking models |
| Economic | Ad-driven incentives | SEO spam, affiliate loops | public interest funding pools |
| Cognitive | Overload + fatigue | doomscrolling | humane defaults, pacing nudges |
| Institutional | Capture by few platforms | search monopolies | antitrust, open-index mandates |

## 🧭 Sidebar: Hypothetical Cooperative / Public-Run Models  

### 🏛 Cooperative Search  
A **public-service search engine**, run as a civic utility (think “BBC of Search”), indexed transparently, weighted toward public knowledge over ad revenue.  

### 🧩 Federation Sandboxes  
Regional networks for schools or libraries — shared moderation councils, open APIs, zero-ad content, learning-through-maintenance.  

### 🪞 Public Verification Pools  
Crowdsourced metadata auditing: citizens validate claims, with visible provenance graphs; stored in commons rather than corporate silos.  

### 🌍 Algorithmic Transparency Commons  
Shared repository of recommendation datasets, so researchers and publics can inspect bias and retrain filters cooperatively.

## 🌌 Constellations  
💧 🪞 🧠 ⚖️ — Belongs to the repair and transparency register.
