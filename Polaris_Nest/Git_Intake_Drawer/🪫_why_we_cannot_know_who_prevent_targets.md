# 🪫 Why We Cannot Know Who Prevent Targets  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How the Prevent/Channel architecture is designed to hide who is being screened, triaged, flagged, discussed, or classified — creating an epistemic blackout that makes racialised harm invisible.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
The most important fact about Prevent is also the least understood:

### **We cannot know who it targets.**

Not because no one has looked.  
Not because the data is “difficult.”  
Not because the system is new.

We cannot know because:

- the law forbids disclosure,  
- the system is constructed to prevent scrutiny,  
- the data is held inside counterterrorism exemptions,  
- Channel panels publish nothing,  
- police triage is invisible,  
- metadata screening produces no record accessible to the public,  
- refused referrals are not reported,  
- screened-but-dismissed cases are uncounted.

Prevent is a **statistical black hole** by design.

---

## 🧩 Structural Analysis  

### **1. CTSA 2015 places Prevent under counterterrorism secrecy**  
Prevent is embedded in a legal regime that:

- refuses FOI requests,  
- hides aggregate data,  
- blocks case-level analysis,  
- prevents public oversight.

This makes racialised patterns impossible to verify — or challenge.

---

### **2. Most Prevent activity is never recorded publicly**  
Only a fraction of Prevent activity becomes:

- recorded referrals,  
- Channel cases,  
- published statistics.

Hidden Prevent (digital screening, officer triage, metadata flags) is:

- secret,  
- unrecorded,  
- unreported,  
- legally protected by CT exemptions.

We cannot count what we cannot see.

---

### **3. Triaged-out cases form the majority — and are never disclosed**  
Most Prevent “cases” never become formal referrals.

Police Prevent teams conduct:

- quiet reviews,  
- silent checks,  
- digital profiling,  
- contextual data sweeps.

If dismissed, nothing is published.

Entire populations can be screened without trace.

---

### **4. Channel panels publish nothing—not even membership**  
Channel panels disclose no:

- minutes,  
- outcomes,  
- racial breakdowns,  
- case notes,  
- triage reasons,  
- refusals,  
- locations.

In a democracy, a committee that makes decisions about citizens must be visible.  
Channel is not.

---

### **5. Counterterrorism exemptions override GDPR rights**  
Individuals cannot:

- access metadata used in screening,  
- see risk scores,  
- obtain full Prevent notes,  
- learn reasons for classification,  
- understand how they were triaged.

Without access rights, targeted populations remain invisible — even to themselves.

---

### **6. Institutions participating in Prevent are gagged**  
Teachers, clinicians, and universities are frequently told:

- not to disclose Prevent interactions,  
- not to inform families,  
- not to describe police requests.

This blocks public awareness of how large the system is.

---

## 🧪 Case Window (Patterns)

*Synthesised from FOI refusals, parliamentary commentary, academic studies — no personal data.*

- FOIs rejected on national security grounds.  
- Local authorities unable to share Prevent demographic data.  
- NHS trusts prohibited from releasing Prevent case details.  
- Universities keeping Prevent logs internally only.  
- Police refusing to disclose screening numbers.  
- Racialised communities reporting referral clusters with no official data to confirm them.

The absence of data *is the data.*

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• A system that hides itself cannot be accountable**  
Democracy requires visibility.

### **• Harm becomes unmeasurable**  
If racialised patterns exist — and they do — the system is designed so we cannot prove them.

### **• Citizens cannot challenge unknown decisions**  
Black boxes produce fear, not safety.

### **• The state governs through epistemic asymmetry**  
They know everything about you.  
You know nothing about them.

### **• This is incompatible with democratic legitimacy**  
Democracy dies when secrecy becomes default.
