**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How extremist ideology disguises itself inside Westminster aesthetics.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node maps the **semiotic camouflage** used when alt‑right actors enter Westminster‑adjacent spaces. Instead of overt hostility, they arrive cloaked in:

- conservative respectability  
- academic seriousness  
- policy language  

It is the costume layer of the Wolf of Westminster.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Adoption of Westminster aesthetics by extremists.  
- Polite veneer masking authoritarian content.  
- Legitimacy by adjacency to respectable speakers and venues.  
- British politeness as an exploited vulnerability.  
- Early cues that the “clothing” and the content don’t match.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Clothing, Tone, Accent  
The Wolf appears as:

- a man in a navy suit  
- calm, measured voice  
- conference badge and notebook  

The signals say: “safe, serious, one of us.”

### 2. Intellectual Vocabulary as Cover  
Key phrases:

- “civilisational confidence”  
- “national decline”  
- “uncomfortable truths”  
- “post‑liberal renewal”  

These sound philosophical while seeding panic.

### 3. Institutional Proximity  
Events feature:

- MPs  
- academics  
- clerics  
- journalists  

An extremist speaker slotted among them borrows their credibility.

### 4. Mask‑Slip Moments  
Watch for:

- sudden “enemies within” talk  
- demographic fear narratives  
- applause at punitive or exclusionary lines  
- references to known far‑right thinkers as if they were mainstream  

These are the seams where the costume splits.
