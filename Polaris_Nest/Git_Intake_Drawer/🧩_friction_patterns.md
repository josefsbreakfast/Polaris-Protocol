*Micro-resistances in digital interaction — and what they reveal about human emotion, cognition, and context.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
“Friction patterns” refer to the tiny moments of resistance or dissonance that appear when a person interacts with digital systems.

They occur when the nervous system and the interface are slightly out of sync:

- hesitation  
- re-scrolling  
- backtracking  
- stuttering navigation  
- overcorrection  
- unexpected pauses  

Friction is not a flaw.  
It is the **human signature** in a digital environment.

## 🔧 Examples of Friction  
- Swiping too fast, then reversing  
- Opening a notification, then immediately closing it  
- Re-reading the same sentence twice  
- Typing, deleting, typing again  
- Hesitating over a button  
- Sudden changes in scroll speed  
- The “ugh” micro-pause before replying  
- The “I need to re-check that” bounce  

These are emotional and cognitive markers — **not diagnostic tools**.

---

## 🌡️ What Friction Patterns Actually Reflect  
- uncertainty  
- emotional activation  
- interest  
- discomfort  
- surprise  
- stress  
- delight  
- fatigue  
- cognitive overload  
- habit-breaking moments  

Every interaction becomes a **map of where the mind snagged**.

## 🚫 What Friction Does *Not* Indicate  
- pathology  
- surveillance  
- risk  
- intent  
- deception  
- mental health condition  

Friction is just **the physics of attention**.

## 📚 Why Polaris Uses This Concept  
Friction patterns help explain:

- why systems misinterpret human behaviour  
- how emotional activation creates behavioural residue  
- why hostile actors accidentally broadcast their state through interaction styles  
- why transparency works better than secrecy  
- why digital systems feel like mirrors, not watchers

Understanding friction patterns allows Polaris to articulate the **non-threatening, ordinary mechanics** of metadata.

*Friction Patterns* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It describes the ordinary micro-resistances of digital behaviour and how they shape interaction without implying surveillance or diagnostic interpretation.
