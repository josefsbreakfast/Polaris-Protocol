# 🔥 Hunger Strike Comparisons  
**First created:** 2025-12-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-18  
*What hunger strikes across history reveal about democracy, coercion, and state tolerance of death.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node compares hunger strikes across different political contexts — including suffragettes, Irish republican prisoners, and contemporary detainees — to identify **repeating governance responses**, not to collapse distinct struggles.

The comparison is structural, not moral.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Hunger strikes as last-resort democratic speech  
- Repetition of state delay tactics  
- Mockery as precursor to harm  
- Retrospective mourning vs real-time dismissal  

---

## 🪻 Suffragettes (Early 20th Century)  
- Hunger strikes used to resist criminalisation  
- Force-feeding widely employed  
- Starvation reframed as “choice”  
- Public ridicule normalised state violence  

---

## ☘️ Irish Hunger Strikes (20th Century)  
- Framed as fanaticism rather than protest  
- Delay justified through “personal responsibility” rhetoric  
- Deaths later mourned, rarely prevented  

---

## ⛓️ Contemporary Hunger Strikers  
- Often on remand or prolonged detention  
- Hunger strikes framed as manipulation  
- Escalation delayed under “risk management” language  
- Compassion deferred until after irreversible harm  

---

## 🔁 The Pattern  
Across cases:
- starvation is reframed as voluntary,
- responsibility is displaced,
- delay is normalised,
- and deaths are later called “tragic”.

This is not coincidence.  
It is a governance script.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🔥 Hunger Strike Comparisons* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It exists to make repetition visible before it becomes fatal.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
