# 📨 FOI Draft — Safeguards Against Allied Cybersecurity Abuse  
**First created:** 2025-10-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-26  
*Suggested FOI wording to request UK Government assurances on citizen data protection in allied cybersecurity cooperation, with reference to Israel’s Emergency Regulations (Defence) 1945 and related emergency-powers frameworks.*

---

## 🌱 Scope  

This note provides a model **Freedom of Information (FOI) request** seeking transparency on how the UK Government safeguards its citizens from being profiled, targeted, or harmed through **allied cyber-security or emergency-powers collaboration**—particularly where a partner state has publicly framed dissent or protest as terrorism.  
It integrates reference to the **Israeli Emergency Regulations (Defence) 1945**, originally enacted under the British Mandate, to examine whether that legacy emergency-powers logic could be imported into UK cooperation frameworks.

## 🧾 Suggested FOI Request  

> **To:** Cabinet Office (copied to the Home Office and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology)  
>  
> **Subject:** Freedom of Information Request – UK Safeguards on Allied Cybersecurity Operations and Emergency Powers  

---

### Request  

Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, please provide the following information:

1. **Safeguard Frameworks**  
   - Details of any internal policies, memoranda of understanding, or ministerial directions governing cooperation between the UK and the State of Israel (or its contractors) on cybersecurity, intelligence sharing, or emergency-powers enforcement.  
   - Any clauses that protect UK citizens’ data or communications from foreign-state interception, classification, or targeting.  
   - Copies of any memoranda, contracts, or data-exchange agreements that reference or operate under Israeli legislation deriving from the **Emergency Regulations (Defence) 1945** or any successor *Emergency Powers* laws currently invoked by the Government of Israel.  
   - Confirmation of whether the UK Government has assessed how cooperation conducted under those powers could expose UK citizens to treatment equivalent to that authorised under such emergency legislation (e.g., administrative detention, black-listing, or censorship).

2. **Risk Assessments and Reviews**  
   - Copies or summaries of risk or impact assessments (including Equality or Human Rights Impact Assessments) conducted since 2023 concerning cyber-security or data-sharing collaboration with Israeli public or private sector entities.  
   - Records of any Cabinet Office, NCSC, or Home Office reviews into possible exposure of UK citizens to harm, intimidation, or unlawful surveillance arising from such cooperation.  
   - Copies of any assessments considering the **extra-territorial application of allied emergency-powers regimes**, including but not limited to the Israeli *Emergency Regulations (Defence) 1945* and subsequent amendments.

3. **Safeguard Mechanisms for Protest and Expression**  
   - Any guidance, legal advice, or ministerial correspondence addressing how UK citizens’ rights to protest, association, and expression are protected in digital-surveillance contexts, particularly where allied governments have designated certain protest movements as hostile or terrorist-affiliated.  

4. **Oversight and Accountability**  
   - Which UK oversight bodies (e.g., Investigatory Powers Commissioner, Information Commissioner, or Parliamentary committees) are responsible for ensuring allied cybersecurity activity does not result in discriminatory or politically motivated data treatment of UK residents.  

Please include any documentation, internal audit outcomes, or correspondence that clarifies **what the UK Government is doing to protect its citizens’ data and reputational security** in light of allied states’ offensive-cyber declarations and emergency-powers legislation.

---

### Clarification  

This request is motivated by documented public statements from Israeli officials describing current cybersecurity posture as an “offensive” operation and framing global dissent as potential support for terrorism.  
Given the UK’s extensive trade and defence partnerships with Israeli firms in the cyber and intelligence sectors, there is a strong public interest in understanding **what safeguards prevent such designations or data exchanges from being applied to UK citizens** exercising lawful expression.  

---

### Ethical and Procedural Note  

This FOI request is submitted in good faith, in a **measured, lawful, and procedural manner**.  
Its purpose is not adversarial but protective: to ensure that citizens who engage respectfully with democratic processes—such as providing testimony, submitting evidence, or expressing opposition to genocide—are not algorithmically or administratively categorised as security threats through allied data-sharing mechanisms.  
The request arises from lived experience of interference and harassment following legitimate testimony given to the King’s Bench Division and subsequent correspondence pursued through proper legal channels.

---

### Preferred Format  

Please provide responses in digital form (PDF or accessible electronic files).  

If any information is withheld, please cite the relevant FOIA exemption and explain why the public interest in disclosure is outweighed.

## ⚖️  Context (Polaris Commentary Block)

> **Background:**  
> The *Defence (Emergency) Regulations 1945* were enacted by the British Mandate and retained by Israel at independence; they authorise preventive detention, censorship, and property seizure.  
> These provisions underpin much of Israel’s military law in the occupied territories and have been cited by UN bodies as components of an apartheid framework.  
> Because they originated in British colonial regulation, the UK bears a continuing interest—and arguably a residual responsibility—in ensuring that such powers or their derivative logics are not mirrored or imported through modern cybersecurity or intelligence cooperation.
