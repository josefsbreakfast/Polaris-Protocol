*Curiosity as integrity audit — when “rule-breaking” is really system diagnostics.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Some people don’t test limits to rebel; they test them to *see the system clearly*.  
The Wall-Tester instinct is the impulse to poke at structures — rules, code, fences, or social conventions — simply to map how they actually work.  
It’s curiosity in its purest engineering form: a desire to understand the architecture of control from the inside out.

## ✨ Key Traits  

- **Diagnostic Curiosity** — the need to observe failure points first-hand.  
- **Rule-Bound Scepticism** — acceptance of structure paired with disbelief in its perfection.  
- **Pattern Transference** — the same behaviour appears in code, bureaucracy, and play.  
- **Social Risk** — in one context it’s “experimentation,” in another “non-compliance.”  
- **Moral Motor** — testing is often driven by integrity: if the fence has a hole, fixing it matters more than obeying the sign.

## 🧿 Analysis  
Feynman escaping the army base to test security; a gamer stress-testing level geometry; an analyst probing bureaucracy for leaks — all are versions of the same act.  
The system is treated as a living object: prod it, map the boundaries, report the weak points.  

Wall-Testers expose design truths others prefer to ignore.  
They are the reason protocols evolve and the reason organisations feel uncomfortable.  
They can be disciplined out of institutions that confuse obedience with safety, yet they are essential to any structure that wants to remain honest.  

A mature governance model learns to **design for them** — creating safe channels for testing and reflection rather than punishing curiosity.

*The Wall-Tester Type* is a temperament node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It explores diagnostic curiosity as a civic and psychological force — how the same trait can safeguard integrity or trigger discipline depending on who holds power.
