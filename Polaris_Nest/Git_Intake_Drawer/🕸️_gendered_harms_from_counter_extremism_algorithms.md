# 🕸️ Gendered Harms from Counter-Extremism Algorithms  
**First created:** 2025-11-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-01  
*When automation confuses opposition with allegiance, women’s safety work becomes collateral damage.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Counter-extremism and content-moderation models cluster people by topic, not by intent.  
When “who talks about misogyny” is treated as a single group, outspoken women are twinned with the men who hate them.  
The result: visibility as exposure, not protection.  
This node traces how those misclassifications create diffuse but lethal harms and why UK governance has yet to recognise them as systemic risk.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Topic-not-intent clustering** — critics and perpetrators merged in one dataset.  
- **Engagement weighting** — outrage reads as relevance.  
- **Gender-blind frameworks** — CVE and online-harms regimes ignore adult advocates.  
- **Siloed accountability** — no agency owns cumulative trauma.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 🧮 1. The Mechanism  
1. **Clustering by topic.**  Models group everyone discussing “violence against women” into the same behavioural cohort.  
2. **Engagement reward.**  Hostile responses boost ranking, pushing advocates into abusers’ feeds.  
3. **Feedback entrenchment.**  Repetition trains the classifier that the pairing is correct.  
4. **Human-review absence.**  No manual process checks whether exposure equals endangerment.  

Each outspoken woman becomes a stabilising node inside a hostile ecosystem.

### 🧩 2. The Policy Blind Spot — Siloed Accountability and Invisible Harm  
1. **Siloed accountability.**  
   - CVE programmes see *content*, not people.  
   - Police see *crime*, not digital provenance.  
   - Regulators see *data*, not mental-health outcomes.  
   - Health services see *distress*, not algorithmic cause.  
   Each believes another holds the duty of care.  

2. **Signal dilution.**  
   Abuse fragments across platforms; no single dataset shows the pattern.  

3. **Diagnostic ambiguity.**  
   Burnout and suicidal ideation appear as personal weakness, not systemic output.  

4. **Temporal lag.**  
   Harms surface months after deployment—outside policy review cycles.  

**Result:** foreseeable but untraceable harm—legally invisible until statistical disaster.

---

### ⚖️ 3. Governance Translation  
In regulatory terms:  
- **Foreseeability:** engineers know clustering will expose advocates to hostility.  
- **Traceability:** fragmented oversight means no agency can prove causation.  
That gap enables collective denial.

### 🧭 4. Integrated Harm Attribution (IHA) — Governance Fix  

| Function | Custodian | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Cross-silo data correlation | ICO / Ofcom joint unit | Detect harassment loops across platforms |
| Psychosocial triage | NHS Public Health + DCMS | Classify cumulative online trauma as a public-health indicator |
| Safety liaison | Home Office / Law Enforcement | Link harassment evidence to data-provenance chains |
| Accountability synthesis | Cabinet Office Resilience Directorate | Publish annual **Digital Harms State of the Nation** report |

Turning “vague harms” into a measurable, reportable pattern converts moral failure into legal obligation.

### 💫 5. Legal and Policy Duties  
- **Human Rights Act 1998 / ECHR Articles 2, 3, 10** — duty to protect life, security, and expression.  
- **Equality Act 2010** — indirect discrimination where women bear disproportionate harm.  
- **UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders** — protection of those who expose violence.  
Failure to anticipate secondary harm from algorithmic clustering is breach, not oversight.

---

### 🪞 6. Implementation Steps  
1. Mandatory **gender-segmented risk testing** in all CVE and moderation algorithms.  
2. **Psychological-safety clauses** in procurement and evaluation contracts.  
3. **Joint ICO–Ofcom rapid-response mechanism** for algorithmic harassment cases.  
4. **Annual publication** of gender-specific digital-harm statistics.

*Gendered Harms from Counter-Extremism Algorithms* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how automated moderation and counter-extremism tools misclassify advocacy as risk, reproducing structural misogyny through data logic.
