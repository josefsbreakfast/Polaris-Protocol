## field note: double-noise meetings  

the table is long.  
grief sits outside the room,  
while inside two registers of noise collide:  

- **spectacle noise** →  
  speeches, headlines, think-tank lines.  
  the polished narrative that travels fast,  
  all certainty, all stage-light.  

- **procedural noise** →  
  minutes, acronyms, safeguarding reviews.  
  a flood of neutral-sounding words  
  that make decisions irreversible  
  before they are even named.  

together, the noises weave a cover.  
not silence — never silence.  
but a hum that drowns survivors out,  
turning testimony into “case notes,”  
turning riots into “risk assessments,”  
turning deaths into “lessons learned.”  

the handlers at the table  
do not argue over truth.  
they argue over *phrasing*.  
because phrasing decides what gets archived,  
and the archive decides what can be denied.  

the real séance is outside the door,  
where absence waits to be spoken.

## 🗂️ noise_glossary  

- **Spectacle Noise**  
  register: external, amplified, fast-moving.  
  form: speeches, headlines, think-tank lines.  
  effect: dominates public perception,  
  frames events as simplified narratives.  
  polaris equivalent: ✈️ distraction flare.  

- **Procedural Noise**  
  register: internal, bureaucratic, slow but heavy.  
  form: minutes, safeguarding reviews, acronyms.  
  effect: drowns out lived experience with “neutral” language,  
  fixes outcomes before dissent can surface.  
  polaris equivalent: 🗄️ archive overwrite.  

- **Double-Noise**  
  when spectacle and procedural noise run in tandem.  
  one dazzles, the other cements.  
  together they form a containment field,  
  leaving no air for survivor testimony.  
  polaris equivalent: 🔒 narrative lock.
