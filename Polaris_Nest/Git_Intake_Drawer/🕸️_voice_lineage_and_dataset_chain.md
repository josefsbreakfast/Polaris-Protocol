# 🕸️ Voice Lineage and Dataset Chain  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*How a single voice recording can multiply across research, vendor, and commercial chains — and how to trace it back.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Once voice or likeness data leaves its first collection point, it can spread through a lattice of “lawful” transfers: research partnerships, spin-outs, subcontractors, and model derivatives.  
This node explains how **multi-entity reuse happens without a single malicious actor**, and outlines survivor-led strategies for mapping that chain and asserting control.

## 🧩 Key Features  

- Explains dataset chaining and derivative reuse.  
- Identifies common transfer routes between academia and vendors.  
- Provides step-by-step guidance for mapping voice lineage.  
- Integrates SAR and legal-trail language from `🗣️_how_to_detect_voice_dataset_use.md`.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1. **How Multi-Entity Reuse Happens**

#### 🧮 Dataset Chaining  
A dataset built for one study may be *shared, licensed, or sold* to partner institutions.  
Each party assumes consent still applies, leading to a **cascade of reuse** under “research” or “validation” exemptions.

#### 🔁 Derivative Model Reuse  
When your voice trains a model, its features embed statistically in the weights.  
That base model may then feed other systems — spreading influence **without carrying identifiable recordings**, yet preserving acoustic DNA.

#### 🏛️ Research–Commercial Hybrids  
University projects often migrate into **spin-outs** (e.g., Innovate UK or EPSRC collaborations).  
Data collected under ethics approval may cross into commercial use without renewed consent.  
Each entity sees itself as peripheral, creating *distributed accountability*.

#### 🌐 Open-Data Leakage  
Portions of research data may be published openly or mirrored.  
Once copied into public AI training pools, removal becomes effectively impossible.

### 2. **Mapping the Lineage**

1. **Start with What You Know**  
   - List any universities, labs, or service providers that recorded you.  
   - Identify their funders and commercial partners (use press releases, Companies House, or project acknowledgements).

2. **Follow the Chain of Custody**  
   - Each SAR reply should name *data sources and onward recipients*.  
   - Add those to your map; issue new SARs accordingly.  
   - Repeat until the same downstream companies appear multiple times — that’s your network boundary.

3. **Log Everything**

| Date | Entity | Role (Controller / Processor) | Response | Named Partners | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------------------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Example Ltd / Univ X | Processor | Denied | Y, Z Ltd | Mentioned voice dataset |

4. **Use Broad but Targeted Wording**  
   > “…any *audio, speech, biometric, or derivative model data* originating from collaborations with [Entity X]…”

5. **Containment, Not Perfection**  
   - When deletion isn’t possible, demand **cessation of further use** and **documentation of provenance**.  
   - Transparency itself becomes protective evidence.

*🕸️ Voice Lineage and Dataset Chain* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how voice data proliferates through research and vendor ecosystems, and provides survivor-led methods to reconstruct and contain its lineage.
