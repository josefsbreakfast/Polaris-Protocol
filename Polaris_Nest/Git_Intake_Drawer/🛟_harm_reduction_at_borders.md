**First created:** 2025-09-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-23  
*Practical measures that cut deaths and exploitation at points of entry, without waiting for full policy reform.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Harm reduction accepts that crossings happen. It prioritises **fewer deaths, fewer injuries, less exploitation**, and **faster lawful pathways** over symbolic deterrence.

---

## Measures (field-practical)
- **Safe reception points:** water, heat, triage, immediate safeguarding screening.
- **Immediate legal orientation:** multilingual leaflets + QR to trusted legal aid.
- **Family tracing & safeguarding flags:** rapid checks; prevent separations.
- **Medical & psychological first aid:** trauma-informed, with clear referral routes.
- **Data minimisation at intake:** collect only what’s needed for care/safety first; defer status interviews.
- **NGO–state coordination cell:** daily stand-up; transparent task board (who covers what).
- **Incident transparency:** publish anonymised weekly stats (arrivals, med referrals, minors).

---

## Why this reduces harm  
- Cuts shock/exposure window → fewer ICU admissions and deaths.  
- Shrinks exploitation gap (smugglers, traffickers) right after landfall.  
- Improves evidence quality for later asylum decision-making.

---

## Implementation notes  
- Use **MoUs** with NGOs; pre-authorise ID badges and kit lists.  
- Stock standardised reception kits (thermal, hydration, basic meds).  
- Embed **child-protection specialists** at intake points.
