*Practical measures that cut deaths and exploitation at points of entry, without waiting for full policy reform.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Harm reduction accepts that crossings happen. It prioritises **fewer deaths, fewer injuries, less exploitation**, and **faster lawful pathways** over symbolic deterrence.

---

## Measures (field-practical)
- **Safe reception points:** water, heat, triage, immediate safeguarding screening.
- **Immediate legal orientation:** multilingual leaflets + QR to trusted legal aid.
- **Family tracing & safeguarding flags:** rapid checks; prevent separations.
- **Medical & psychological first aid:** trauma-informed, with clear referral routes.
- **Data minimisation at intake:** collect only what’s needed for care/safety first; defer status interviews.
- **NGO–state coordination cell:** daily stand-up; transparent task board (who covers what).
- **Incident transparency:** publish anonymised weekly stats (arrivals, med referrals, minors).

---

## Why this reduces harm  
- Cuts shock/exposure window → fewer ICU admissions and deaths.  
- Shrinks exploitation gap (smugglers, traffickers) right after landfall.  
- Improves evidence quality for later asylum decision-making.

---

## Implementation notes  
- Use **MoUs** with NGOs; pre-authorise ID badges and kit lists.  
- Stock standardised reception kits (thermal, hydration, basic meds).  
- Embed **child-protection specialists** at intake points.

*Applying harm reduction principles from public health to asylum crossings and migration governance*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Harm reduction begins with a truth: people will undertake risky actions when safer routes are blocked.  
- In substance use, that means recognising overdose risk and providing methadone, naloxone, safe-use spaces.  
- In borders, that means recognising that people will cross seas and borders if they must — and designing policy to reduce death and trauma, not to increase them.

## Practices of Harm Reduction at Borders  

### 1. **Search and Rescue (SAR)**  
- Treat Channel crossings like medical emergencies, not crimes.  
- Fund SAR crews explicitly, rather than “deterrence by neglect.”  
- Save lives first, then process paperwork.  

### 2. **Asylum Access in France / Transit States**  
- Allow claims at UK-linked hubs or embassies to reduce the need for dangerous boat journeys.  
- Partnered processing centres could triage protection vs. inadmissibility before people risk the Channel.  

### 3. **Rapid Paperwork and Screening**  
- Current average wait = 400+ days. Backlogs kill morale and feed contractor profits.  
- Process claims in days/weeks where possible.  
- If someone poses a genuine security threat, identify them quickly and act lawfully.  

### 4. **Safe Humanitarian Visas**  
- Humanitarian visas function like methadone: a safer, regulated path that reduces exploitation by smugglers.  
- Evidence shows safe visas don’t increase arrivals overall — they just reduce deaths.  

### 5. **Health over Carceral Models**  
- Recognise trauma, provide psychosocial support, avoid detention-as-default.  
- Design accommodation for recovery and integration, not containment.  

---

## Why This Matters  
- Current “incompetence” is deliberate design: delays feed private contractors (hotels, escorts, security).  
- Harm reduction flips the logic: if the risk exists, *meet it with care rather than punishment.*  
- It saves lives, lowers costs, reduces exploitation, and honours obligations under the Refugee Convention (Article 31).  

---

## Counterarguments & Rebuttals  
- **“Pull factor” myth**: Harm reduction does not create more crossings. Evidence from drug harm reduction: services reduce harm without increasing use. Same principle applies.  
- **“Criminals will exploit it”**: Rapid screening + international policing already allow dangerous individuals to be flagged. Punishing everyone else only increases risk.
