# 📊 KPIs vs OKRs in Government  
**First created:** 2025-09-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-01  
*A comparative node on measurement logics in UK public services*

## Overview  

This document outlines the tension between **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** and **Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)** as applied to UK government practice.  

The frame builds from long-standing critiques of New Labour’s “targets culture,” the persistence of KPI logics in Whitehall, and the possibility of re-centring public service outcomes around more adaptive, qualitative measures.

## KPI vs OKR Comparison  

| **Feature** | **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)** | **OKR (Objectives & Key Results)** |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Core purpose** | Track narrow performance targets (e.g. % of cases closed within X days). | Link big-picture objectives to measurable progress (e.g. “Improve quality of justice for victims of sexual violence”). |
| **Nature of measures** | Usually quantitative, single-metric, output-based. | Mix of quantitative + qualitative, outcome-focused. |
| **Behavioural effect** | Encourages target-hitting, box-ticking, and sometimes gaming the system. | Encourages alignment with mission, experimentation, and improvement. |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid: once set, they often distort priorities even if context changes. | Adaptive: key results can be adjusted, objectives remain guiding stars. |
| **Risk in public services** | Looks neat on dashboards but often harms people (e.g. patients discharged early to hit waiting-time targets). | Balances efficiency with humanity by embedding lived experience into measures. |
| **Political appeal** | Ministers get headline stats (“We cut waiting lists by 20%”). | Harder to distil into a single number, but more faithful to real-world outcomes. |
| **Example in justice** | KPI: “Reduce average time to trial by 15%.” → May pressure courts to rush cases, undermining fairness. | OKR: “Ensure fair and timely justice for victims and defendants.” Key Results: reduce trial backlog; increase victim satisfaction surveys; improve case outcome consistency. |
| **Example in health** | KPI: “90% of A&E patients seen within 4 hours.” → Can lead to gaming (patients left in corridors until they ‘count’). | OKR: “Provide safe, dignified emergency care.” Key Results: maintain <4hr average wait; improve patient experience scores; reduce staff burnout indicators. |

## Commentary  

- **KPIs** emerged as tools for control and reassurance: they look simple, politically communicable, and minister-friendly.  
- **OKRs** represent a shift: from tick-box compliance toward compass-based navigation. They keep purpose at the centre, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evidence.  
- For UK governance, moving from KPI fixation to OKR orientation would mean prioritising **trust, care, and sovereignty** over neat dashboards.
