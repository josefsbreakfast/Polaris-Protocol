# 🩺 Live Probe Ethics & Extraction Decision Sheet
**First created:** 2025-10-13  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-13  
*One‑page gate for using a real person as a probe, balancing data value with duty of care.*

---

## ✅ Quick Gate (answer in order)  
1. **Immediate harm?** If yes → **EXTRACT NOW**.  
2. **Can provider logs or synthetic probes replace live exposure?** If yes → stop live probe.  
3. **Is telemetry ephemeral/only live?** If yes → consider **short probe (≤72h)**.  
4. **Informed, revocable consent on file?** If no → stop.  
5. **Named approvers (ethics/legal/tech)?** If no → pause.  
6. **Extraction capacity ready (safe space, transport, psych/legal)?** If no and extraction needed → escalate resources now.  
7. **Outcome:** Extract / Short probe (48–72h) / No live probe (use providers/synthetic).

## ⏱️ Timing Defaults  
- Intake & triage: 0–24h.  
- Short probe window: ≤72h, review at 48h.  
- Extended (7–14d): exceptional; requires oversight renewal every 24–48h.  
- >14d: formal programme only (generally avoid).

---

## 🚫 Hard‑Stop Triggers  
Physical threats; doxxing; acute mental‑health risk; credential theft; attacker escalation after contact; legal exposure; consent withdrawn.
