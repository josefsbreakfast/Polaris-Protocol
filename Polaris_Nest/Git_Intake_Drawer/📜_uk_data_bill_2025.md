# Timeline of the UK Data Bill → Data (Use and Access) Act 2025

## 1. Origins & Early Attempts (2022–2024)
- **July 2022**: First *Data Protection and Digital Information Bill* introduced in the Commons (withdrawn after Liz Truss became PM).  
- **March 2023**: Reintroduced as the *No. 2 Bill*.  
- **29 Nov 2023**: Passed all Commons stages.  
- **6 Dec 2023**: Introduced to the House of Lords.  
- **24 Apr 2024**: Completed Lords’ Committee Stage, but lapsed due to prorogation ahead of the general election.  

## 2. Revival as the Data (Use and Access) Bill (DUA Bill)
- **23 Oct 2024**: Resurrected under new name in the Lords.  
- **Oct 2024 – Feb 2025**: Passed Lords’ scrutiny, then sent back to Commons.  

## 3. Lords’ Pushback & AI Copyright Showdown
- **12 May 2025 onwards**: Entered “ping-pong” (Lords/Commons exchanging amendments).  
- **May–June 2025**: Lords, led by crossbench peer Beeban Kidron, repeatedly amended bill to force **AI transparency obligations**.  
- **4 Jun 2025**: Fifth defeat inflicted on government (221–116 vote). Government offered partial concessions.  
- **Public outcry**: Figures like Elton John, Paul McCartney, and creative industries lobby strongly against government’s stance.  

## 4. Passage into Law
- **11 Jun 2025**: Bill finally cleared both Houses after compromise on AI transparency.  
- **19 Jun 2025**: Received Royal Assent → became the **Data (Use and Access) Act 2025**.  
- **Mid–Late 2025**: Phased implementation of provisions (2–12 months).
