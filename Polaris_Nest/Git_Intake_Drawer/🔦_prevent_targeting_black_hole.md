# 🔦 Why We Cannot Know Who Prevent Really Targets  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*How the design of Prevent/Channel creates a statistical, operational, and democratic black hole that makes it structurally impossible to know who is harmed by the system—or how often.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Prevent and Channel operate within a **data vacuum** they themselves generate.

Because of the way CTSA 2015 is written, and because Prevent straddles:

- safeguarding confidentiality,  
- counterterrorism secrecy,  
- multi-agency information-sharing exemptions,  
- non-disclosure rules,  
- unofficial metadata pipelines,

it becomes **impossible** for the public—or even Parliament—to know:

- who gets referred,  
- who gets screened,  
- who gets discussed but not recorded as “referred”,  
- who is misclassified,  
- whose metadata was triaged,  
- which groups are disproportionately targeted,  
- how many people were escalated without ever knowing,  
- how many lives were negatively transformed without recourse.

This node maps why this opacity is *structural*, not accidental.

## 🧩 Structural Analysis  

### **1. Prevent has no real reporting duty**  
The Home Office publishes:

- headline referral numbers,  
- crude ‘type of concern’ categories,  
- minimal demographic breakdowns.

But these figures exclude:

- digital flags,  
- metadata-based escalations,  
- internal Prevent hub screenings,  
- informal escalations inside schools or NHS trusts,  
- pre-referral triage,  
- abandoned referrals,  
- cases dismissed without paperwork,  
- internal notes that never entered the system formally.

The “Prevent statistics” are not statistics.  
They are the visible tip of a hidden architecture.

---

### **2. Channel has zero statutory transparency**  
Channel panels:

- do not publish membership,  
- do not publish minutes,  
- do not publish boundaries,  
- do not publish demographics,  
- do not publish outcomes beyond vague categories,  
- do not publicly report false positives,  
- do not notify participants if they are discussed.

This makes Channel functionally unmeasurable.

---

### **3. Police Prevent hubs are data-black sites**  
Prevent hubs within police forces:

- are not accountable to safeguarding boards,  
- are exempt from most FOI disclosure,  
- hold internal intelligence files,  
- can retain information indefinitely,  
- are not required to publish review mechanisms.

These hubs perform the majority of Prevent’s real work,  
but almost nothing is visible to the public.

---

### **4. Metadata escalations are invisible by design**  
Schools and universities increasingly use:

- keyword monitoring software,  
- internet filtering systems,  
- contextual safeguarding dashboards,  
- pattern-recognition alerts.

These generate Prevent referrals **without being counted as referrals**,  
because the escalation happens:

- digitally,  
- automatically,  
- silently,  
- outside human awareness.

This makes metadata-driven targeting **statistically untrackable**.

---

### **5. Racialised overrepresentation is expected but unquantifiable**  
We know from:

- academic studies,  
- select committee reports,  
- community testimony,  
- NGO monitoring,  
- limited Home Office data

that racialised communities are disproportionately targeted.

But the full extent is unknowable because:

- screening is secret,  
- metadata is invisible,  
- informal escalation is uncounted,  
- Channel triage is unpublished,  
- Prevent hubs are exempt.

The racial disparities we can see are only the **visible fraction** of the real pattern.

---

### **6. False positives are never recorded**  
Most people escalated through Prevent receive:

- no record,  
- no notification,  
- no rights,  
- no correction.

This means:

- there is no data on mistakes,  
- there is no data on harm,  
- there is no data on misclassification rates,  
- there is no data on cumulative trauma,  
- there is no data on systematic bias.

A system that hides its errors cannot be measured.

---

### **7. Prevent produces untraceable population-level effects**  
The harms Prevent generates include:

- chilled political participation,  
- self-censorship,  
- distrust of schools and NHS,  
- fear of disclosure,  
- withdrawal from civic life,  
- diasporic silencing,  
- suppression of community organising.

None of these show up in statistics.  
But they shape national political life.

Prevent’s “impact” cannot be measured through its own numbers,  
because the real impact is **behavioural, civic, and relational**.

---

## 🧪 Case Window (Structural Patterns)

*Identified across longitudinal research, legal reviews, FOI evidence, and public consultations — no personal data.*

- Muslim communities reporting Prevent anxiety even without direct referral.  
- Black parents avoiding schools due to fear of misinterpretation.  
- Jewish students flagged for searches about antisemitism after threats.  
- South Asian teens screened repeatedly without being told.  
- Autistic youth flagged for “intense interests” and never informed.  
- Universities monitoring activism without recording as Prevent action.

These patterns emerge precisely because **Prevent cannot be seen**.

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• When a system cannot be measured, it cannot be governed**  
Opacity is not a bug; it is the operational core.

### **• When a system cannot be appealed, its errors become permanent**  
People cannot correct what they cannot access.

### **• When targeting is invisible, racism becomes untraceable**  
Disparities are inevitable but unprovable.

### **• When the state observes citizens invisibly, consent collapses**  
There is no “policing by consent” when the policing is invisible.

### **• When governance hides itself, authoritarian drift accelerates**  
Democracies degrade not through spectacle,  
but through silent administrative creep.

*🏮 Why We Cannot Know Who Prevent Really Targets* is a systems-transparency node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It analyses how statutory opacity, metadata escalation, and multi-agency secrecy create a black hole in which targeting patterns, harms, and systemic bias become structurally unknowable.
