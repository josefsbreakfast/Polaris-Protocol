# ⚖️ Prison Contractor Questions
**First created:** 2025-12-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-17  
*Key governance questions raised when medical access in custody requires extraordinary external intervention.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node sets out **baseline accountability questions** that arise when a prison contractor or associated service appears to delay or obstruct urgent medical care, particularly where escalation only succeeds after political, professional, or reputational pressure.

The purpose is diagnostic, not accusatory.

---

## 🧿 Core Questions  

### 1. Authority and Decision-Making  
- Who had authority to approve or refuse ambulance access at the time risk was identified?  
- Was the decision clinical, operational, or managerial?  
- At what level did the refusal originate, and how was it recorded?

---

### 2. Clinical Escalation Protocols  
- What clinical thresholds trigger automatic external transfer?  
- Were those thresholds met, and if so, why were they not actioned immediately?  
- Were staff trained to prioritise medical judgment over security or procedural caution?

---

### 3. Contractor–Oversight Interface  
- When and how was the issue escalated to oversight bodies (HMPPS, MoJ, NHS commissioners)?  
- What instructions, if any, were issued back to the contractor?  
- Why did normal oversight channels fail to resolve the situation promptly?

---

### 4. External Intervention Anomaly  
- Why was ambulance access achieved only after:
  - MP involvement  
  - Police presence  
  - Off-duty clinicians negotiating  
- What does this say about the contractor’s internal escalation capacity?

Extraordinary intervention to secure routine care is itself evidence of systemic failure.

---

### 5. Risk Management vs Duty of Care  
- Were liability, reputational, or security concerns cited in decision-making?  
- How are staff instructed to balance perceived legal exposure against immediate medical risk?  
- Is there evidence that risk containment displaced harm prevention?

---

### 6. Documentation and Records  
- What contemporaneous records exist of:
  - Medical advice  
  - Refusal rationale  
  - Escalation attempts  
  - Time delays  
- Were decisions documented defensively or clinically?

Absence, delay, or ambiguity in records is itself material.

---

### 7. Pattern or Outlier  
- Have similar delays occurred previously at this facility or contractor?  
- Are hunger strikes, self-harm classifications, or “monitoring” used to defer transfer?  
- Is this behaviour consistent with known contractor failure modes?

---

### 8. Corrective Mechanisms  
- What immediate corrective action has been taken?  
- Have protocols been clarified or overridden to prevent recurrence?  
- Who is accountable for ensuring the next case does not require extraordinary pressure?

*Prison Contractor Questions* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a structured inquiry frame for assessing custodial healthcare failures without presuming intent.
