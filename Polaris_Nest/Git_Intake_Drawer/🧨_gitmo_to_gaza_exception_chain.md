# 🧨 Gitmo to Gaza Exception Chain  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How the West normalised torture, exported exceptionalism, and built the conditions for contemporary atrocity.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node maps the **continuum of legal exceptionalism** that links Guantánamo Bay to current torture and abuse of Palestinian detainees.  
It tracks how the West’s public consent to extra-legal detention created a **permission structure** later inherited by allied states.

---

## 🧩 Structural Outline  

### 1. Post-9/11 Legal Break  
- Suspension of habeas corpus  
- “Enhanced interrogation” as bureaucratic euphemism  
- US exceptionalism as global model

### 2. Normalisation Through Visibility  
- Torture done in the open  
- Statecraft shifting from secrecy → administrative cruelty  
- Media, JAG lawyers, and the ethics theatre

### 3. Exported Infrastructures  
- How allies adopt US logic  
- Israel’s military law, administrative detention, and wartime exception  
- Convergence of Western and Israeli security language

### 4. Gaza as the End of the Chain  
- Abuse of detainees  
- Desecration practices  
- Surveillance, humiliation, collective punishment

### 5. Collapse of Post-WWII Moral Narrative  
- From Nuremberg principles → Gitmo revisionism  
- How democratic identity was hollowed out
