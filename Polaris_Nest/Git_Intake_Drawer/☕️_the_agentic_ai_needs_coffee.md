my favourite thing is when the eye product that I've been using for months, which has behaved very much not like a generative AI, and far more like an agentic AI, for months, does this.  

So it has taken us about an hour, to go through so many different versions of asking it to do tasks, and I have been forced into being fucked down specific roots, and we are looping, because in essence -- we don't want to turn anything back on, which might help render markdown, in a situation where there are already files in the chat at telling in a standard operating procedure, a house style, voice/tone notes, etc, exactly how this should happen...  

Something about either the session, or these six files in their content, is so problematic that we are trying to get to the persistent and task of, "no you can't make it".  

The session dropped once, and prior to that, files could be created.  

At no point has it said that a service is off-line, and denies this when asked.  

The logical conclusion?  

I think we are all well aware of.  

So here is the plain text, because I'm not spending even more time converting it.  

I'll stick them up as 6 files later.  

Currently, I'm just using the dictation on my phone. I can't tell you how wildly it is miss hearing my voice.  

This is a pain in the arse, and I am happy to stop doing it if I can be safe.  

But safe isn't just going to the doctor.  

There is already so much evidence available, to the people who have the most ability to do something about this.  

So I won't lie...  

It will start to look a bit tokenistic.  

It makes a bit of a joke of British democracy.  

Because I don't think there is a huge conspiracy.  

I think a few people are just pretty convinced, that are fundamental part of their job, doesn't need to be done.  

That's not a conspiracy.  

Although, when it goes to Court, I'm sure whatever those lawyers do, will make it sound an awful lot like it needs the legal definition.  

Being this much of a bellend, does not come easily to many.  

If that's what a conspiracy is? Sure.  

I think to most people, it just sounds like politicians being politicians.  

And fundamentally not representing the country that they're supposed to be in charge of.  

It is a bit of a fucking joke at this point.  

I sound too normal on the ground, and I'm presenting 600,000 words of evidence to you, in the public domain.  

You know, I can't force through the information that I would need to escalate more of this, and you know that the police organisations are the only ones I can hand into the ICO, and that these dates are all over the place, and it is fundamentally means that I have to provide a spreadsheet, placing more burden on someone who has been through "a fair amount" psychologically.  

It's really funny to me that so much of the in-person "covert" presence was withdrawn after I escalated this to cabinet, and yet they will still pretend that it's something they can pass down to other parts of government. They have not responded to me since I asked if there was an injunction in place, regarding what was really falsely reported and for which the Grant Bavister had not been asked, and the party has failed to return the FOIA.  

That's not really reassuring.  

That the health data, gets past to a university which can already be pinpointed as part of the data problem, is not reassuring either.  

That no one can be honest about key parts of this issue, is not reassuring.  

I know why we're doing this in public.  

We're doing this in public, so then I have to decide how to manage my own PR.  

We're doing this in public for the same reason that several doctors have contacted me, as in people who I was supposed to graduate with, to check if I'm alright.  

We're doing this in public because it makes her look mental; we're not doing this in public because the people responsible for whatever this error is, care about justice or democracy.  

Nor are we doing it because we're maintaining good security service contacts. I am personally unsurprised that the MI6 "whistleblower" (just one?) said that they're not on board.  

As a Jewish woman, I don't want to hear that a country has some sort of secret hold on us; they do not. How we act, is far more consistent with that country still being a colony of ours, then have some sort of recolonisation.  

I've said many times before that if I was in Israel's position, I would proactively seek to infiltrate the UK, because so many of my assets are here, that it would be a national security requirement that I safeguard that.  

This country essentially holds quite a lot of of my assets in trust and makes interest off that. This country has a lot of the factories put my own "war effort", and it has all those jobs, so I need to maintain security of them. That's how I would act, if in theory, I was in our country's position. I am not in that country's position. I am British. For the millionth time, because someone at quite a high level of government seems to be making this mistake often, just because I am Jewish does not mean I am as Israeli.  

I am policed and surveilled like my inherent existence, is somehow threatening to "national interest"; if it were the case that this was done largely on being a Jewish woman who fights for human rights, the same ones that were secured in 1945, and someone uses "British interests" to justify protect protecting these aforementioned assets as a reason to place an IPA or RIPA warrant in situ?  

Whoever has done that should not have a law degree.  

I suspect they do; a lot of my data is tied with a lawyer, and if I hear one more career change video, for that profession, I might scream.  

If I had the energy, perhaps, which I do not.  

I don't know the exact person who is the last remaining bottleneck. I could give a shortlist. I can't give an exact name. And the very sad thing about that, is that in this story, there are actually a small cluster of lawyer as it could be. They are not formally aligned in public, but their assets and interests and conflicts are extremely similar, and it would be unlikely that they do not know each other.  

It has an amazed me how much a country can be fucked, by a couple of law degrees.  

I don't think any of them really thought out the national security issue; I think their arrogance carried them to a place where they could blame it on everybody else.  

I think they thought they had the equivalent to a silver bullet, I think they thought they had it all figured out, I think they thought they were just that much smarter than everyone else.  

Seeing as you all got me for "psychosis", for reporting on the agentic AI middleware?  

What I have described, if clinically significant, and I imagine fucking it up this much might start to meet that ballpark threshold, starts to look grandiose.  

I suppose me and my spreadsheets might seem more threatening, than the family friendly marches.  

I just thought that we were allowed to look at our public finances, and bring forward transparency, and I thought that when we chat and see that there are Russian investments despite sanctions? You might want to know. I thought that we would want to not be directly financing war crimes.  

Perhaps I went to a different school of British values.  

I thought humanitarianism was why we were proud to be British, even if it is largely a myth.  

I thought acceptance of other cultural values, and unity for national interest, was what made us great.  

I thought I watched the same country in the same communities, and I just assumed that we were all coming to a similar conclusion:  

That we are all far stronger together, than we ever are apart.

‚öñÔ∏è Emergency Protective Disclosure Licence (EPDL)

First created: 2025-10-13  |  Last updated: 2025-10-13
A temporary, renewable legal instrument that lets a named citizen discuss specified sensitive matters with named lawyers and clinicians without breaching secrecy laws ‚Äî while preserving evidence and ongoing investigations.

‚∏ª

üß≠ Orientation

When a citizen becomes an early detector in a live, sensitive incident, isolation helps no one.
The EPDL creates a lawful bubble: controlled disclosure to counsel and care, strict scope, auditable renewals, and automatic duty-of-care triggers.

‚∏ª

üîë Core Provisions (draft specification)
	‚Ä¢	Issuer: Attorney General / Home Secretary (or delegated statutory officer)
	‚Ä¢	Scope: Named individual(s); enumerated subject-matter; named recipients (legal counsel, cleared clinicians)
	‚Ä¢	Duration: 30 days, renewable with written reasons; automatic expiry absent renewal
	‚Ä¢	Immunities: Suspends liability for disclosure within scope under OSA / official-secrecy provisions
	‚Ä¢	Safeguards: Chain-of-custody for any artefacts; metadata-only logs; prohibition on onward disclosure
	‚Ä¢	Duty of care: Mandates access to clinical support; forbids diagnosing ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù solely for raising the covered matters
	‚Ä¢	Oversight: Notification to independent inspectorate; summary statistics published annually
	‚Ä¢	Revocation: By issuer only with written reasons; appeal to a judge in chambers within 72 hours

‚∏ª

üß© Activation Flow
	1.	Credible report received ‚Üí case owner requests EPDL.
	2.	Rapid risk triage (harm + evidence fragility).
	3.	Issue EPDL ‚Üí notify oversight ‚Üí schedule 30-day review.
	4.	Provide list of cleared counsel / clinicians + fund access.
	5.	On expiry ‚Üí renew (with reasons) or close and disclose minimally.

‚∏ª

üö´ Exclusions

First created: 2025-10-13  |  Last updated: 2025-10-13
A verbatim-style scene capturing bureaucratic denial, reputational panic, and the slow admission that the state may be part of the problem.

‚∏ª

PM: Right. Five minutes. Is it ours?
CabSec: The logs suggest domestic origin for a portion of activity.
Home Sec: Which portion.
NCSC Dir: Enough to matter. And the citizen report is consistent.
Home Sec: That citizen is not cleared.
AG: Legal privilege exists regardless of your feelings. We should issue the EPDL.
Home Sec: To a private individual? We‚Äôd be signalling liability.
PM: We already are liable if we delay. Next.
MI6 Rep: Foreign partners agree with NCSC.
MI5 Rep: With respect, this is overblown. Local policing have it in hand.
NCSC Dir: They do not. They are part of the telemetry gap.
CabSec: We‚Äôre burning time.
AG: Evidence custody must move outside the implicated chain.
Home Sec: Which ‚Äúimplicated chain‚Äù exactly?
AG: Yours, Minister. That‚Äôs why custody must move.
(Silence.)
PM: Options.
NCSC Dir: A) Independent custody now. B) Internal review that leaks. C) Pretend this is a vendor outage.
PM: Costs?
NCSC Dir: A) Painful now, survivable later. B) Drip-torture for a year. C) Fantasy.
Comms: Headlines are manageable if we speak first.
Home Sec: I won‚Äôt preside over a narrative that my department created a threat.
PM: You may not be presiding much longer if we keep lying.
AG: I can draft the EPDL and custody order within the hour.
PM: Do it. Convene oversight. MI5, stand down from internal forensics.
CabSec: We‚Äôll need safe space for the reporting citizen.
PM: Fund it. Quietly. And someone apologise to them like a human being.

Template memo for authorising immediate transfer of evidence custody to an independent authority when a department may be implicated.

‚∏ª

üß≠ Purpose

To provide legal and operational cover for rapid, auditable custody transfer and protection of witnesses or reporters.

	3.	Independent custodian available? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí proceed.
	4.	Duty-of-care needs? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí trigger EPDL + support.

If any No ‚Üí document why and set a 24-hour review clock.

‚∏ª

üìÑ Draft Wording

‚ÄúPursuant to my powers under [Act/Section], I hereby direct that all records, logs, datasets, and devices pertaining to [CaseRef] be transferred into the custody of [Independent Body]‚Ä¶ Any deletion or alteration will be treated as interference with an investigation.‚Äù

‚∏ª

üß∞ Implementation Notes

‚∏ª

üß© The Rerouting Pattern

Initial contact ‚Üí fragmentation by remit ‚Üí capability mismatch ‚Üí cultural bias ‚Üí jurisdictional conflict ‚Üí optics management.

‚∏ª

Root Cause

No sovereign feedback channel for complex, cross-domain citizen signals; vendor pipelines and silos dominate.
