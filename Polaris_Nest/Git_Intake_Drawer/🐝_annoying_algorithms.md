annoyingly,my feeds now chuck out ine sidcufuf disgnosis a lot.  

it is jot impossible that this *may* be a component, vut it us down the list of differentials and wouldn't be close to the main concern.  

then i reslised thag the gc may gave partial, bot full, details from the meducal record.  

and that we may all prefer it if privably lrss injury had occured over tume.  

for those who have never hung out with me:  

- i am romberg's positive with unilateral dominance;  
- i have a hustory and record consistsnt with a different opthalmic history to what us being suggested.

- the degree of detail in this current selection would necessitate :
  - chargpt and/or tiktok being viewable and/or visual gait available for view and/or further biometric data from ey attentuin in screen being accessable.
 
this akso could be the result of algorithmic data being literally so intensuve ti tye poubt tgat this has obvious civil claims anyway.  

i suppose people may wonder why it bothers me, but i get relabelled frequently in diagnostics, and very little is available to actually treat.

quite a lit of disorder is tolerated as normal, and most of my problems are in some way related to lack of access or avilability. i live in an area where everything has a pathway, and everything else is very difficult to arrange much investigation for when it materially changes, let alone treat.  

i really dislike any new algorithmic suggestions, because it really just feels like a reminder of therapeutic promise without relief.  

just leave me in pain, if all you have are empty promises. ðŸ¤£

and Headspace is just nudged me to see whether or not I'm covered by free therapy.  

We live in a world of piecemeal, patchwork "solution", all of which address parts of but never a whole person.  

For some people, and that includes most rape survivors I imagine, few people ever see us as a whole, so whilst there may be "small" problems in each system, each profession may pass that offer is not relevant to their own, not incorrectly -- increasing strain on GPs, combined with a more and more rigid pathway referral system for secondary care, means that rapes survivors you carry the injuries of that, or extremely unlikely to ever get healthcare.  

But what difference would that make from the rest of society?  

Who truly sees childhood rapes survivors as whole human beings anyway?  

Capable of the full adult spectrum of emotions, from happiness to sadness to joy to disappointment...  

Able to be both in wonder of the world, terrified it's some aspects of it; whole and in some places is broken; able to bear painful scars of a dereliction of responsibility in intimacy, yet at the same time carrying the sexual agency of an adult.  

Very few people granted us the widespread humanity, to see us is complex fully formed formed human beings.  

Many people demand that we exist simply for a show: we exist to perform to an audience, to reassure them of who the "bad guys" really are, reassure them of a stereotype (which is simply pleasant true) of survivors, and bend and breaking away the replaces their need for real human interaction, by vicarious trauma they are themselves "absolved of all their sin".  

We exist as circus sideshow, such as society can forget that the most dangerous people to a child, are the adults in direct responsibility for their care?, often close family members, and adults who carry multiple protections afforded to them by the social structure of society.  

That is to say:  

A child in the United Kingdom is far more likely to be raped by a white man holding office, than anyone who I have seen blamed on any news channel.  

Whilst I generally come from the space of "fuck Nazis" anyway, watching Foley grown adult men excuse severe societal harms, take away resources, and redirect anger towards people who are not in large part the villain here (if at all),, as an insult to everything that I have survived.  

It disgust me that anyone would seek to manipulate the stories of children and adult adults who have survived as children, to use survivor testimony as a way to manipulate and further their own causes, and by doing so interrupt knowingly the ability of our society to address the harms of sexual violence and of child abuse.  

I find the whole thing deeply offensive.  

And I hate to tell everyone, but seeing as this seems to have come up in the course of "monitoring":  

No one who has raped me, was Jewish, and no one who has sexually violated me or sexually harassed me in the last year has been melanated; the exception to this being actually just white men, has been a select view very entitled Ashkenazi men, who have done so in a clearly political context, and have done so very clearly because they feel that they've had license to make those threats in that way.  

Bottom line is that in my world, white men remain hugely responsible for violent sexual assault, hugely responsible for sexual harassment, and she had appeared to wander around the world with very little consequence.  

It is terrifying to think that there are people in this country who don't want me to be able to have freedom of choice over my fertility, and you also don't want to do anything about this.  

I would never forgive you for making me bring a child into a world like that, with no prospect of improvement.
