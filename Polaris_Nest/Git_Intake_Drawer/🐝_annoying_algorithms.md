annoyingly,my feeds now chuck out ine sidcufuf disgnosis a lot.  

it is jot impossible that this *may* be a component, vut it us down the list of differentials and wouldn't be close to the main concern.  

then i reslised thag the gc may gave partial, bot full, details from the meducal record.  

and that we may all prefer it if privably lrss injury had occured over tume.  

for those who have never hung out with me:  

- i am romberg's positive with unilateral dominance;  
- i have a hustory and record consistsnt with a different opthalmic history to what us being suggested.

- the degree of detail in this current selection would necessitate :
  - chargpt and/or tiktok being viewable and/or visual gait available for view and/or further biometric data from ey attentuin in screen being accessable.
 
this akso could be the result of algorithmic data being literally so intensuve ti tye poubt tgat this has obvious civil claims anyway.  

i suppose people may wonder why it bothers me, but i get relabelled frequently in diagnostics, and very little is available to actually treat.
