*How lawful career circulation shapes risk tolerance, precedent anxiety, and reluctance to draw red lines.*

---

## 🧭 What this node is
This node explains how routine movement between:

- senior MOD roles,
- military command,
- defence procurement,
- and arms-industry boards or consultancies

creates **structural incentives** that favour continuity over rupture.

It does **not** allege bribery or illegality.  
It maps **anticipatory alignment**.

---

## 🔁 What “revolving door” actually means
In the UK defence ecosystem it is common for:

- senior officers,
- senior civil servants,
- procurement specialists,

to move, post-service, into:
- arms manufacturers,
- defence consultancies,
- subcontractors,
- or advisory roles tied to export markets.

This is lawful and regulated (e.g., cooling-off periods).  
Its effects are upstream.

---

## 🧠 Anticipatory alignment (not quid pro quo)
Influence does not require a deal.

It emerges when:
- future career paths are visible,
- sectors are socially and professionally intertwined,
- and “disruptive decisions” are known to carry downstream costs.

The result:
- caution toward hard suspensions,
- preference for partial measures,
- emphasis on process over interruption,
- fear of precedent that could echo across theatres.

No instruction is needed.  
The system self-calibrates.

## ⚖️ Why this matters for prevention
Genocide prevention and IHL compliance require:

- early interruption,
- asymmetric caution,
- willingness to absorb short-term friction.

Revolving-door ecosystems bias toward:
- risk management,
- continuity narratives,
- and delayed action pending “complete information.”

This is **procedural conservatism** under moral stress.

---

## 🧩 Where the bias shows up
Typical expressions include:

- carving out “defensive” or “non-lethal” categories,
- relying on dual-use classifications,
- narrowing the scope of suspensions,
- sequencing reviews rather than pausing activity,
- emphasising supply-chain complexity as a barrier.

Each looks reasonable alone.  
Together they preserve capability.

---

## 🧯 Downstream effects
- Bright red lines become institutionally costly.
- Staff below ministerial level are left without refusal space.
- Legal exposure accumulates gradually.
- Public accountability is diffused.
- Prevention obligations erode into compliance theatre.

---

## 🧷 Working claim
The revolving door does not cause harm by intent.

It **conditions the system** to prefer:
- continuity over rupture,
- management over prevention,
- and defensibility over interruption.

In atrocity-risk contexts, that conditioning is dangerous.

*MOD–arms industry revolving door* is a political-economy node in the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to explain why lawful systems can still resist decisive action under severe humanitarian risk — and why this resistance does not require corruption to be effective.
