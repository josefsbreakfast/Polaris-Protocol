*Control, context, and agency in humour as a tool of survivor voice fidelity.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Humour operates as a social permission system. When someone from within a marginalised group tells a joke about their own identity, it functions as *agency*—a controlled discharge of tension that converts stereotype into ownership. When the same joke is told by an outsider, it functions as *power*: it re‑imposes the frame of objectification. The ethical boundary isn’t the words themselves; it’s **who controls the frame**.

## 🧠 Diagnostic Notes  

| Mode                | Who Holds the Frame | Social Function                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal irony      | In‑group speaker    | Reclamation → restores agency, validates lived experience.                      |
| External irony      | Out‑group observer  | Domination → reinforces stereotype, extracts humour as resource.                |
| Shared laughter     | Mutual context & consent | Solidarity → humour as relational bridge.                                        |

Humour from within trauma is a form of narrative sovereignty: you decide when to name the absurdity and when to make the room sit in silence.

## 🪞 Takeaway

*🃏 The Joke and the Right to Tell It* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**. It codifies the principle that humour becomes ethical when the person most affected by the joke controls its delivery.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
