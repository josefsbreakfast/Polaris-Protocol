# 🃏 The Joke and the Right to Tell It  
### Control, Context, and Agency

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Humour operates as a social permission system.  
When someone from within a marginalised group tells a joke about their own identity, it functions as *agency*—a controlled discharge of tension that converts stereotype into ownership.  
When the same joke is told by an outsider, it functions as *power*: it re-imposes the frame of objectification.

The ethical boundary isn’t the words themselves; it’s **who controls the frame**.

## 🧠 Diagnostic Notes  

| Mode | Who Holds the Frame | Social Function |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Internal irony** | In-group speaker | Reclamation → restores agency, validates lived experience. |
| **External irony** | Out-group observer | Domination → reinforces stereotype, extracts humour as resource. |
| **Shared laughter** | Mutual context and consent | Solidarity → humour as relational bridge. |

Humour from within trauma is a form of narrative sovereignty:  
you decide when to name the absurdity and when to make the room sit in silence.

## 🪞 Takeaway  
Ownership of humour is ownership of meaning.  
The difference between ridicule and resistance is authorship.
