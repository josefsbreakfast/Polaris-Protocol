# 🗒️ Field Note — Being Cross at Gung-Ho Nudge  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Captures subject’s emotional response to the discovery that evidence-based cautions on behavioural insights were noted but ignored in UK politics (2014–2016).*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
The subject expresses anger and frustration at the way British politics adopted nudging as a flagship solution while sidelining sensible cautions. The perception is of a cultural pattern: “gung-ho” optimism overriding systemic correction, producing shallow quick fixes.

---

## 📍 Observed Emotional Response  
- Anger that sensible witness evidence was ignored.  
- Frustration at the “gung-ho, this’ll fix it!” political instinct.  
- Rejection of the narrative: *“no babe, it really won’t.”*  
- Recognition that emotional response is part of authorship: the affective dimension of observing ignored evidence deserves to be recorded alongside factual nodes.

---

## 🔎 Why This Matters  
- Capturing emotional response documents the **human impact of systemic dismissal**.  
- Records how political style (optimism bias, short-termism) generates not only policy risks but also emotional alienation among citizens.  
- Maintains survivor authorship by including subjective voice in the archive, not just institutional facts.
