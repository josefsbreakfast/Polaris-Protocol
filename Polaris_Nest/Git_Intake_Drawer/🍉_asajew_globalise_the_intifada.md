# 🍉 As a Jew: “Globalise the Intifada”
**First created:** 2025-12-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-17  
*A Jewish, UK-based analysis of how political rhetoric misuses antisemitism frameworks, collapses Jewish plurality, and heightens risk for racialised groups.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node addresses contemporary claims by UK politicians that the phrase *“globalise the intifada”* is inherently antisemitic or threatening to Jewish people.  
It responds as a British Jewish perspective grounded in historical literacy, PSED analysis, and the IHRA’s own safeguards — particularly the prohibition on dual-loyalty assumptions.

---

## ✨ Key Claims (Summary)

- Jewish communities are **not monolithic**, and foreign state assessments do not represent Jewish sentiment in the UK.
- Treating Palestinian liberation language as inherently antisemitic is **historically inaccurate** and politically instrumental.
- Misapplication of IHRA and PSED **increases risk** for Muslims, Palestinians, and other racialised groups while flattening Jewish identity.
- Lockstep alignment with Israeli government messaging **reintroduces dual-loyalty logic**, the very harm antisemitism frameworks are meant to prevent.

## 🇵🇸 Historical Grounding: Intifada Is Not a Synonym for Antisemitism  

*Intifada* literally means *“shaking off.”*  
The **First Intifada (1987–1993)** was characterised primarily by:
- mass civil resistance,
- strikes, boycotts, and community organising,
- limited weaponisation on the Palestinian civil side.

Violence escalated through state repression.  
The later association of the term with armed violence derives largely from the **Second Intifada**, a specific historical phase — not an inherent definition.

To treat the term itself as violent or antisemitic is a **selective historical reading**, not a neutral one.

## ⚖️ PSED: Who Is Actually Being Considered?

Public Sector Equality Duty requires *due regard* to **all affected groups**, including:

- British Jews  
- Israeli Jews resident in the UK  
- British–Israeli Jews  
- British Palestinians  
- Palestinians resident in the UK  
- Palestinian citizens of Israel resident in the UK  
- People racialised as Palestinian (Muslim, Arab, South Asian)  

Any analysis that elevates *asserted Jewish fear* while ignoring:
- increased Islamophobia,
- racially aggravated sexual violence,
- physical risk to melanated bodies,

is **procedurally defective under PSED**.

Physical risk outweighs rhetorical discomfort. Current distributions of harm are not ambiguous.

---

## 🔥 Instrumentalised Trauma and the Survey Problem  

Jewish trauma — particularly linked to the Second Intifada — is real.  
What is unethical is its **instrumentalisation**:

- Biased surveys distributed immediately after traumatic events  
- Leading questions designed to manufacture affect  
- Data later cited to justify predetermined policy positions  

This is **behavioural nudging, not consultation**.  
It does not meet research ethics standards and should not be treated as evidence of communal consensus.

---

## 📜 IHRA Misuse and the Return of Dual-Loyalty Logic  

The IHRA working definition explicitly guards against:
> assuming Jews have dual loyalty or are more loyal to Israel than to their own nations.

When British politicians:
- echo Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs assessments,
- present them as proxies for “Jewish feeling” in Britain,
- or collapse Jewish safety into Israeli state legitimacy,

they **reintroduce the very logic IHRA is meant to prevent**.

British Jews are not an overseas constituency of a foreign state.

## 😒 Philosemitism, Antisemitism, and the Fear of Solidarity  

Both antisemitism and philosemitism rely on the same racist architecture:
- Jews as hyper-cohesive  
- Jews as disproportionately powerful  
- Jews as behind-the-scenes operators  

This is why Jewish solidarity with other racialised groups triggers elite panic.  
Solidarity disrupts divide-and-rule, challenges anticipatory obedience, and weakens authoritarian containment.

That fear — not Jewish safety — explains much of the current rhetoric.  

This rhetoric was part of escalation prior to the Shoah; the risk is not fictitious or ungrounded.  

---

## 🫀 Gendered Harm and Racial Reallocation  

Under pressure, racist tropes reshuffle rather than disappear:
- Jewish women framed as fragile victims or unreliable witnesses  
- Muslim and Black men hyper-sexualised as threats  
- Far-right antisemitism displaced onto Palestinian advocacy  

None of this protects Jews.  
It **heightens inter-community risk and resentment**.

---

## 🫒 Conclusion  

Rejecting the claim that *“globalise the intifada”* is inherently antisemitic is not denial of antisemitism.  
It is refusal to let Jewish identity be:
- flattened,
- instrumentalised,
- or conscripted into protecting state and capital interests.

Jewish safety is not secured by silencing Palestinians or racialised communities.  
It is secured by **plurality, solidarity, and historical honesty**.
