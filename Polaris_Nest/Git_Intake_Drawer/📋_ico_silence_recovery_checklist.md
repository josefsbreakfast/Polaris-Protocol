# 📋 ICO Silence Recovery Checklist  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*Procedural toolkit for re-engaging a stalled Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) case.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
ICO casework backlogs mean survivor and data-rights complaints can languish for months.  
This node provides a calm, rights-based recovery path to re-activate a dormant case without losing your evidential chain or statutory momentum.

---

## 🧮 Step-by-Step Recovery Process  

### 1️⃣ Re-queue Your Case  
Send a short follow-up to **casework@ico.org.uk** or reply to your original case-reference email:

> *Subject:* Case [reference number] — Status Enquiry  
>
> *Message:* “I’m writing to confirm the current status of my case reported on [date].  
> The issue concerns the potential mis-application of a national-security / OSA classification by [organisation].  
> Could you please confirm whether the case is still active and when I might expect an update?”  

🕐 Typical response time: 5–10 working days.

---

### 2️⃣ Escalate Internally at the ICO  
If you have **no update after 3 months**, request a **Casework Manager Review**:

> “Please treat this as a request for a Casework Manager Review under the ICO’s complaints-handling procedure.”

This routes your file to a senior reviewer.

---

### 3️⃣ Keep Pressure on the Data Controller  
While waiting, remind the council / trust DPO that ICO delay does **not** suspend their legal duty:

> “I note that my ICO case is still in progress; however, your statutory obligations under UK GDPR remain active.  Please provide your final response or rectification update within [set deadline].”

---

### 4️⃣ Escalate Across Regulators (if needed)  

| Sector | Alternate Regulator | Contact |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| Health (NHS England) | IG Team | england.ig-enquiries@nhs.net |  
| Justice (MoJ data) | MoJ DPO | data.compliance@justice.gov.uk |  
| Local Authority service failure | LGO | www.lgo.org.uk/complaint |  

Parallel investigations often re-stimulate ICO attention later.

---

### 5️⃣ Maintain a Running Log  

| Date | Action | Contact | Reply / Outcome |  
|------|---------|----------|----------------|  
| 2025-11-12 | Initial ICO submission | casework@ico.org.uk | Acknowledged |  
| … | Follow-up / Review request |  |  |  

Keep the log contemporaneous; the ICO and Ombudsman both rely on it when assessing delay.
