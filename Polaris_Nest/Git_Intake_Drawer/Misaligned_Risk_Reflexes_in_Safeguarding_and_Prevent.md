## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Safeguarding → Vulnerability Reflex  
Safeguarding frames risk as:
- unmet need  
- vulnerability  
- exploitation  
- instability  
- trauma  

Reflex: **intervene early + protect.**

---

### 2. Prevent → Influence Reflex  
Prevent frames risk as:
- ideological exposure  
- online grooming  
- exploitation by extremist actors  
- grievance + isolation  

Reflex: **monitor + contextualise + escalate only when patterned.**

---

### 3. Why These Reflexes Clash  
Safeguarding wants to escalate early.  
Prevent wants to escalate only when conditions converge.

Mismatch produces:
- over-referral  
- contradictory risk narratives  
- misinterpretation of distress as ideology  
- parallel paperwork loops

### 4. Harm Pathways  
- inappropriate Prevent referrals
