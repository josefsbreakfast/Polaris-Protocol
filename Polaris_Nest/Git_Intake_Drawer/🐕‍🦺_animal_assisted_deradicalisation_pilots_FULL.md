# 🐕‍🦺 Animal-Assisted Deradicalisation Pilots  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*Operant-conditioned companion animals as non-verbal stabilisers in early-stage deradicalisation, post-conflict reintegration, and VE-risk intervention.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents a quiet, rarely-acknowledged seam in violent-extremism rehabilitation: the use of **animal-assisted interventions (AAI)** — usually involving **operant-conditioned companion animals** — to enable stabilisation, co-regulation, and therapeutic access in individuals at risk of radicalisation or recovering from extremist involvement.

The practice is *not* typically framed as “counter-terrorism” in the UK or abroad; instead, it appears in:  
- trauma-driven deradicalisation work,  
- CAAFAG reintegration pilots,  
- youth violent-extremism early-intervention design,  
- and experimental psychiatric modalities where traditional cognitive derad models fail.

This node consolidates:  
1. terrorism-linked pilots using animals (e.g., **Jiyan Foundation / DeRaRe**),  
2. youth P/CVE evidence reviews recognising **AAT** as relevant,  
3. behavioural-science mechanisms (operant conditioning) underlying therapy-animal behaviour,  
4. the UK feasibility spine for how such an intervention *could* be authorised.

## ✨ Key Features  

- Animal-assisted therapy explicitly documented in derad pilots.  
- Youth VE evidence base endorses AAT as relevant.  
- Operant conditioning provides behavioural predictability.  
- Non-verbal stabilisation bypasses ideological defensiveness.  
- Clinical-governance + trauma-care footprint.  
- UK feasibility extremely narrow and clinical-only.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Where this appears in practice  
The **Jiyan Foundation / DeRaRe** programme for children formerly associated with ISIS is the clearest example. It explicitly lists:

> “animal-assisted treatment methods”  
> *for highly traumatised children linked to ISIS involvement.*

This is rare in extremism rehabilitation literature, which typically avoids sensory or non-verbal modalities.

Here, the logic runs:  
trauma stabilisation → reduced threat hyperarousal → restored relational safety → identity reconstruction → reduced radicalisation gravitational pull.

Animals serve as stabilisers, not ideological tools.

---

### 2. Youth VE-risk evidence  
The **NSW Government / UQ rapid evidence review** includes “animal-assisted therapy” among modalities relevant to youth rehabilitation in VE contexts.

This integrates AAT into VE work *through trauma science*, not security logic.

---

### 3. Operant conditioning as mechanism  

Therapy animals rely on:  
- positive reinforcement  
- behaviour chaining  
- stimulus control  
- predictability shaping  
- conditioned approach & leaning  
- co-regulation cues

Such animals can:  
- reduce dissociation  
- lower arousal  
- offer grounding pressure  
- serve as non-judgemental relational anchors

This bypasses cognitive defences and institutional distrust, which are chronic barriers in derad frameworks.

---

### 4. Systems & Governance → Experimentation  

This belongs in the “test-tube governance” layer:  
- ethically dense  
- clinically intensive  
- pilot-scale only  
- hybrid trauma-security interface  
- dependent on specialist sign-off  

It exemplifies how unconventional tools surface only at experimental edges of governance.

---

### 5. UK feasibility  

Only the following could authorise/run such a programme:

#### A. NHS tertiary trauma/forensic services (CAMHS Tier 4 / secure)  
- clinical psychologists  
- AAT-certified practitioners  
- safeguarding governance  
- HRA ethics if research-linked

#### B. Specialist trauma NGOs  
(e.g., Freedom From Torture, Anna Freud Centre)

#### C. Academic–clinical partnerships  
(security researchers + clinicians + AAT-trained handlers)

#### Absolutely excluded:  
- Prevent  
- Channel panels  
- CT Policing  
- MI5  
- Home Office delivery teams  

Because AAT is a **clinical** act requiring clinical authority.

*Animal-Assisted Deradicalisation Pilots* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how trauma-responsive animal-assisted methods intersect with deradicalisation and VE-risk intervention — exposing the limits of cognitive-only or security-first models.
