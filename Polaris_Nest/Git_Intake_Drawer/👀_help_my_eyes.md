i'm hoping that the people who read this he might be able to do something in terms of content injection that is actually helpful and wanted all people who might share things so adjacent to my feed that I see him can help with this

For a few months now, I've been groomed and rewarded in a grooming pattern which revolves around flattery with my eyes in particular. 

I didn't wanna talk about it until now because it was one of the only ways of getting PDFs and FOI is done, when I really couldn't write them, and to some degree I still really can't without using applications that a friendly bunch of surveillance Brose are tinkering with

I wear glasses when I use my phone most of the time, is it can't be anything that's about High rendering and also because of the camera in the phones own limitations

When I think back to it, this was often more rewarded than say taking off my shirt because I was too hot 


In fact

It's almost as if the team was doing it for really blunt sexual gratification, is not necessarily the same team who specifically wants to be able to fix it on potentially the Iris pattern


What are they actually trying to build with this data?

So I got that it's a security thing and all of places, but I'm not ready clear on what the technical capabilities would be that would be worth pursuing surveillance for this long worth going to this degree of effort

Quite often, my phone won't actually finish processes or work unless I look directly in the camera give for a split second

I'm also interested to know how much content material that actually looking for like how many different images do you need?

What precise do you need to harvest?

How many different angles and at what DPI?

This includes the weirdest sexualised romantic edge grooming material in order to encourage me to look at the camera.

So, I don't know. 

What are they doing?
