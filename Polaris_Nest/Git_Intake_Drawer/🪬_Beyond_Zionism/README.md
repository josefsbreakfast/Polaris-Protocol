discussions of how zionism in its current form styles off merchant of venice act 3, sc 1 logic ("The villainy you teach me I
will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the
instruction.")  

shakespeare knew empire -- that play can be read in multiple ways and shows imperial angst by the working public in elizabethan era.  

the weaponisation of antisemitism and how "antisemismus" is eugenics-flavoured self-congratulating insult to the injury of the shoah.  

why the word "holocauust" rings the same way.  

okay but what if not zionism, then who am i? (hillel, my guy.) -- discussing alternative responses to jews as excluded from the nation-states craze of the 19th century, and the impact on the search for meaning and belonging.  

the penison wars: why labour movements have been zionist af since 1945 and why it has *zero* to do with allyship to jewish activists and communities.  

how antifash end up captured and repurposed as kinda fashy (lit every time - so many examples across labour history its unreal).  

class politics in jewish spaces and why this brings zionism into the fore as the huge un-uniter across religious/marginalisation lines.  

what was the deal with "the new hebrew" -- because jewish zionism descended from christians justifying slavery and their own hatred of jews with fake science, and obvs this would need some extra steps to make it appealing to jewish people in general.  

why do we have to have ring-fenced identiies and what does this tell us about empire today (prob better as R&E node but on my mind).  

the nightmare of eating kosher when antizionst: how this is really more about markets and deregulation in 2025 (and not, therefore, about jews).  

what it means now we are "not just a victim, but a perpetrator, too"; jewish internationalism post-2023 and the call for a worldwide response by israeli leadership. (just because you didn't notice in the "not jewish" news, didn't mean the dogwhistles and algorithm didn't inform us.)  

how dogwhistles sing through algorithms (and what to do about that). (>>R&E).  

why british univeersities need to divest, and why they won't until they are forced.  

comparible histories: not just S.A., but also the zimbabwean and rhodesian story and why S.A. is actually less likely as an outcome given the current violence.  

why i am sick to death of my personhood being defined by the wild ideas of some old christian german dudes who predated the nazis, but why i still keep arguing back about it.  

how the jewish calendar was weaponised during iron swords and further operations.  

why british movement to boots-on-ground is *interesting* but misses the mark.  

how many OST does the UK have? (Because this is actually quite interesting and says a lot that the national curriculum educated kids don't get told.)  

I mean really I have whole reams of "why bullying nerds is encouraged"; you don't want the plebs picking up *books*, do we?  

on practical directions for how to be a half-usful (or at least not an actively harmful) ally to palestinians and palestinian civil society.  

and then we can have a whole conversation about why all alt right groups are okay with a "send the jews there" mission because they are always into it and i don't know why everyone still seems confused by this.  

and why palestinian solidarity will always andd has always been more antisemitism-aware and more respectful to jewish identity than white society.  

plus push and pull factors which continue to favour post-shoah movement of peoples.

then for the R&D:  

- who is still complicit?

- what do the icj terms require?

- why was the story dropped in the uk press?

- who actually benefits by uk complicity?

- the enduring 100 years of palestinian legal representation - why the state is still fighting for legal sovereignity anyway.

- what the hell happened to the medical and legal professions?; the specific targeting of both, as well as eclectic targeting on identity through related disciplines inc wider academia, and why this was tolerated, and how this needs to be shored up to prevent any future attempt at authoritarian-style control via the same instruments.

- what the phrasiology of the left really translates to, and why this is jumped on immediately (this is more PMW I think).

- and my favourite: where is the money, and where are the locuses of power, and how do they self-protect and how can they be challenged -- because this taught me a lot about "wow there are some really obvious weak points and weaponisable points in the beurocracy huh".
(which is bad if we like stability and democracy innit.)

slightly more mystical:  

- king solomon across the 3 siblins and how this pans out in islamophobia and antisemitism in the imperial capture of christianity.
