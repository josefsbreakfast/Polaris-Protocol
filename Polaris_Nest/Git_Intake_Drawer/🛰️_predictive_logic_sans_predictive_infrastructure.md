🪐 Predictive Logic Without Predictive Infrastructure

How institutions behave as if they are running predictive-policing systems even when no such technology exists.

⸻

Orientation
This note explains how UK public services, especially in education, health, and safeguarding, exhibit predictive-policing logic despite lacking the technical infrastructure for predictive modelling. The prediction-like behaviour comes from culture, incentives, training, and behavioural templates—not algorithms. The outcome is an environment that feels surveillant and anticipatory without possessing the machinery of true predictive policing.

Key Features
• Prediction emerges from mindset, not machinery.
• Staff act like human risk algorithms.
• Behavioural templates create pseudo-models.
• Institutional fear amplifies anticipatory interpretation.

What predictive logic means
Predictive logic refers to the belief that present behaviour signals future danger. It is the mental framework that underpins predictive policing, even when no automated model exists. PREVENT and related systems rely heavily on this logic. Staff are asked to anticipate risk and escalate before harm occurs.

Why institutions adopt predictive logic without the tech
Several factors make institutions think and act predictively:
• statutory duties requiring early detection
• broad, ambiguous “risk indicators” lists
• behavioural-science training materials
• policy emphasis on “spotting signs early”
• fear of missing something serious
• professional liability pressures
When staff internalise these pressures, they start interpreting behaviour through a “could this signal future harm?” filter.

Staff as human risk-scoring mechanisms
In the absence of formal predictive tools, staff become the de facto prediction engines. They interpret:
• disengagement
• anger
• distress
• ND-coded communication
• political interest
• isolation
as potential future threats. This mimics algorithmic risk-scoring, but relies on subjective impressions rather than data science.

Behavioural templates as pseudo-models
Training materials provided to frontline staff often include lists of “possible concerning behaviours.” These lists function like simplified feature sets in a predictive model. They encourage staff to look for patterns, align behaviours with templates, and escalate when a partial match appears—even if the context contradicts risk.

How predictive logic spreads across systems
Predictive logic moves easily between sectors:
• education adopts it through PREVENT and safeguarding training
• healthcare adopts it through risk-management frameworks
• social care adopts it through vulnerability assessment tools
• policing adopts it through professional risk heuristics
Over time, these sectors reinforce each other, creating a shared anticipatory culture.

Why people feel pre-judged or pre-interpreted
When predictive logic dominates, individuals experience:
• pre-emptive suspicion
• misinterpretation of emotional states
• fear of expressing distress
• pressure to appear calm and compliant
• increased scrutiny when behaviour deviates from norms
This feels like predictive policing because the interpretive framework is predictive—even without the infrastructure.

Impact on marginalised or distressed people
People whose behaviours are commonly misinterpreted (racialised groups, autistic adults, traumatised individuals, people in poverty) face disproportionate prediction. Without tech to regulate or standardise assessments, bias and subjective discomfort fill the gap.

The paradox of low-tech predictive policing
While advanced predictive systems can be audited, documented, and contested, predictive logic embedded in human judgement is harder to trace. It is diffuse, undocumented, and resistant to oversight.
