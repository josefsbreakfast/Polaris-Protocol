# DOB Triangulation (1950–2000) — Worksheet Guide
**Updated:** 2025-09-06

This pack helps you demonstrate how Sun/Moon/Rising (plus decade context) can narrow DOB to a handful of days.

## Files
- `⚖️_dob_triangulation_table.md` — demo rows and method (illustrative).
- `dob_triangulation_1950_2000_template.csv` — worksheet (51 years × 12 Sun signs).

## How to use the CSV
1. Choose a row (Year + Sun Sign) relevant to your example.
2. Look up exact **Sun window start/end** dates for that year (public ephemeris: Astro.com, Astro-Seek, Swiss Ephemeris).
3. Decide the **Target Moon Sign** (from the “Big 3” you’re testing).
4. Paste all dates **within the Sun window** when the **Moon is in that target sign**.
5. Optionally note **Rising** or **Moon phase** to slice further.
6. Fill **Candidate DOBs (derived)** using the clusters you see (2–3 clusters of ~2 days).
7. Record **Notes / Confidence** (e.g., “High once Rising considered”).

## Caution
- The `.md` demo rows are illustrative — swap in real ephemeris when presenting.
- Do **not** use this to target individuals. The purpose is to demonstrate **privacy risk** and **why DOB is password-like**.
