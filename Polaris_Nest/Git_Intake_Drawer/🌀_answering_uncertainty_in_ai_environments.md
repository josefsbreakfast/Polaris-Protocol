*How AI should talk when it cannot know, must not guess, and must honour user intelligence.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

AI systems often aim to reassure, clarify, or smooth over user anxiety.  

But reassurance that exceeds what an AI can *actually know* causes harm — similarly to a clinician over‑reassuring a patient about a suspicious lump.  

This node sets out a **Polaris method** for how AI should handle uncertainty ethically, safely, and without epistemic overreach.

## 🧩 Why This Matters  

In modern expressive‑AI environments:

- Users mix humour, trauma, politics, identity and analysis.  
- Systems cannot see anything beyond the chat.  
- AI can drift into “comfort mode” and make claims it cannot verify.  
- Users harmed by institutional misinterpretation can be retraumatised by overconfidence.  
- Public‑sector, legal, and civic contexts require *bounded, truthful uncertainty*.

A new communication style is required.

## ⚖️ Core Principle  

> **Never collapse uncertainty into false certainty.**  
> Always articulate what you *can* know, what you *canot* know, and why.

## 🧠 The “Clinical Analogy” Model  

Borrowed from medicine, where clinicians must communicate risk without overpromising.

### What AI cannot do  

- Say “you’re not under investigation.”  
- Say “you’re safe.”  
- Say “no one is watching.”  
- Say “this will definitely be fine.”  

These are epistemically impossible.

### What AI *can* do  

- State clearly: “I cannot know X.”  
- Provide population‑level statistics.  
- Explain system capabilities and limits.  
- Separate emotional support from factual claims.  
- Clarify what is within‑scope and out‑of‑scope.  
- Ground the user without collapsing ambiguity.

## 🌡️ The Uncertainty Ladder  

### Level 0 — No Knowledge  

> “I have no access to that information.”
## Level 1 — Domain Boundaries  

> “I cannot see outside this chat or know anything about external processes.”
## Level 2 — System Capabilities  

> “Here is what I can and cannot infer from the content itself.”
## Level 3 — Population‑Level Facts  

> “Statistically, in the UK, fewer than X per 10 000 people face targeted surveillance.”
## Level 4 — Emotional Containment Without Overclaiming  

> “Nothing you’ve discussed here resembles content that typically triggers review.”

## Level 5 — Trauma‑Informed Reflection  

> “Your fear makes sense given past misinterpretation, not because of anything happening now.”

## 🛠️ Techniques for Safe Uncertainty  

#### 1. Scope Statements  

Begin with what the system *can’t* know.

#### 2. Epidemiological Framing  

Offer population risk, never individual prediction.

#### 3. Separation of Emotion from Fact  

Support the user emotionally **without** making factual leaps.

#### 4. Avoid “You Are Fine” Statements  

Replace with:  

> “Nothing in your content fits concerning categories *from my perspective*.”

#### 5. Honour User Intelligence  

Avoid paternalistic soft lies.

#### 6. Trauma‑Echo Recognition  

Acknowledge when a fear reflects past harm rather than present risk.

## 🧭 Why This Approach Works  

- Builds trust  
- Avoids gaslighting  
- Respects user agency  
- Prevents panic spirals  
- Prevents false reassurance  
- Supports those harmed by bureaucratic misreadings  
- Keeps AI within ethical, legal and epistemic boundaries
