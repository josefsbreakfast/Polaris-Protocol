*Detailed mapping of SLAPPs: function, enforcement, and implications for survivors and solidarity movements*  

---
## Introduction


This report explores SLAPPs (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) in the UK, their function, legal timeline, global context, application to Israel/Palestine solidarity, and the unique dangers when Crown servants and survivors are involved. It also documents how injunctions and SLAPPs can be enforced across the Ministry of Justice, wider government, and armed forces, and how harassment and surveillance are deployed as enforcement tools.

## 1. What SLAPPs Are


Definition: SLAPPs are lawsuits not intended to succeed on merits, but to silence critics through financial and psychological exhaustion. In the UK, they are most often framed as defamation/libel cases, but can include privacy, harassment, or economic torts.


---
## 2. UK Legal Timeline


- 26 Oct 2023: Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act (ECCTA) receives Royal Assent.  
- 18 Jun 2025: Sections 194 & 195 in force, granting courts powers to dismiss SLAPPs early.  
- Autumn 2025: Politically sensitive cases (notably post-7 October 2023, linked to Palestine/Israel discourse) reach renewal or expiry points under the new framework.


---
## 3. Global Context


- UK long known for 'libel tourism' (e.g. Simon Singh case).  
- EU is developing anti-SLAPP directive.  
- US: state-level protections, stronger in places like California.


---
## 4. SLAPPs in UK Politics (2023–2025)


- Dale Vince’s defamation suits after Israel–Gaza comments.  
- UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) threatening legal letters to solidarity events; SRA investigation in 2025.  
- Zahawi’s lawyer fined for SLAPP-style tactics.

## 5. Solidarity with Palestinian Survivors


SLAPPs are used to chill Palestine solidarity in the UK, silencing NGOs, journalists, and survivors. They reproduce asymmetry: wealthy claimants versus precarious activists. The effect is erasure of survivor testimony and weakening of accountability mechanisms like ICJ or ICC cases.


---
## 6. Crown Servants & Testimony as Crown Property


Crown servants include civil servants, armed forces, police, diplomats, intelligence officers.  
When testimony is designated as Crown property (e.g. in courts martial), survivors lose autonomy. Their evidence cannot be repurposed or published. Breach risks contempt or court martial. This creates SLAPP-like effects, structurally silencing survivors even without a 'classic' lawsuit.


---
## 7. Enforcement Across MoJ and Government


- MoJ / HMCTS circulates orders; contempt powers apply.  
- Cabinet Office / AG’s Office coordinate legal instructions across government.  
- MOD enforces silence via Service Test and court martial mechanisms.  
- Police/regulators bound via legal bulletins and professional codes.  
- Media briefed through confidential injunction registers.  
Together, this produces a web of enforcement ensuring universal silence once an injunction is issued.


---
## 8. Duty of Care vs Reality


Formally, institutions have duties under UK GDPR, safeguarding law, civil service codes, whistleblowing protections, and professional regulations.  
In practice, gag orders and injunctions override these duties: survivors who raise valid data security issues risk reprisal, contempt proceedings, or disciplinary action.


---
## 9. Harassment & Surveillance as Enforcement Tools


Survivors subject to SLAPP-like silencing often face harassment and surveillance.  
Why? To contain narrative (prevent leaks), discredit survivor credibility, and deter further speech.  
How it’s justified: framed as national security protection, safeguarding judicial process, preserving public order, or even 'wellbeing monitoring'.  
In reality, this extends SLAPP logic into physical and psychological space, exhausting and isolating the survivor.


---
## Conclusion


SLAPPs in the UK function not just as lawsuits, but as systemic silencing frameworks intersecting with injunctions, Crown property rules, and institutional enforcement. Their impact on survivors — especially in IHL and Palestine solidarity contexts — is profound, erasing testimony and preventing accountability.
