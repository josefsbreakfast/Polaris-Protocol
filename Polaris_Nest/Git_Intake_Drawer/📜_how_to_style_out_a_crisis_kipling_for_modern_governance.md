## 🛰️ Orientation  
Kipling’s *If—* is less a poem than a prototype crisis-management manual. Every stanza reads like a service-college exercise in how to survive the collapse of your own plan without alarming the shareholders.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Keep Your Head:** somatic regulation for bureaucrats.
- **Trust Yourself When All Men Doubt You:** narrative control under inquiry conditions.
- **Wait and Not Be Tired by Waiting:** time-based strategy as reputational triage.
- **Dream — But Don’t Make Dreams Your Master:** hope management in ministerial settings.
- **Walk with Kings Nor Lose the Common Touch:** performative empathy for hierarchical ecosystems.
