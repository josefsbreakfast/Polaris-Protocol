# 🧠 Shame Economics
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-11
*Mapping shame as symbolic currency in moral and governance economies.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
This node explores how shame operates not as emotion but as **exchange rate**—a mechanism through which institutions maintain power, legitimacy, and social order.  
Survivors are often positioned as “debtor class”: their reputations collateralised against institutional credibility.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Shame as moral tax** — credibility extracted to subsidise authority.  
- **Containment through embarrassment** — coercive silence disguised as civility.  
- **Reinvestment loops** — how systems recycle survivor affect into institutional virtue-signalling.

---

## 🧿 Analysis / Content
Shame behaves like soft currency: invisible, convertible, and deflationary over time.  
It circulates between media, governance, and social capital markets, laundering violence into etiquette.  
In survivor testimony, shame is both imposed and strategically refused — the refusal itself becomes a counter-economic act.
