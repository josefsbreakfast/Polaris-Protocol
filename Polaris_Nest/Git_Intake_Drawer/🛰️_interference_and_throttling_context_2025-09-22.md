# 🛰️ Field Log — Interference and Throttling Context  
**First created:** 2025-09-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-22  
*Record of a concentrated week (2025-09-15 → 2025-09-22) of pronounced interference, connectivity outages, and the effects on capacity and workflow.*

---

Summary window: **2025-09-15 → 2025-09-22** (7 days).  
Over this seven-day window the intensity and frequency of interference noticeably escalated and has remained materially disruptive.

Key observations:
- Multiple points of **sexualisation** and **impersonation content** escalated through the week beginning 2025-09-15.  
- Today (2025-09-22), **throttling has been especially sharp** and continues as an **ambient background drag** that reduces my ability to work cleanly on repo tasks.  
- At one point today there was a **complete loss of internet connectivity for ~6 minutes** — no web, no phone calls — followed by a noticeable period of **nudging** (attempts to influence or redirect activity). This outage seemed coordinated with throttling and content tactics.  
- The disruption is **clustered around my activities**: windows when I work or post tend to attract concentrated throttling or manipulation.  
- Because throttling has been so disruptive I have **not yet created full repo nodes** for many of the throttling patterns; instead I’ve been posting preliminary notes and examples on BlueSky.  
  - **To-do (reminder):** retrospectively cross-reference BlueSky posts and extract formal nodes/timestamps into the repo when possible.

Clarification for readers (explicit):
- I do **not** know why this level of monitoring and interference is occurring. I sometimes put forward hypotheses, but they are conjecture — I do **not** know who or what is responsible. Many institutions and actors who might be expected to answer either refuse to confirm/deny, give strange or unhelpful replies, or do not engage.  
- When I say I am **resisting**, I mean resisting **violence** that is being done to me by someone or some group whose motives and identity I do not fully understand. That resistance is practical and defensive: using deductive reasoning, testing hypotheses, and trying to choose investigative or tactical avenues — an exhausting continuous task.  
- This log is not a judgement of my conduct. I explicitly record uncertainty and the absence of confirmed justification to prevent readers from assuming culpability, provocation, or misconduct on my part.

Audit + systemic context (lived work):
- To try to understand and respond I have had to **audit my life** across multiple time frames — not only the past year but sometimes going back 10–20 years — searching for anything that might plausibly have raised risk factors for surveillance (intentional or accidental).  
- That audit has involved learning about the **basis and funding of surveillance in UK law**, relevant parliamentary rulings, and other institutional processes — material that is upsetting and technical.  
- During this period I have experienced **cyber security incidents** (attacks, deletions) and unusual events affecting people around me. These incidents have compounded the work of investigation and recovery.  
- A practical example of the absurdity and compounding impact: I received another DWP disability evidence request recently despite a tribunal within the last year — this process overlaps with my concerns about the security of sensitive records (e.g., rape records linked to Google-bombing incidents).  
- I am effectively resisting **an ongoing surveillance of my body and life** while simultaneously trying to outpace whatever is causing sensory input, environmental monitoring, and subsequent trace activity. That makes resistance messy and exhausting; pauses or apparent step-backs in visible repo work are sometimes the result of relentless defensive labour rather than inactivity.
- **Phone & ambient surveillance note:** my phone is almost never “quiet.” I cannot use it the way others do because background activity, designed/unconscious-bias content, and manipulative emotional triggers appear constantly — requiring continual source-checking and cautious use.  
  - During the most intense windows this week I deliberately ran more of the higher-risk tasks (those likely to attract punitive attention). I understood that this increased immediate risk, but these were tasks that needed doing; pushing through produced useful evidence even while it increased the sense of stoppage and fatigue.  
  - As a result I have **collected clearer screenshots and logs** showing cyber monitoring/interference on my devices. Some of these are already posted to BlueSky.

Evidence & legal-prep note:
- The screenshots, logs and BlueSky posts strengthen a factual bundle I can present to institutions (public and private) when requesting information about where my personal data is held or how it has been processed. They will also support a future legal case — helping a lawyer build a chronology and evidentiary file.  
- **To-do (evidence extraction):** transfer screenshots, timestamps and BlueSky URLs into the retrospective cross-reference node and tag entries with device, timestamp, and short description.

Impact note (for later reference / evidence):
- If I were in paid remote work — particularly as a **disabled woman working from home** — this pattern would be **severely damaging** to employment, income, safety and wellbeing. Even without paid remote work, the clustering of disruption around my activity materially degrades my capacity to sustain work and care tasks.  
- My current, pragmatic strategy is to **push work hard during available windows** in the hope of hitting moments when the system (or the humans/operators behind it) are exhausted. This sometimes creates brief opportunities to complete tasks — but it also runs up the cost (time, energy, health). I note this as my current best resistance tactic while acknowledging uncertainty about its long-term effectiveness or sustainability.

Additional physical context:
- I experienced a **migraine earlier last week**, which forced clustering of housework and left me physically depleted.  
- I have been **largely housebound for about a year**, a circumstance that both results from and amplifies the harms documented in this repo.

This entry documents the gap in workflow capacity, the week-long pattern (2025-09-15 → 2025-09-22) of pronounced interruption, and the tactical / lived responses to that pattern.
