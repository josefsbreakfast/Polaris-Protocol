# 📎 Pathway Fit Error — When Systems Mistake Unique Regulation Profiles for Established Diagnoses  
**First created:** 2025-10-25  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-25  
*How service design flattens complex trauma presentations into pre-existing categories.*

---

## 🌱 Orientation  
Many health-care systems are **pathway-dependent**: clinical assessments are guided by the referral routes, billing codes, and service templates already in place.  
When a person’s presentation doesn’t map neatly onto those boxes, the system creates a *translation*—not to clarify, but to process.

---

## 🧭 1 — Mechanism of Compression  
- **Administrative gravity:** clinicians must attach a recognised code to unlock care.  
- **Template bias:** forms and screening tools privilege binary traits (high / low affect, social / asocial).  
- **Result:** nuanced regulation styles—especially trauma-adapted or conceptual ones—are flattened into the nearest billable construct.  
  - “Too analytical” → ASD pathway.  
  - “Too emotional” → EUPD pathway.  
  - “Variable” → Somatisation or Functional Disorder.

---

## 💡 2 — Impact on Care  
- Mis-specification leads to **inappropriate therapy models** (e.g., CBT vs DBT) and **lost trust** between clinician and client.  
- Physical health is also reframed through the same lens (“psychogenic,” “stress-related”).  
- The individual internalises contradiction—told simultaneously they are *too detached* and *too reactive*.

## 🧩 3 — Sample Language for Reports / Letters  

> “My presentation reflects complex trauma with a concept-first regulation style.  
>  Emotional expression varies by state and context rather than indicating instability.  
>  Existing diagnostic pathways in this locality may not fully represent this profile; please interpret assessment findings with awareness of pathway dependency and trauma-informed frameworks.”

## 🧠 4 — Clinical References and Frameworks That Fit  
| Domain | Approach | Why It Helps |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Trauma & Somatic | **Sensorimotor Psychotherapy**, **Somatic Experiencing** | Works with autonomic regulation without collapsing cognition. |
| Parts-based | **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** | Normalises oscillation between observer and feeling states. |
| Cognitive-affective integration | **ACT / DBT hybrids** | Balances acceptance with skill training. |
| Neurodiversity-affirming | **Polyvagal and Interoceptive Awareness approaches** | Read regulation, not just behaviour. |

---

## 🧱 5 — System Reform Notes  
- Encourage local services to record *“presentation not otherwise specified — trauma-informed review pending.”*  
- Use MDT meetings to advocate for **functional formulations** rather than categorical labels.  
- In care coordination, request a **named clinician for continuity** to avoid repeated re-coding.

## ✨ 6 — Reflection  
When pathways demand conformity, difference looks like disorder.  
The goal is not to invent new boxes, but to preserve fidelity to lived complexity—so the record tells the truth without distorting the person.
