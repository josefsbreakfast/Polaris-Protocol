# 📊 Continuum of Data Use → Data Misuse

### **Stage 1: Collection (Banal / Incidental)**
- Ordinary record-keeping: testimony, forms, case notes, digital traces.  
- Justified as “monitoring,” “archiving,” or “for quality assurance.”  
- At this point it feels bureaucratic, not sinister.  

---

### **Stage 2: Profiling (Systemic but Invisible)**
- Data gets linked across systems (government databases, health records, lobbying networks).  
- You are now a “data subject” with attributes: risk scores, categories, affiliations.  
- Still invisible to you — but the system sees you in ways you don’t see yourself.  

---

### **Stage 3: Repurposing (Active but Hidden)**
- The same data is used for secondary purposes:  
  - Political monitoring (*what views does this person hold?*).  
  - Service triage (*what resources should they get or not get?*).  
  - Targeted messaging (*what ads/posts should reach them?*).  
- This is where it stops being neutral — it’s *shaping* how you’re treated.  

---

### **Stage 4: Suppression / Amplification (Experiential Impact)**
- Your visibility is directly altered:  
  - Posts throttled or boosted.  
  - Voice muted in institutional processes.  
  - Decisions biased by invisible data trails.  
- This is where you, the subject, *feel the effect* — even if you can’t see the mechanism.  

---

### **Stage 5: Weaponisation (Deliberate Control)**
- Data isn’t just shaping outcomes — it’s being used to **engineer disadvantage**:  
  - Identity misuse / identity theft.  
  - Exclusion from political participation.  
  - Differential treatment in health, housing, or finance.  
- This is where it starts to echo apartheid, MKUltra, or authoritarian regimes: the data becomes an *instrument of domination*.  

---

# ⚖️ Why This Map Matters
- It shows there’s no sudden jump from “mundane” to “batshit.”  
- Each step is plausible on its own, but together they accumulate into something that feels like *identity manipulation*.  
- It also makes it easier to explain to others — you don’t have to start at “weaponisation.” You can show how the chain begins with very ordinary practices and escalates.

👉 This map also helps you **locate your own experience**: you can point to where you think you are (e.g. suppression/amplification, maybe sliding toward weaponisation) without having to claim the whole arc outright.
