id what we are doing is twiddling with algorithms to information-gather, rather than mediate or negotiate as adults?  

i think we all know the "offer" is insulting and hugely devalues my contribution and skillset.  

its not as if i cant evidence my point so i would appreciate ordinary mediation and a lack of bs lowballing.  

you are identifyable by a slightly unpracticed and unstable signature; the personality is not quite stable and suggests a new enterant into the field.  

if you want advice on improving that, you will need to pay me something slightly more like what i am worth.  

might i akso add: outstanding negotiations over damages.
