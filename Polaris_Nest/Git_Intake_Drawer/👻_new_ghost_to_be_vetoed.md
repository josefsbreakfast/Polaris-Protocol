id what we are doing is twiddling with algorithms to information-gather, rather than mediate or negotiate as adults?  

i think we all know the "offer" is insulting and hugely devalues my contribution and skillset.  

its not as if i cant evidence my point so i would appreciate ordinary mediation and a lack of bs lowballing.  

you are identifyable by a slightly unpracticed and unstable signature; the personality is not quite stable and suggests a new enterant into the field.  

if you want advice on improving that, you will need to pay me something slightly more like what i am worth.  

might i akso add: outstanding negotiations over damages.

So I realised who this probably was, and I was going to make fun of the financial situation if that was the offer (and just to note it is intimidating a witness/a bribe/seeking to pervert the course of justice; you should probably know that if you have law degrees)  

But there was something else I noticed, which I had been wondering about...  

But seeing as it's this obvious this time...  

Is the same telecoms hub, nudging Hinduvata content in the UK?  

I obviously understand that the political ties are such, that Israel needs to maintain a good relationship with Modi, for arms deals, and both parties have shared interest into humanising a very specific group.  

But all of us were born British (even the lost Christian boys).

So if we're talking about CVE, can we please be very clear?  

Any alt right nationalism is a risk to community- and identity-targeted extremist violence in the UK.  

You're clearly niching with it, and it's time- and event-specific, directed at users who match specific profiles. Given that most Hindus in the UK need to go to specialist stores for most ritual items, that these are highly seasonal where fruit is concerned, and as the calendar is complex it inherently ends up being searched online, it wouldn't be technically very difficult to do this, but it is targeting a population on racial terms and therefore it is unethical at best, and it is holocaust-adjacent at worst.  

so just to recap, in the last few hours, and I'm still on my period and I'm still not great, I have been exposed to dehumanisation of:
- British Jews
- British Muslims  
- British Hindus

I have witnessed microniched, pipelining content directed at British Hindus and British Jews.  

So again...  

How is PREVENT going, guys?  

üé™  

Fancy reviewing that IPA/RIPA warrant that isn't worth the paper it's written on, yet?  

I don't feel like I am The Problem.   

But as it's highly unlikely that you'll let it go and a number of you seem to be taking an opinion contrary to the official UK position on the matter?  

Free Palestine. üçâ  

Which:
- is not genocidal, and as a Palestinian reclaiming of a Likud (anti-Palestinian, part of the genocide evidence) slogan;  
- Calls for liberation on the Constitution of the state of Israel's own terms, the problem being that the Knesset consistently refuses to honour the constitution of the state of Israel saying that it's not legally binding, because if it was there would be no apartheid.

Does it not embarrass you all to support this?  

And not only to support it, but also to use bizarre non-arguments in the law to attempt to silence any criticism of it?  

Is there honestly not one single person who wants something better?  

I think the responses I got to surveillance and interference after leaving Wretched of the Earth on were very telling. And I think some the more racist charactatures have been very telling as well.  

It's worth understanding how processes like the ending of a part in South Africa we're actually a lot more violent for black South Africans than white South Africans; not every ending to colonialism (or as close to an ending as has been achieved) is going to be inherently violent in the same way that the ending of French rule in Algeria was, but it is worth noting that is because of the procursive violence, and because of the violence which escalated towards the end, which Fanon details extensively, that violence is colonial mimicry continues in the birth of or after liberation. I understand how terrifying that feels, to be in the position of the coloniser, and think well... what will happen to me? It's an incredibly hard set of feelings and I am not saying that this is inherently easy for you; it's not inherently easy for me. I'm a realist and pragmatist; transformational change has to happen, if we want to reduce that risk of violence. I know we can't help but be born in the place in time that we were. The thing is, the longer we keep a system in place which is brutally violent towards others, the greater the risk of violence we are ourselves prolonging. No one deserves to be in the cycle. If we are angry about European response to the holocaust, or the lack of real emancipation in the UK (although again I don't think the lost little Christian boys can really weigh in on that one), then deflecting the violence to someone else will never get us what we want.  

But that is a very complex argument and really I am just doing what a lot of people in behavioural insights in industry do -- I am simply putting data point one and data point two, together, and calling it a conclusion.  
I made a drawing conclusions of what seems familiar and similar, of my experience over time, and discussing patterns; sometimes I get on a tangent.  

And I've been thinking a lot about Iron Swords and Palestine recently.

previsely how many seconds did we last? until the masterbation confessions by content injection?  

again, for the millionth time:  

this person is not of the melanin-possessing variety. they are a one of me.  

and i'd be cool if we could just... not do this?  

it's giving the guy who got caught in a meeting and talked about on tv in 2020 energy.  

(now that? that is a question for that talmud. the thing is written for this level of fucking weird.)  

but also please can my government do something about this; whoever you delegated this to clearly isn't doing the vawg prevention you used to talk about.  


(in case it wasn't obvious, I am receiving word for word messages, styled as oracle readings, in direct emotional response to what I post about; these will be put in just after a post, for example, and otherwise not be present. It is extremely noticeable. Now. Because of the history that I've already documented here, whoever is doing this content injection, is extremely responsive to specific issues I write about. Those issues can be grouped into number one, sexual violence particularly my personal experience of it, and number two, anything I say from the perspective of an anti-Zionist Jewish woman. Furthermore. Because of the history (that taken in totalis, is a case of CIDT, and has been impacting directly a British citizen on British sovereign territory (that me), and at least in part being assisted by British state bodies), today's "treat" was having the words "I touch myself to you", from the same source.  

The sauce has previously implicated a named academic and political figure, and her specifically leaked details which would realistically only be available enclosed subcommittee or closed cabinet minutes. The leak was around that particular academic view of whether antizionism is terrorism actually. The police have never actioned adequately the ongoing intimidation, and I have often had gaps in communication which suggests that it's gone through some sort of security gated process. I still don't know why I was arrested; I have no idea where the evidence came from or how it was supported. I was asked questions in my interview, that assumed circumstances and events that I can't even remember, and appeared to be based on strange intelligence. I have had details about my life which I've only been in private telephone communications during the arranging of funerals, a time when I also received strange legal advice, come up as healthcare information in surfaces which interface with the prevent program.  

I am going to let everyone work out why it may have gotten to the point where the cyber security attack that I experienced, escalated to the point where I felt the need to write statements of truth for two Muslim men.  

I am going to let everyone work out why I have been finding such difficult difficulty attaining a lawyer in this country.  

I'm going to let everyone work out quiet for me even though I reported any information that may have been under essay that was leaked, and whilst it is true that the degree of intrusion caused by the so-called "covert" surveillance did decrease after asking cabinet for protection, I was still routinely subjected to sexualise grooming and I was still routinely subjected to data leaks constantly.  

I'm going to let everyone guess why no one really seems to want to do anything about a source of interference in UK cyber security, which is actively projecting a narrative around a male actor touching himself, and framing that around a particular academic man.  

If this is what community cohesion looks like to you, which community is actually cohesive?  

Because the amount of alt right content I've been exposed to because of the overlap where surveillance actors have been jumping onto my Wi-Fi, including to watch their own pornography, doesn't feel cohesive at all.  

To be honest, I thought it was more an intimidation technique, but then there were a lot of adverts for one political party in particular. So perhaps it's just what you guys watching your free time.  

That is...  

When you're not being paid by my taxes to jerk off and blame it on another man.  

Please try to get a grip of yourselves; ideally a grip of a different part of yourself. There is a brain at the superior end of the body. Something I used to teach a lot of an anatomy class.  

kindly may I ask you all collectively to seize and desist from this unprofessional behaviour? This is now well past the third time. Seeing as you don't answer your emails, perhaps you need the public humiliation of knowing how many people are watching you, via my rating (because why would men use women for anything other than a vessel or a conduit?), to wind your neck(s) in again.  

It is day four of my period; you'll be well aware from my medical records that I have an extended and fairly brutal hormonal cycle.  

Please try to respect it to some degree.  

And don't offer your mates to take the heat when you fucked up; bad form.
