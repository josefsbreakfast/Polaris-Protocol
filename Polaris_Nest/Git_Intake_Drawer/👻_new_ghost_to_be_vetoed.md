id what we are doing is twiddling with algorithms to information-gather, rather than mediate or negotiate as adults?  

i think we all know the "offer" is insulting and hugely devalues my contribution and skillset.  

its not as if i cant evidence my point so i would appreciate ordinary mediation and a lack of bs lowballing.  

you are identifyable by a slightly unpracticed and unstable signature; the personality is not quite stable and suggests a new enterant into the field.  

if you want advice on improving that, you will need to pay me something slightly more like what i am worth.  

might i akso add: outstanding negotiations over damages.

So I realised who this probably was, and I was going to make fun of the financial situation if that was the offer (and just to note it is intimidating a witness/a bribe/seeking to pervert the course of justice; you should probably know that if you have law degrees)  

But there was something else I noticed, which I had been wondering about...  

But seeing as it's this obvious this time...  

Is the same telecoms hub, nudging Hinduvata content in the UK?  

I obviously understand that the political ties are such, that Israel needs to maintain a good relationship with Modi, for arms deals, and both parties have shared interest into humanising a very specific group.  

But all of us were born British (even the lost Christian boys).

So if we're talking about CVE, can we please be very clear?  

Any alt right nationalism is a risk to community- and identity-targeted extremist violence in the UK.  

You're clearly niching with it, and it's time- and event-specific, directed at users who match specific profiles. Given that most Hindus in the UK need to go to specialist stores for most ritual items, that these are highly seasonal where fruit is concerned, and as the calendar is complex it inherently ends up being searched online, it wouldn't be technically very difficult to do this, but it is targeting a population on racial terms and therefore it is unethical at best, and it is holocaust-adjacent at worst.  

so just to recap, in the last few hours, and I'm still on my period and I'm still not great, I have been exposed to dehumanisation of:
- British Jews
- British Muslims  
- British Hindus

I have witnessed microniched, pipelining content directed at British Hindus and British Jews.  

So again...  

How is PREVENT going, guys?  

üé™  

Fancy reviewing that IPA/RIPA warrant that isn't worth the paper it's written on, yet?  

I don't feel like I am The Problem.   

But as it's highly unlikely that you'll let it go and a number of you seem to be taking an opinion contrary to the official UK position on the matter?  

Free Palestine. üçâ  

Which:
- is not genocidal, and as a Palestinian reclaiming of a Likud (anti-Palestinian, part of the genocide evidence) slogan;  
- Calls for liberation on the Constitution of the state of Israel's own terms, the problem being that the Knesset consistently refuses to honour the constitution of the state of Israel saying that it's not legally binding, because if it was there would be no apartheid.

Does it not embarrass you all to support this?  

And not only to support it, but also to use bizarre non-arguments in the law to attempt to silence any criticism of it?  

Is there honestly not one single person who wants something better?  

I think the responses I got to surveillance and interference after leaving Wretched of the Earth on were very telling. And I think some the more racist charactatures have been very telling as well.  

It's worth understanding how processes like the ending of a part in South Africa we're actually a lot more violent for black South Africans than white South Africans; not every ending to colonialism (or as close to an ending as has been achieved) is going to be inherently violent in the same way that the ending of French rule in Algeria was, but it is worth noting that is because of the procursive violence, and because of the violence which escalated towards the end, which Fanon details extensively, that violence is colonial mimicry continues in the birth of or after liberation. I understand how terrifying that feels, to be in the position of the coloniser, and think well... what will happen to me? It's an incredibly hard set of feelings and I am not saying that this is inherently easy for you; it's not inherently easy for me. I'm a realist and pragmatist; transformational change has to happen, if we want to reduce that risk of violence. I know we can't help but be born in the place in time that we were. The thing is, the longer we keep a system in place which is brutally violent towards others, the greater the risk of violence we are ourselves prolonging. No one deserves to be in the cycle. If we are angry about European response to the holocaust, or the lack of real emancipation in the UK (although again I don't think the lost little Christian boys can really weigh in on that one), then deflecting the violence to someone else will never get us what we want.  

But that is a very complex argument and really I am just doing what a lot of people in behavioural insights in industry do -- I am simply putting data point one and data point two, together, and calling it a conclusion.  
I made a drawing conclusions of what seems familiar and similar, of my experience over time, and discussing patterns; sometimes I get on a tangent.  

And I've been thinking a lot about Iron Swords and Palestine recently.

previsely how many seconds did we last? until the masterbation confessions by content injection?  

again, for the millionth time:  

this person is not of the melanin-possessing variety. they are a one of me.  

and i'd be cool if we could just... not do this?  

it's giving the guy who got caught in a meeting and talked about on tv in 2020 energy.
