# 🩺 When Data Harm Becomes Physical Harm (Frailty Node)
**First created:** 2025-11-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*How data errors, silencing, and multi-agency drift manifest as real, measurable deterioration in physical health.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Data harm is often described as:
- administrative  
- bureaucratic  
- emotional  

But the downstream effects are physical.  
For disabled, chronically ill, or traumatised individuals, sustained data harm produces **frailty**.

This node explains how.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Links data harm to physical health decline  
- Maps frailty as a systems outcome  
- Connects silence-harm to nervous system deterioration  
- Supports clinical–governance understanding

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Chronic Data Harm = Chronic Stress Exposure  
Data harm produces:
- uncertainty  
- fear  
- loss of access to services  
- hypervigilance  
- medical destabilisation  

Chronic stress → systemic inflammation → frailty.

---

### 2. Silence-Harm Amplifies Physical Impact  
Silence triggers:
- cortisol spikes  
- autonomic dysregulation  
- disordered sleep  
- pain amplification  
- exacerbation of chronic illness  

Body becomes the “index” of system failure.

---

### 3. For Disabled People, Harm Accumulates Faster  
Existing conditions magnify:
- stress load  
- immune vulnerability  
- fatigue cycles  
- cardiovascular strain  

Even minor delays can cause major degradation.

---

### 4. Frailty as a Governance Metric  
Frailty signals:
- system failure  
- harm accumulation  
- repeated distress loops  
- declining resilience  

Frailty is a **structural outcome**, not a personal weakness.
