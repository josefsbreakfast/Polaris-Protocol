# 🧃 From Jetsons to Jailbroken — The Domestic Turn of Surveillance Capitalism  
**First created:** 2025-10-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-25  
*How the Internet of Things turned utopia inside out.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Once promised as the cheerful ease of the Jetsons — robotic assistants, frictionless life, leisure multiplied —  
the Internet of Things became the quiet colonisation of the domestic sphere.  

Each “smart” object entered the home with a smile and a sensor: the doorbell that reports visitors,  
the fridge that studies appetite, the speaker that listens for command tone.  
A century of design rhetoric about **labour-saving convenience** inverted into **data-serving compliance**.  

This node traces that reversal — from utopian marketing to infrastructural capture —  
and reads the home as the first laboratory of the **obedience economy**.

## 🧩 Key Sections  
1. **Utopian Marketing** — the Jetsonian promise of freedom through automation.  
2. **Domestic Capture** — how IoT converted intimacy into telemetry.  
3. **Appliance as Witness** — the home as the new workplace of surveillance.  
4. **☁️ When the Cloud Falls — The Day IoT Forgot the Internet** — AWS outage as revelation of dependence.  
5. **Jailbroken Futures** — small acts of repair, refusal, and re-sovereignty.

## 🧼 Utopian Marketing  

The early 2000s sold the *smart home* as emancipation: no more chores, no wasted time.  
Advertising borrowed directly from mid-century futurism — white surfaces, smiling women, invisible labour.  
The promise of automation disguised the question of **who** the machines would ultimately serve.  
The answer, it turned out, was *not* the household.  

Automation was not liberation but the embedding of the consumer into a permanent behavioural feedback loop.  
Convenience became the interface through which consent was silently renewed.

## 🏠 Domestic Capture  

The home became an always-on testing ground for behavioural data.  
Where the office had HR and the street had CCTV, the bedroom gained microphones.  
Each lightbulb, toothbrush, and thermostat joined the supply chain of visibility.  

Intimacy itself became an extractive frontier:  
- Energy usage inferred sleep and mood.  
- Voice assistants mined relational tone.  
- Kitchen routines profiled health and consumption.  

To live “smart” was to live *audited*.

## 🎙️ Appliance as Witness  

The surveillance state no longer needs wiretaps;  
it has the enthusiastic cooperation of consumer design.  
Objects testify silently, transmitting presence, tone, and timing.  
Their reports feed both the market and the machine.  

In the language of policing, the home has become **pre-incident space** —  
a theatre for the performance of compliance before suspicion even arises.

## ☁️ When the Cloud Falls — The Day IoT Forgot the Internet  

In late October 2025, an AWS outage briefly broke the fantasy of seamless connectivity.  
Doorbells fell silent, smart lights froze, and internet-enabled mattresses rebooted themselves in the night.  

As reported in *There Are No Girls on the Internet* (Bridget Todd, iHeart Podcasts, 24 Oct 2025),  
the glitch exposed the unspoken dependence of “smart” living on distant corporate clouds.  
Devices sold as autonomous turned out to be helpless once their remote servers blinked.  

The event made literal the metaphor: when the cloud falters, the home forgets who it is.  
What was marketed as convenience revealed itself as centralisation —  
a reminder that **resilience and autonomy begin with local control**.

## 🧵 Jailbroken Futures  

To jailbreak a device is to **reclaim authorship of function** — to restore choice where firmware forbade it.  
This spirit of modification echoes *anarchist calisthenics*:  
the practice of staying unpredictable inside systems that demand regularity.  

Future domestic ethics may depend on *micro-rebellions*:  
- refusing updates that over-collect,  
- buying “dumb” where possible,  
- building local-first, open-hardware alternatives.  

The goal is not nostalgia for an unplugged past, but a **re-domestication of technology** —  
bringing the household back under the moral governance of its inhabitants.
