# 🛰️ Low-Frequency Hum — Structural & Environmental Diagnostic Log  
**First created:** 2025-10-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-21  
*Field observations of monotone vibration through solid structures causing physical symptoms.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This log tracks low-frequency sound and vibration phenomena (20–120 Hz) perceptible through walls, floors, or objects.  
It helps distinguish **mechanical**, **electrical**, and **environmental** sources and document physiological effects such as headache, nausea, or ear pressure.

## 📋 Observation Checklist  

| Category | Indicators | Notes / Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Location** | Room / building section / materials in contact |  |
| **Perception type** | Heard / felt / pressure only |  |
| **Duration** | Continuous / intermittent / cyclic |  |
| **Time of day** | Start / stop times; pattern across days |  |
| **Vibration path** | Wall / floor / pipe / metal / furniture |  |
| **Pitch estimate** | Approx. Hz or note (A1 ≈ 55 Hz, etc.) |  |
| **Oscillation** | Steady / modulated / pulsing |  |
| **Equipment nearby** | HVAC, transformer, PC, fridge, water pump |  |
| **Power correlation** | Stops when mains off? |  |
| **Weather / external** | Wind / traffic / construction / trains |  |
| **Physiological** | Headache, pressure, dizziness, nausea |  |
| **Audio capture** | App used / FFT screenshot / decibel reading |  |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Identify perception] --> B{Audible or only felt?}
  B -->|Audible| C[Use FFT app to note frequency band]
  B -->|Felt only| D[Check for infrasound <20 Hz via vibration meter]
  C --> E{Constant or modulated?}
  D --> E
  E -->|Constant| F[Electrical or transformer hum likely]
  E -->|Modulated| G[Mechanical resonance or fluid oscillation]
  F --> H[Isolate by cutting circuits / unplugging devices]
  G --> I[Check HVAC, plumbing, nearby machinery]
  I --> J[If persists, test outdoors → environmental or infrastructure source]

## 🔍 Preliminary Source Codes  

| Code | Category | Likely Source | Mitigation Test |
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **LF-E01** | Electrical | Transformer / PSU / mains loop | Turn off circuits sequentially |
| **LF-M02** | Mechanical | Fan / pump / HVAC duct | Temporarily power down / decouple mounts |
| **LF-P03** | Plumbing | Flow resonance / water hammer | Run taps; listen for change |
| **LF-I04** | Infrastructure | Roadworks / substation / train | Note time & direction; contact local works |
| **LF-A05** | Acoustic environmental | Wind tunnel / building resonance | Change room or exit structure |
| **LF-U06** | Unidentified / mixed | Persistent cross-domain pattern | Continue log for 72 h |
