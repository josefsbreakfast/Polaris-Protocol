# 🟦 Teaching Framework: Jews, Empire, and Antisemitism  

## 1. Grounding the Conversation
- **Check-in:** What comes to mind when you hear “antisemitism”?  
- **Shared definitions:** Antisemitism is both:  
  - A *racism from outside* (stereotypes, exclusion, persecution).  
  - A *structural slot* Jews are pushed into (outsiders, middlemen, whitened, colonizers, scapegoated).  
- **Visual anchor:** Flow diagram: *Foreigners → Middlemen → Whitened / Still Suspect / Colonizers → Scapegoated.*  

---

## 2. Historical Layers
- **Medieval Europe:** Jews excluded from land/guilds, forced into moneylending and tax collection → scapegoated in crises.  
- **Atlantic World:** Sephardi Jews in Caribbean trade and slavery → small in scale but highly visible → resented as “foreign exploiters.”  
- **Colonial South Asia:** Baghdadi Jews (Sassoon, Ezra families) as imperial brokers → wealthy but never fully “British” or “Desi.”  
- **Israel/Palestine:** Zionism as survival → creation of new hierarchy: Ashkenazi dominance, Mizrahi subordination, Palestinians excluded.  
- **United States:** Ashkenazi Jews “whitened” post-WWII → Sephardi/Mizrahi and Jews of Color marginalized → Black–Jewish tensions shaped by middleman roles.

## 3. Key Tensions
- **Complicity vs. survival:** How to name Jewish roles in empire without feeding antisemitic tropes.  
- **Ashkenormativity:** Why Ashkenazi experience dominates UK, US, and Israeli Jewish institutions.  
- **Intra-Jewish racism:** Sephardi, Mizrahi, Baghdadi, and Jews of Color sidelined in community structures.  
- **Western/Christian gaze:** Jews remain suspect outsiders, even when whitened or empowered.

## 4. Reading & Reflection
- *Merchant of Venice* (Shylock): how we read him shows our stance on Jewish humanity.  
- James Baldwin, *Negroes are Anti-Semitic Because They’re Anti-White*: Black–Jewish tensions and whiteness.  
- Contemporary case: Ben-Gvir as Mizrahi politician performing hyper-nationalism under Ashkenazi dominance.  

---

## 5. Closing Practice
- **Personal reflection:** Where does my family/community story fit in the diagram?  
- **Collective reflection:** What does Jewish solidarity mean if we face both oppression and complicity?  
- **Forward action:** How to build antisemitism trainings that acknowledge intra-Jewish hierarchies and complicity honestly.

# 🟧 Capturing Sephardi, Mizrahi, Baghdadi, and Desi Jewish Threads  

## Why This Matters
Much of Jewish communal discourse in the West is **Ashkenormative** — centering Eastern European experiences of pogroms, Holocaust, and postwar whiteness. This erases or flattens other Jewish histories.  

## What We’ve Covered
- **Sephardi Jews:** Rooted in Iberia, Mediterranean, Ottoman worlds. Deeply diverse — not a single identity.  
- **Mizrahi Jews:** A modern Israeli catch-all label for Jews from Middle Eastern & North African lands. Useful politically at times, but homogenizing and colonial in origin. Many Jews prefer to identify specifically (Iraqi, Moroccan, Yemeni, etc.).  
- **Baghdadi Jews:** Merchant diaspora from Iraq to India, Burma, Singapore, Hong Kong. Wealthy elites (Sassoons, Ezras) tied to the British empire, yet always “Oriental outsiders.”  
- **Desi Jews:** Indigenous Jewish groups of South Asia — *Bene Israel* (Maharashtra) and *Cochin Jews* (Kerala). Rooted for centuries/millennia, but marginalized by both Baghdadis (as “too Indian”) and Ashkenazi Zionists (as “not modern enough”).  

## Internal Dynamics
- Elite Baghdadis looked down on Bene Israel and kept distance from Cochin Jews.  
- In Israel, Iraqi and other Mizrahi Jews faced systematic marginalization from the Ashkenazi establishment.  
- In the UK, Sephardi and Baghdadi voices are numerically small, structurally drowned out in the synagogue-based system of the Board of Deputies.  

## The Bigger Point
Jewish history is **not monolithic**.  
- Sephardi, Mizrahi, Baghdadi, and Desi Jews have their own trajectories — not reducible to “Ashkenazi victimhood” or “Mizrahi backwardness.”  
- Talking honestly about intra-Jewish hierarchies is not divisive; it is healing.  
- Until Jewish communities in the UK, US, and Israel fully integrate these narratives, antisemitism trainings will reinforce an Ashkenazi lens and miss the chance to build real solidarity.  

---

✨ In short:  
- Jews are not only victims of antisemitism, but also structurally tied into empire.  
- Jews are not one people with one history, but a tapestry of **diverse communities**, each positioned differently in colonial and modern hierarchies.  
- If we don’t bring **Sephardi, Mizrahi, Baghdadi, and Desi stories** to the center, we replicate the same exclusions empire imposed on us.
