# 🛰️ Risk Logic & the Disappearing Public Surgery  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*How security cultures have replaced access cultures in representative democracy.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Public surgeries were once the bedrock of democratic contact:  
walk-in, local, embodied, low-barrier.

But over the past decade, many representatives have adopted **risk logic** — a governance stance where safety frameworks override civic access.  
The result is a quiet structural shift from **public approachability** to **institutional defensiveness**.

This node examines how that shift has erased ordinary people from the spaces where they are supposed to be heard.

## ✨ Key Features  

- **Security First, Citizen Second**  
  Risk assessments, triage forms, ID checks, and pre-screening turn surgeries into controlled environments where spontaneity is treated as threat.

- **Appointment-Only Gatekeeping**  
  Appointments require literacy, tech access, confidence, and stability — systematically excluding disabled people, survivors, migrants, precarious workers.

- **Fear-Based Infrastructure**  
  Representatives increasingly see constituents through the lens of risk categories rather than as political relationships.

- **Shrinking Public Presence**  
  Surgeries move from open community spaces into securitised offices, inaccessible buildings, or online-only formats.

- **Uneven Hearing**  
  Those with institutional fluency or existing proximity retain voice; marginalised groups fall out of the audible range of governance entirely.

## 🧿 Analysis  
Risk logic operates on a simple inversion:

> **Instead of “How do we remain accessible to the public?”  
> the question becomes “How do we remain safe from the public?”**

This reorientation transforms democratic contact into a liability.  
In practice, it creates a cascade of civic silencing:

1. **Pre-screening filters out vulnerability**  
   People in crisis or distress often cannot navigate bureaucratic access pathways.

2. **Appointment systems privilege the resourced**  
   Access depends on administrative capacity rather than political need.

3. **Security posture heightens representative detachment**  
   Constituents become potential risks rather than human beings with grievances.

4. **Reduced visibility normalises absence**  
   Over time, the absence of embodied public engagement becomes politically invisible.

Risk logic therefore functions as a **containment structure**:  
it protects institutions from discomfort at the cost of democratic legitimacy.

The disappearance of public surgeries is not just an administrative shift —  
it is a **structural diminishment of political hearing**.
