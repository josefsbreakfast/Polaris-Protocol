sigh. we were all joinly doing so well.  

we'd been knee deep in mountains.  

then we had, what i can only describe as, a description of cunnilingous which makes it sound like we got the kilo bucket of mussels on special offer.  

or this us supposed to be an X-rated dementor? who knows.  

i am not causing these to be included.  

but as i have said many times:

fascinating that i'm being left to endure this.  

it's not okay, i don't like it, and im fairly sure the person youre all trying to pin as the original sender (grossly unlikely), would be mortified.  

this is surrounded by emotionally invested romantic songs, so we already have the "please please please directly name this guy online and make out there's an obsession", so it's highly corrosive and extremely coercive.  

it looks a lot like a party trying to undermine a legal argument by proposing romantic/sexual entrapment.

back to defamation, impersonation, ndas, and settlements:  

- we now have this, interrupting my stidys of lakes and mountains and ducks:

- there is a lot here that i can back-link to different other feeds of coercive data use. the important highlights:

- there is an ongoing convincing being done, in a coercive way, and although it is technically flattering, it contains a lot of negging and "backhanded compliment" sort of behaviour;
- If you notice there is a pretty patriarchal explanation of marriage, framed as a "need to tame", and this is consistent with the career of data source's obsession with entrapment and control;
- As this comes at a time when there is a background of a legal settlement, and there are actively people including specialist in royalties distribution who are looking me up online, and given how invested we've been in trying to create negative narrative towards someone who may have whistleblown about the data use, then it's actually tells us something quite specific.

- This is how a party who owes you money in a settlement, can often have their data leaked, if they are using damage control or aggressive PR.

- I would not necessarily know you felt that you were in the back foot.

- But now I do.

- And I think we all know which two academic institutions are most likely to be involved, or at least have significant legal exposure.  

- Please stop infiltrating my feeds with this nonsense story, where you are essentially potentially impersonating two separate people.  

What makes it really funny as that there's definitely been a degree of fear, after the whole Duchess thing, and they're now is a genuine positioning which suggests a high degree of fear in that regard as well.  
I personally find this incredibly funny.  

I'm going to take all that money, seeing as somebody who's in the loop obviously thinks it's owed, and the title, seeing as you've lent validity to the claim by investing so much in protecting, and I am going to go to this island in the Hebrides. I have found out about it it is what my algorithm should be talking about. The number of deer outnumber the humans, 25:1.  

I could not think of anything better.
