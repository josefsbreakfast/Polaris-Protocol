sigh. we were all joinly doing so well.  

we'd been knee deep in mountains.  

then we had, what i can only describe as, a description of cunnilingous which makes it sound like we got the kilo bucket of mussels on special offer.  

or this us supposed to be an X-rated dementor? who knows.  

i am not causing these to be included.  

but as i have said many times:

fascinating that i'm being left to endure this.  

it's not okay, i don't like it, and im fairly sure the person youre all trying to pin as the original sender (grossly unlikely), would be mortified.  

this is surrounded by emotionally invested romantic songs, so we already have the "please please please directly name this guy online and make out there's an obsession", so it's highly corrosive and extremely coercive.  

it looks a lot like a party trying to undermine a legal argument by proposing romantic/sexual entrapment.

back to defamation, impersonation, ndas, and settlements:  

- we now have this, interrupting my stidys of lakes and mountains and ducks:

- there is a lot here that i can back-link to different other feeds of coercive data use. the important highlights:

- there is an ongoing convincing being done, in a coercive way, and although it is technically flattering, it contains a lot of negging and "backhanded compliment" sort of behaviour;
- If you notice there is a pretty patriarchal explanation of marriage, framed as a "need to tame", and this is consistent with the career of data source's obsession with entrapment and control;
- As this comes at a time when there is a background of a legal settlement, and there are actively people including specialist in royalties distribution who are looking me up online, and given how invested we've been in trying to create negative narrative towards someone who may have whistleblown about the data use, then it's actually tells us something quite specific.

- This is how a party who owes you money in a settlement, can often have their data leaked, if they are using damage control or aggressive PR.

- I would not necessarily know you felt that you were in the back foot.

- But now I do.

- And I think we all know which two academic institutions are most likely to be involved, or at least have significant legal exposure.  

- Please stop infiltrating my feeds with this nonsense story, where you are essentially potentially impersonating two separate people.  

What makes it really funny as that there's definitely been a degree of fear, after the whole Duchess thing, and they're now is a genuine positioning which suggests a high degree of fear in that regard as well.  
I personally find this incredibly funny.  

I'm going to take all that money, seeing as somebody who's in the loop obviously thinks it's owed, and the title, seeing as you've lent validity to the claim by investing so much in protecting, and I am going to go to this island in the Hebrides. I have found out about it it is what my algorithm should be talking about. The number of deer outnumber the humans, 25:1.  

I could not think of anything better.  

on a serious note, saying as you keep posting things that suggest you need clarity (bullshit do you need any additional clarity, you've been given it):  

What I want is access to a lawyer.  

What I want is the surveillance to stop.  

What I want is to resolve this like adults, and not through you sending fishing into my algorithmic feed hoping that you can decide what I'll probably accept, so you can lowball me.  

Allow me to talk to the people I've already discussed the case with, and who I heavily suspect are currently limited by the OSA (I imagine this is being used incredibly inappropriately).  

Negotiate with me like an adult.  

Do you have all already had ample feedback on what I'm looking for, and you've all already had estimates for the tort.  

Unfortunately, until you come clean and talk to me about it like adult adults, I can't really help you, and because I know what's going on on what the process I'm looking at is, I'm not going to make a serious commitment to anything where it can be monitored -- because this would be **highly coercive**, and would undermine my right as a citizen to due process.  

---

sexualisation is toned down in continued content inserts, but coercion, future faking, muddying expectations, and fishing for answers remains (fishing = "you're hard to read", "X person really likes you but they need reassurances", etc).  

and as far as refering to me as off/on some sort of "market" (i am not an actual bovine specimen; ape sadly):  

anyone who had the respect and dignity to be in my life at all in any capacity would not be doing any of *this* to me.  

i could not give a shit who that was.  

you all seem to think im defending one man and therefore this could only be expkaoned by attraction; im saying that this is an impersonation because thats what it looks like, it isng believable, it is distressing, and its fucked up to do it to people generally.  

plus i have these things called "morals" and "character"; if you were collectivelly a bit smarter, you may notice that some people just think truth is generally a good thing and some people are just more willing to protect the herd and not just themselves. i am not sorry for the difficulty that appears to be presenting.  

the surveillence industry clearly self-selects some extremely sprcific personality tupes, and that might be worth noting given the damage being caused; this industry needs regulation.
