sigh. we were all joinly doing so well.  

we'd been knee deep in mountains.  

then we had, what i can only describe as, a description of cunnilingous which makes it sound like we got the kilo bucket of mussels on special offer.  

or this us supposed to be an X-rated dementor? who knows.  

i am not causing these to be included.  

but as i have said many times:

fascinating that i'm being left to endure this.  

it's not okay, i don't like it, and im fairly sure the person youre all trying to pin as the original sender (grossly unlikely), would be mortified.  

this is surrounded by emotionally invested romantic songs, so we already have the "please please please directly name this guy online and make out there's an obsession", so it's highly corrosive and extremely coercive.  

it looks a lot like a party trying to undermine a legal argument by proposing romantic/sexual entrapment.
