# 🏛️ Archetypes of Bureaucratic Behaviour  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*How bureaucracies slip into predictable narrative “modes” — The Hierophant, The Fog Machine, The Fortress, The Mirror Pool, The Tower, and The Soft Clerk — and how these archetypes shape survivor experience, decision-making, and institutional tone.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Bureaucracies behave in **archetypal patterns**.

Not because staff believe in myths.  
Because large institutions under pressure naturally collapse into familiar shapes — symbolic behaviours that repeat across governments, councils, universities, and safeguarding systems.

These behaviours determine:

- how fast decisions move  
- how warm or cold staff appear  
- whether rules tighten or loosen  
- whether support is reachable  
- how risk is perceived  
- how survivors are interpreted  

This node maps key bureaucratic archetypes that appear in moments of stress, transition, or institutional uncertainty.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Identifies 6 core bureaucratic behaviour archetypes  
- Shows how each archetype emerges from risk posture  
- Describes effects on survivors, staff, and decision flow  
- Connects archetypes to institutional weather systems  
- Provides diagnostic markers for recognising each mode  
- Helps decode bureaucratic behaviour without personalising it
