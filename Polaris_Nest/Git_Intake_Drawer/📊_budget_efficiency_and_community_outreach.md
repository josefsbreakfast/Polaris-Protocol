*Airshows, optics, and the economics of spectacle.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
If you can’t do it, dazzle them while not doing it. The RAF perfected “public-private levitation partnerships”: large-scale displays of national pride that double as smoke screens for procurement anomalies.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Strategic Spectacle:** when the jets roar, nobody reads the spreadsheets.
- **Perception as Yield:** patriotism measured in decibels.
- **Community Outreach:** distract the townsfolk from the Army’s latest 'battlefield-engineering' experiment.

## 🧿 Analysis  
The airshow functions as fiscal theatre: convert aviation fuel into civic goodwill. In the ministry’s accounting logic, emotional resonance is a recoverable asset. Containment via applause.
