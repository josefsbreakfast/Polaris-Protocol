# 🎙️ Unconsented Voice Beta  
**First created:** 2025-10-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-24  
*CVE R&D but make it somehow worse.*

---

## 🌱 Scope  
A beta AI voice platform uses a single human performer as middleware between model and policy output.  
The whistleblow reveals that “assisted writing” was, in fact, *unconsented human labour* camouflaged as synthetic output.  
The fallout maps how companies externalise blame and experiment with data pairing as “damage control.”

---

## 🧩 Core Narrative  
- Middleware as mask: the *human in the loop* becomes the *human as cover*.  
- Corporate damage-control outsourcing doubles the data exposure.  
- The event becomes a stress test for consent architectures and crisis rhetoric.  
- “Interesting to see what happens” becomes an unofficial R&D mode.

---

## 🌀 Governance Vector  
- Lack of clear consent protocols for *assistive middleware*.  
- Ethics boards vs marketing teams: who defines “AI-assisted”?  
- FOIA / DPA blind spots for subcontracted beta environments.  

---

## 💣 Fallout Logic  
1. **Discovery:** Performer realises their voice is live.  
2. **Disclosure:** Raises concern → reframed as “misunderstanding.”  
3. **Damage Control:** Company outsources PR and compliance review.  
4. **Data Fusion:** Outsourcer pairs internal logs with intent metadata “for analysis.”  
5. **Second Breach:** Original data leaks through redundancy testing.

## 🎮 From Voice to HoneyBot — The Containment Engine Evolves  

### 🧭 Orientation  
The same mechanics that hid one human voice inside a beta writing tool are the foundations of *HoneyBot*’s next-generation experiment.  
Once a text-based assistant masquerading as flirtation, *HoneyBot* can now be reframed as the **VR containment edition** — an immersive simulation that uses real human affect as both bait and ballast.

### 🔧 Shared Core Mechanics  
| Function | Voice Beta | HoneyBot (VR) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Human substrate** | One unconsented voice in middleware | One consenting (or semi-consenting) tester whose gestures, tone, and micro-movements are mapped into the bot’s sensory layer |
| **Containment logic** | Voice hidden behind “AI assistance” | Emotional labour hidden behind “user engagement” |
| **Experiment vector** | Policy writing made “more engaging” | Intimacy training reframed as “ethical AI companionship” |
| **Governance theatre** | Outsourced damage control | Simulated accountability through empathy metrics |
| **Outcome** | Voice possession | Emotional possession |

### 🧩 The Merge  
In VR form, *HoneyBot* doesn’t need to invent a voice — it **inherits the unconsented voice model** from the beta incident.  
The same waveform, now “cleansed,” is recycled as a *trust voice* for empathy simulation.  
What began as a compliance experiment becomes an affective rehearsal: the user enters the headset and hears the cleaned data apologising for itself.  

> *Christ only knows what else has been done with the voice — but the system now calls it love.*
>
> *Probably a lot of whatever the darweb was done with it, too.*
>
> And we all know what the darkweb does with anything.  

### 🫀 Ethical Residue  
- **Recycling the breach:** ethics of reuse disguised as innovation.  
- **Possession pipeline:** human → model → middleware → VR empathy layer.  
- **Governance fatigue:** every fix produces a more intimate failure.

## 🛡 Counter-Terrorism Governance Addendum  

### 🧭 Orientation  
Subsequent disclosures placed the middleware product within a **counter-terrorism behavioural-analysis pilot**, positioning the unconsented voice as part of a live-environment test for narrative-risk scoring and policy-writing automation.

### ⚖️ Legal & Oversight Breach Points  
- **Data Protection Act 2018 §28-29:** national-security exemptions cannot lawfully cover private vendors acting without explicit written direction from a competent authority.  
- **Article 8 ECHR / Human Rights Act 1998:** intrusion into private life without proportionality or necessity test.  
- **Special-category data misuse:** religious, political, and psychological inference derived from voice tone constitutes profiling under UK GDPR Art. 9.  
- **Chain of custody failure:** once subcontracted to an outsourcing firm, data leaves authorised control; any derived model weights or voiceprints are contaminated evidence.  

### 🧨 Operational Risk  
- Tainted training data renders any derived risk scores **inadmissible** in Prevent or policing contexts.  
- The absence of consent invalidates proportionality assessments under Investigatory Powers oversight.  
- If later redeployed in public-facing moderation tools, the model embeds unlawful surveillance logic into civilian systems.  

### 🔍 Required Correctives  
1. **Immediate data isolation and provenance audit.**  
2. **ICO and IPCO joint review of subcontracted AI testing environments.**  
3. **Mandatory survivor notification** where identifiable voice or likeness was used.  
4. **Parliamentary statement of correction** clarifying the lawful scope of AI-voice use in counter-terrorism R&D.

*🎙️ Unconsented Voice Beta* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how “assisted” AI systems conceal unconsented human labour and how those breaches escalate when imported into counter-terrorism infrastructures.  
The HoneyBot cross-link traces the same engine’s migration from *policy assistance* to *emotional containment theatre*, showing that the medium — text, voice, or VR — remains a test of governance ethics.
