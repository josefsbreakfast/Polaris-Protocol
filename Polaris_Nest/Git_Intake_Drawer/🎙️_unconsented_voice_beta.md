# 🎙️ Unconsented Voice Beta  
**First created:** 2025-10-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*CVE R&D but make it somehow worse.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

A beta AI voice platform uses a single human performer as middleware between model and policy output. The whistleblow reveals that “assisted writing” was, in fact, *unconsented human labour* camouflaged as synthetic output. The fallout maps how companies externalise blame and experiment with data pairing as “damage control.”  

---

## 🧩 Core Narrative  

- Middleware as mask: the *human in the loop* becomes the *human as cover*.  
- Corporate damage‑control outsourcing doubles the data exposure.  
- The event becomes a stress test for consent architectures and crisis rhetoric.  
- “Interesting to see what happens” becomes an unofficial R&D mode.

---

## 🌀 Governance Vector  

- Lack of clear consent protocols for *assistive middleware*.  
- Ethics boards vs marketing teams: who defines “AI‑assisted”?  
- FOIA / DPA blind spots for subcontracted beta environments.

---

## 💣 Fallout Logic  

1. **Discovery:** Performer realises their voice is live.  
2. **Disclosure:** Raises concern → reframed as “misunderstanding.”  
3. **Damage Control:** Company outsources PR and compliance review.  
4. **Data Fusion:** Outsourcer pairs internal logs with intent metadata “for analysis.”  
5. **Second Breach:** Original data leaks through redundancy testing.

## 🎮 From Voice to HoneyBot — The Containment Engine Evolves  

### 🧭 Orientation  

The same mechanics that hid one human voice inside a beta writing tool are the foundations of *HoneyBot*’s next‑generation experiment. Once a text‑based assistant masquerading as flirtation, *HoneyBot* can now be reframed as the **VR containment edition** — an immersive simulation that uses real human affect as both bait and ballast.

### 🔧 Shared Core Mechanics  

| Function                     | Voice Beta                              | HoneyBot (VR)                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Human substrate              | One unconsented voice in middleware      | One consenting (or semi‑consenting) tester’s gestures, tone, micro‑movements |
| Containment logic            | Voice hidden behind “AI assistance”      | Emotional labour hidden behind “user engagement” |
| Experiment vector            | Policy writing made “more engaging”      | Intimacy training reframed as “ethical AI companionship” |
| Governance theatre           | Outsourced damage control                | Simulated accountability through empathy metrics |
| Outcome                      | Voice possession                         | Emotional possession |

### 🧩 The Merge  

In VR form, *HoneyBot* inherits the unconsented voice model from the beta incident. The same waveform, now “cleansed,” is recycled as a *trust voice* for empathy simulation. What began as a compliance experiment becomes an affective rehearsal: the user enters the headset and hears the cleaned data apologising for itself.

> *"Who knows what else has been done with the voice — but the system now calls it love.*  
> *Probably a lot of whatever the darkweb was done with it, too.*  
> *And we all know what the darkweb does with anything."*  

### 🫀 Ethical Residue  

- **Recycling the breach:** ethics of reuse disguised as innovation.  
- **Possession pipeline:** human → model → middleware → VR empathy layer.  
- **Governance fatigue:** every fix produces a more intimate failure.

## 🛡 Counter‑Terrorism Governance Addendum  

### 🧭 Orientation  

Subsequent disclosures placed the middleware product within a **counter‑terrorism behavioural‑analysis pilot**, positioning the unconsented voice as part of a live‑environment test for narrative‑risk scoring and policy‑writing automation.

### ⚖️ Legal & Oversight Breach Points  

- **Data Protection Act 2018 §§28‑29:** national‑security exemptions cannot lawfully cover private vendors acting without explicit written direction from a competent authority.  
- **Article 8 ECHR / Human Rights Act 1998:** intrusion into private life without proportionality or necessity test.  
- **Special‑category data misuse:** religious, political, and psychological inference derived from voice tone constitutes profiling under UK GDPR Art. 9.  
- **Chain of custody failure:** once subcontracted to an outsourcing firm, data leaves authorised control; any derived model weights or voiceprints are contaminated evidence.

### 🧨 Operational Risk  

- Tainted training data renders any derived risk scores **inadmissible** in Prevent or policing contexts.  
- Absence of consent invalidates proportionality assessments under Investigatory Powers oversight.  
- If later redeployed in public‑facing moderation tools, the model embeds unlawful surveillance logic into civilian systems.

### 🔍 Required Correctives  

1. Immediate data isolation and provenance audit.  
2. ICO and IPCO joint review of subcontracted AI testing environments.  
3. Mandatory survivor notification where identifiable voice or likeness was used.  
4. Parliamentary statement of correction clarifying the lawful scope of AI‑voice use in counter‑terrorism R&D.

*🎙️ Unconsented Voice Beta* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**. It documents how “assisted” AI systems conceal unconsented human labour and how those breaches escalate when imported into counter‑terrorism infrastructures. The HoneyBot cross‑link traces the same engine’s migration from *policy assistance* to *emotional containment theatre*, showing that the medium — text, voice, or VR — remains a test of governance ethics.
