# 🧮 **Forensic Transparency Toolkit — Donor & Capital Mapping**  
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-11  
*A civic-tech blueprint for mapping donor holdings, capital flows, sectoral influence, and ideological alignment using only open-data sources.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node outlines a practical, OSINT-safe method for tracing how funding, equity, and influence flow through donors, corporations, charities, political movements, and ideological networks.

The goal is not to expose private individuals.  
The goal is to **map structural incentives**:

- Which donors have money in addictive / behavioural-manipulation industries?  
- Which foundations overlap with surveillance tech, fossil capital, or culture-war ecosystems?  
- Which think tanks share board members with extractive markets?  
- Which “philanthropists” have portfolios geared towards destabilisation?  

This toolkit uses **public, regulated data only** — making it legally safe, open-source, and verifiable.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 🗂️ 1. The Problem This Solves  
Current donor transparency is:

- fragmented  
- siloed across jurisdictions  
- obfuscated by shell orgs  
- hidden in corporate filings  
- sometimes deliberately structured for plausible deniability  

This makes it incredibly difficult to see patterns like:

- how “moderate” think tanks are financed by extremist-adjacent capital  
- how harassment or culture-war activity overlaps with specific industries  
- how tiny donations mask huge ideological or financial stakes  

A proportional, cross-indexed system solves this.

### 🧮 2. Data Sources (All Public & Legal)  

**United Kingdom**  
- **Companies House** (director listings, PSC, filings)  
- **Charity Commission Register** (trustees, finances, related entities)  
- **Electoral Commission** (political donations, loans)  
- **FCA listings** (for regulated investment firms)

**United States**  
- **SEC / EDGAR** (13F filings for institutional holdings)  
- **IRS 990 forms** (charity & foundation disclosures)

**Europe & Global**  
- National corporate registries  
- Transparency registers  
- Annual reports  
- Market disclosures  

This is the raw material — already public, but rarely unified.
