## Layered Countermeasure Table  

| **Layer**        | **Risks of Twinning**                               | **Untwinning Methods**                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data layer**   | Deterministic linkages across databases (NHS no., NI no., IMEI). | - Noise injection (address formats, spelling variants)<br>- Context-specific IDs<br>- Subject access & correction requests |
| **Governance**   | Policy collapse: safeguarding + counter-extremism conflated; high-payoff targeting. | - Legal firewalls between domains<br>- Independent audits of data flow<br>- GDPR & human rights litigation |
| **Platform**     | Cross-platform profiling; shadowbans & visibility throttling. | - Different handles/phones per platform<br>- Shadowban detection tools<br>- Collective complaints forcing unlinks |
| **Social**       | Adjacency effects (family, contacts chilled).        | - Collective masking (group speech)<br>- Misdirection campaigns to dilute link value |
| **Technical**    | Persistent identifiers trace across services.        | - Disposable IDs / identity firewalls<br>- Encryption & anonymisation layers<br>- Federated or peer-to-peer alternatives |

## Examples of Untwinning in Practice  

- **Multiple SIMs / burners** → activists separating devices to avoid one IMEI pinning all activity.  
- **Alternative spellings of names** → migrants and diaspora communities creating natural mismatches across systems.  
- **Shadowban testing tools** → journalists proving visibility suppression to force platform unlinks.  
- **Virtual debit cards & email aliases** → breaking purchase and sign-up chains.  
- **Collective masking** → campaigns flooding systems with identical data (“We are all ___”).  
- **Policy wins** → NHS data firewall after the Windrush scandal; French silo laws separating health and policing data.

## 🧾 Field Sign: The Toilet Roll Effect  

When twinning weakens, systems lose confidence in who you are.  
Instead of targeted suppression or hyper-personalised ads, you start seeing **generic, repetitive adverts** (toilet roll, groceries, household goods).  

- This is a sign that the profile being sold on you is **unstable**.  
- Advertisers fall back on “safe bets” when they can’t pin your identity.  
- Annoying? Yes. But it means the surveillance net is slipping.  

> **Survivor read:**  
> If the system is obsessed with selling you toilet roll, it’s because it no longer knows what else to sell you.

## Notes  

- **Untwinning ≠ erasure.** Once linked, data usually persists. The aim is to make links unreliable, contested, and costly to act upon.  
- Effectiveness increases when **multiple layers** are combined (technical + legal + social).  
- **Survivor priority:** protect the ability to speak, organise, and move without disproportionate penalty.

*Untwinning Data* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents strategies to resist and dismantle suppressive record-linkages across domains.
