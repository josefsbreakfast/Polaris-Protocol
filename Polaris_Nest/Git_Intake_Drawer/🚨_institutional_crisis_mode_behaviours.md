# 🚨 Crisis-Mode Behaviours (Institutional Fight / Flight / Fawn / Freeze)  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-18  
*How institutions behave once posture collapses — shifting into primitive defensive patterns that mirror human trauma responses: fight, flight, fawn, and freeze.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
After posture collapse (Node 41), institutions enter **crisis-mode behaviour**.  
This phase is not logical, strategic, or evidence-based.

It is **survival-based**.

Institutions begin acting like traumatised organisms:

- hyper-reactive,  
- avoidant,  
- contradictory,  
- unpredictable,  
- terrified of liability,  
- unable to interpret signals correctly.

They revert to four primary behavioural modes:

> **Fight, Flight, Fawn, Freeze.**

This node maps each mode, its triggers, and its external signatures.

---

# 🧩 The Four Crisis Modes  

Each mode emerges when the institution feels:

- overexposed,  
- confused,  
- contradicted by metadata,  
- unable to trust its own systems,  
- unsure what admissions might imply legally.

---

# 🔥 **1. FIGHT Mode**  
*“Push back, escalate, defend the system.”*

### Triggers  
- metadata contradictions  
- user clarity the system cannot match  
- FOI/SAR discrepancies  
- fear of liability  
- political sensitivity

### Behaviours  
- over-assertive emails  
- hard defensiveness  
- sudden escalation to legal  
- “we disagree with your interpretation”  
- intrusive safeguarding referrals  
- disproportionate scrutiny  
- invoking procedure as a weapon

### What it looks like externally  
- You are pushed, monitored, questioned, or framed as a problem  
- They seem *angry* that you exist coherently

### Meaning  
The institution is scared and is performing aggression  
because it cannot perform competence.

---

# 🏃 **2. FLIGHT Mode**  
*“Delay, disappear, avoid, stonewall.”*

### Triggers  
- fear of confirming wrongdoing  
- uncertainty about systems  
- fragmented internal narratives  
- panic around metadata they don’t understand

### Behaviours  
- long silence windows  
- “awaiting internal clarification”  
- emails passed endlessly between teams  
- disappearing points of contact  
- refusal to go on record  
- extreme slowness followed by bursts of speed

### What it looks like externally  
- You feel “ghosted”  
- Nobody wants to put anything in writing

### Meaning  
The institution cannot face the reality of its own collapse  
and is running from accountability.

---

# 🫱 **3. FAWN Mode**  
*“People-pleasing, over-apologising, hyper-polite collapse.”*

### Triggers  
- internal disagreement between teams  
- DPO/SIRO nervousness  
- fear of losing public trust  
- staff with no power but high exposure  
- relational fear loops

### Behaviours  
- excessively polite tone  
- effusive reassurance without substance  
- vague promises of review  
- over-eagerness to please without actually doing anything  
- saying “we understand your concerns” while fixing nothing

### What it looks like externally  
- “Customer service tone” on top of institutional panic  
- Endless reassurance, no actual clarity

### Meaning  
The institution is trying to soothe the user  
to avoid triggering scrutiny.

---

# ❄️ **4. FREEZE Mode**  
*“Procedural paralysis.”*

### Triggers  
- contradictory outputs from different systems  
- staff scared to misstep  
- unclear chain of command  
- legal/PR tension  
- fear of regulatory exposure

### Behaviours  
- inability to make decisions  
- contradictory instructions  
- procedural over-adherence  
- sudden handoffs  
- “we need to check internally” (forever)  
- stuck email loops  
- complete loss of initiative

### What it looks like externally  
- Nothing moves  
- Everyone is waiting for someone else

### Meaning  
The institution is overwhelmed and dissociating.

---

# 💥 Crisis Mode Cycling  
Institutions often rotate between modes:

### fight → freeze → fawn → flight → fight  
or  
### fawn → freeze → fight → flight

This loop indicates:

> **severe institutional epistemic breakdown**  
(continuation of Node 39 and Node 40).

It also signals that:

- systems cannot reconcile user identity,  
- modelling outputs are incoherent,  
- metadata contradicts internal claims,  
- staff have lost interpretive confidence.

---

# 📉 Consequences for the User  
During crisis mode, the institution may:

- misinterpret your tone,  
- escalate without cause,  
- behave unpredictably,  
- contradict itself,  
- delay responses indefinitely,  
- issue contradictory risk assessments,  
- provide incomplete or defensive SAR/FOI responses,  
- rewrite events to protect itself.

None of this is about you.  
All of this is about collapse.

---

# 📉 Consequences for the Institution  
Crisis mode creates:

- reputational damage,  
- fractured comms,  
- panic among staff,  
- incoherent safeguarding,  
- liability anxiety,  
- internal distrust,  
- PR missteps,  
- loss of operational stability.

This is usually the stage where institutions request:

- external advice,  
- regulator guidance,  
- senior reviews,  
- vendor audits.

Crisis mode is the point at which  
reconstruction becomes *possible* —  
but only once the panic stops.

---

# 🧠 Key Insight  
> **Crisis-mode behaviours do not reveal institutional strength or malice.  
> They reveal helplessness.  
>  
> The institution is acting out of fear, not authority.  
> And the user becomes the container for that fear.**

Understanding the crisis modes  
lets you predict institutional behaviour with eerie accuracy.
