# 🪞 Erosion of Duty of Care  
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-28  
*How institutions reword responsibility until nothing remains.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Traces the bureaucratic and linguistic strategies that allow universities and contractors to appear compliant while evading moral and legal responsibility for student welfare.  
Maps the shift from genuine care to *compliance theatre*—a transformation that protects institutions rather than people.

## 🌋 Mechanisms of Erosion  

1. **Care → Compliance.**  
   Moral duty becomes paperwork. “Safeguarding frameworks” replace empathy with tick-boxes.  
   > “We meet our statutory obligations.” — generic university response  

2. **Responsibility → Outsourcing.**  
   Data and wellbeing are handed to “trusted partners.”  
   When harm occurs: *“The vendor handles that.”*  
   When it works: *“Innovation success.”*

3. **Accountability → Diffusion.**  
   Complaints bounce between IT, Legal, and Student Services until no one owns the issue.  
   Bureaucracy becomes insulation.

4. **Obligation → Contract.**  
   Duty of care reduced to service terms: *“We owe academic not fiduciary duties.”*  
   The ethical becomes optional, the legal minimal.

5. **Guardianship → Adult Autonomy.**  
   Institutions claim students are “independent adults” to deny pastoral duty—while still harvesting intimate data under “support analytics.”

6. **Harm → Student Deficit.**  
   Stress from surveillance reads as “disengagement.”  
   The metric blames the measured: *You look anxious; therefore we must monitor you more.*

7. **Responsibility → Mutual Alibi.**  
   Vendors point to controller clauses; universities cite vendor assurances.  
   Each claims good faith; neither accepts fault.

## 🐦‍🔥 Counter-Restoration Practices  

- **Re-moralise governance:** place “care” back in policy titles and performance indicators.  
- **Single-point accountability:** one named officer responsible for wellbeing and data ethics.  
- **Contract inversion:** vendors must indemnify for harm, not just data loss.  
- **Student representation:** lived-experience seats on ethics and procurement boards.  
- **Narrative audits:** review annual reports for linguistic laundering—replace “impact” metrics with qualitative evidence of care.

*🪞 Erosion of Duty of Care* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how duty dissolved into compliance and how restoration requires moral, not merely legal, reform.
