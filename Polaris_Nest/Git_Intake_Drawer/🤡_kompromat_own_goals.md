**First created:** 2025-12-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-08  
*How bad actors sabotage themselves while attempting to incriminate others.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Kompromat fails in predictable ways.  
The most common is the “own-goal”: an attempt to shame, threaten, or blackmail a target that inadvertently discloses the sender’s insecurities, misunderstandings, or operational ineptitude.

This node catalogues the structural comedy of these failures.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Extraneous incriminating details that incriminate the sender  
- Overconfident misreading of metadata or search exhaust  
- Emotional leakage disguised as accusation  
- Narrative seams large enough to drive a bus through

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. **Why Own-Goals Happen**  
Actors with partial technical knowledge believe possessing a fragment of data equals possessing leverage.  
They skip verification, misunderstanding both context and meaning.

### 2. **The Ego-Compulsion Loop**  
An actor attempts to “land a blow” by adding a flourish: a humiliating or intimate detail.  
The detail is autobiographical.  
They cannot help themselves.

### 3. **The Mask-Slip Moment**  
The unnecessary detail introduces an inconsistency only explainable by projection.  
Readers experience the distinctive “oh no, sweetheart” sensation.

### 4. **Operational Aftermath**  
The message becomes evidence — not against the target, but against the fabricator, whose psychological and technical fingerprints now lie in plain sight.
