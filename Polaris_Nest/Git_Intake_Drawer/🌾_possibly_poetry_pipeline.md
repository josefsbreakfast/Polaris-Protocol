## 🧭 Orientation  
*A case study in how a machine confuses holiness with hazard, and bureaucracy mistakes compassion for code.*  
This node follows a devotional text’s journey through an automated threat-detection system.  
Each misclassification exposes how containment architectures build their own myths.

## 🗺️ False-Positive Map  

| Stage | Machine Read | Human Read | True Function |  
|:--|:--|:--|:--|  
| Automated ingest → Human review | Hebrew blessing → multilingual flag | Omer counting | Seasonal mindfulness ritual |  
| Keyword parser → Entity correlation | “Palestinians,” “Boundaries,” “Power” | Ethical prayers | Penitential theology |  
| Visual hash → Context model | Symbolic hands, grain imagery | Ritual iconography | Public-domain devotional art |  
| Sentiment scan → Human moderation | “compassion,” “repentance,” “wheat” | Prayer and reflection | **BENIGN : WHEAT** |  

> *Ticket note → “Possibly Poetry.”*

## 🗃️ Incident Logs (PP-010 → PP-013)

### PP-010 | Excessive Compassion  
Flagged for compassion; cleared as Judaism.  

### PP-011 | Force of Chaos & Kindness  
Power × 9; theology misread as manifesto.  

### Field Recording | Internal Chat  
```
#compliance-review
Analyst A:  Getting repeat alerts on “Force of Chaos and Kindness.”  Keyword hits: power ×9, chaos ×2, kindness ×4, wheat ×1.  
Analyst B:  Opened — it’s Omer counting again. Literal grain-tracking, metaphorical character refinement. No indicators of mobilisation.  
Analyst C:  Wait — literal wheat?  
Supervisor:  Tag **BENIGN : WHEAT** and close the ticket.
```  

### PP-013 | The Agrarian Concern  
Recurring terms “wheat,” “harvest,” “barn,” and “Stardew” misread as small-scale cultivation network.  
Resolution → *No illicit agriculture detected — subject appears to be playing a video game.*

## 💸 Omer Budget Annex  
*A mock government spending brief: the price of over-interpretation.*  

| Role | Day Rate | Time | Cost per Post |  
|:--|:--|:--|:--|  
| Linguist / Translator | £450–£700 | ½ day | £225–£350 |  
| Religious-Studies Consultant | £300–£600 | ½ day | £150–£300 |  
| Political-Risk Analyst | £500–£800 | ¼ day | £125–£200 |  
| Data Scientist | £600–£1 000 | ¼ day | £150–£250 |  
| Managerial / Admin Overhead | — | — | £100–£200 |  

**Total per post:** £750–£1 300  → × 40 days ≈ £30 000–£50 000  
spent to prove the poet was counting metaphorical wheat.

## ⚙️ Guard-Rail Failure Cascade  
*How an unchecked classifier escalates harmless data.*  

| Stage | System Behaviour | Intended Process | When Guard-Rails Fail |  
|:--|:--|:--|:--|  
| 1 Model Confidence → Fact | Classifier assigns risk score | Human checks context | Score treated as truth; label becomes metadata |  
| 2 Label Propagation | Flag shared with partners | Only verified flags propagate | Flag copied everywhere |  
| 3 Feedback Loop | Flag draws more scrutiny → more data | Reset confidence after review | System counts curiosity as evidence |  
| 4 Jurisdictional Drift | Case passed across agencies | One agency closes it | Each hand-off adds classification |  
| 5 Human Fatigue | Analysts overloaded | Sample or triage | “Clear nothing or everything” rule takes over |  
| 6 Budget Gravity | Team attached to risk code | Resource review removes empties | No one admits it’s fiction |  
| 7 Reputation Echo | Profile replicates elsewhere | Tags expire automatically | “Interesting” → “High risk” by inertia |  

> *Without intervention, the machine builds a self-referential myth: the threat exists because the system spent money proving it did.*  

**Mitigations:** human-in-the-loop verification · explainable-AI logs · proportionality audits · flag decay · and the occasional analyst who says, “Mate, it’s wheat again.”

## 🧩 Runaway Classification Loop  

| Loop | Description | Intervention Point |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| Technical Mis-fit | Multilingual cyclic text → algorithm uncertainty → high risk | Add cultural / linguistic SME review |  
| Procedural Escalation | Analyst marks “high” so someone else will read → confirmation bias | Justification + second sign-off |  
| Political Context | High threat climate → no one wants to de-escalate | Independent oversight · flag-decay timer |  

**Outcome without guard-rails →** Classification Lock-In  
**Outcome with guard-rails →** Reclassified as Devotional Poetry – Low Risk

## 🌾 Classified : Wheat Poetry  

| Field | Entry |  
|:--|:--|  
| **File Code** | PPP-014-CW |  
| **Subject** | “Counting Wheat” devotional entries (Apr–May 2025) |  
| **Finding** | Non-hostile · Religious · Artistic content — flag resolved |  
| **Final Label** | **BENIGN : WHEAT** |  

After multi-agency review and one consultation with agricultural experts,  
the content formerly categorised as “Possible coded transmissions”  
has been determined to describe **ritual grain-counting and ethical self-reflection.**  

**Re-classification → *Cultural / Spiritual Practice — Low Risk, High Compassion*.**  

> *Flagged for excessive compassion; cleared as Judaism.*
