**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How Guantánamo Bay shattered the West’s post-WWII ethical identity and normalised administrative torture.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node argues that Guantánamo Bay was the **hinge-point** where the West abandoned its post-Holocaust commitment to human rights, publicly and permanently.  
It marks the moment torture changed from a secret shame to an **administrative tool with paperwork**.

## 🧩 Structural Outline  

### 1. Post-Holocaust Ethical Architecture  
- Nuremberg principles  
- Geneva Conventions  
- “Never Again” as civic mythology

### 2. The Gitmo Break  
- “Enhanced interrogation” as linguistic betrayal  
- Black sites → public sites  
- Legal memos as moral camouflage

### 3. Bureaucratic Cruelty  
- Torture scheduled  
- Doctors as instruments  
- JAG law as moral theatre

### 4. Export & Contagion  
- Allies adopt the logic  
- Torture becomes part of counter-terrorism brand  
- Israel’s detention practices downstream from US exception model

### 5. Collapse of Western Self-Image  
- Democratic identity hollowed  
- Complicity becomes common sense  
- Silence becomes civic duty
