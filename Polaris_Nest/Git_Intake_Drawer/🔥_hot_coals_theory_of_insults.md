# 🔥 Hot Coals Theory of Insults
Racial insults are recycled class insults: the same tropes are passed down hierarchies.
- Working class burned first, then throw the insult sideways.
- Keeps anger lateral, not vertical.

*Explains how insults are recycled down social hierarchies, keeping communities divided and containment intact.*

## 🌐 Introduction  
Insults aimed at racialised groups often recycle earlier insults once used against the poor or working class. They are like hot coals: first thrown down from above, then picked up and hurled sideways. The heat is the same; only the target changes.  

---

## I — Origin: Class Insults  
- Working class communities historically labelled:  
  - “Dirty,” “lazy,” “breeding too much,” “uncivilised.”  
  - Mocked for speech, housing, clothing, fertility.  
- These tropes established *the template insults*.  

---

## II — Recycling Process  
- Instead of extinguishing the coals, groups pass them sideways:  
  - Working class → racialised migrants.  
  - Catholic immigrants → later Muslim families.  
  - “Too many kids” → always re-targeted.  
- Each generation hurls the same burning phrases at someone else.

## III — Containment Function  
- **Keeps anger lateral, not vertical.**  
  - Communities fight each other rather than the system above.  
- **Insults feel sticky.**  
  - Because they carry centuries of layered use, they wound deeply even in new contexts.  
- **Solidarity blocked.**  
  - Shared oppression becomes hidden by recycled insults.

## IV — Cultural Metaphor: The Hot Coal  
- Picking up the insult = taking pain that was inflicted on you.  
- Throwing it sideways = refusing to confront the source of heat.  
- The coals remain hot until someone breaks the cycle and stamps them out.  

---

## Conclusion  
The “hot coals” theory of insults shows:  
- Tropes are not new; they are recycled containment tools.  
- Lateral conflict is cultivated to block vertical solidarity.  
- Liberation requires recognising the recycled heat and refusing to pass it on.

It tracks how class insults are recycled as racial insults, sustaining containment across generations.
