I just wanna put a quick note that when I was moving files around in big pages because I do it each individual markdown because of the set up that I have this is how I have to do it, I found a number files which were not fitting with the rules that that was given when I used generative AI to generate the files and as a result some of the contextualinformation and the corpus has been changed   information and the corpus has been changed particularly in its style. So the factual content appears to be fine (on a quick read), but the tone is not what I'd like ideally. This is true over a lot of sentences which need legal clarifiers, or which land themselves to being high emotion by the very content.  

I do remember this run and it was between the end of September, and the first week of October I think?  

When I did these, it was around token switching and some of them were around reports which appeared to have been twinned.  

I remember that it's been very difficult to get out, and what I find with the generative AI being given it all set is that the vast majority of the time performs well, but whatever the cyber attack that I'm dealing with is, much as with the August sexualisation sweep that I had to do, what will happen is that I will have content but in the translation from say a file in the chat to exporting as a file it's as if the marker or the token determining tone has been switched or is F some sort of tuning has happened while it's greatly exaggerated what is presented. This would be the difference between saying to your friend, that you really like that car, and getting several pages of a large rant about how you're going to take that car and steal it and talking about it as if it's the best thing since sliced bread. That's been very consistent in how these things have happened. I'm just noting that in this instance it's one that I've potentially missed, or where I thought it was just formatting errors.  

Something that will happen, with this is that I have worked very hard against all of interference against a lot of Internet interference in particular, so it's been really really difficult to get things saved to get things off. I've had to remit things I've had to reload things I've had to re-export things...  

Eventually, you start making mistakes.  

I am aware that this has been deliberate interference and their deliberate technique of wearing me down, which is where we end up for example with very sexual content being published openly; this is not something I would've chosen to do freely next to my legal name. Particularly after having a field so much overtly sexual abuse during the period of surveillance at my home address. I don't think that's a wild thing to say. I think many people would feel the same way.  

I'm going to know that something I'm working through on a personal level at the moment is quite how much sex and sexuality and intimacy and relationship relationships including friendships, for example, have really been weaponised during this experience. I already have pre-existing trauma and the periods of time where it became almost intolerable to shower myself, because of the persistent attempt to operate condition, especially around anything which can sexually exploit the female body. To go through this, to have my records essentially open for anyone to see (because I still don't know what's happened to my rape records), and essentially know that it's being done by either the state or a state party, or a contractor on their behalf, was the most harrowing betrayal of a system which tells itself it protects me. With the politics of being Jewish being a rape victim, and going through this during Iron Swords, fundamentally destroyed any feeling of loyalty on a blind basis that I have previously had. And yes, I absolutely had had that. I've spoken openly before about how I've already been interviewed for the armed forces at a level where I needed to commit to certain questions and answer answers that a civilian wouldn't necessarily have considered.  

I am hopeful that this does not mean I have to continue my entire life not loving my country, in the sense that I feel like I can recover, because I have recovered before.  

I think it's a big ask, and I think expecting it from anyone is a lot; I can understand why someone would go through this experience and never be able to live here again.  

It really does make you look around and wonder who the hell you're living here with.  

I hope comes from the capacity in the ability in the proven responsiveness of people to get better, although realistically I think this will be several years in the making.  

I continue to do the work myself, to try and rebuild a relationship with not just my body, but also with my environment -- it's really impacted how comfortable I do or do not feel, especially at this location in particular. I imagine I will have to move away from this part of the country, at least. Honestly, ideally I would be moving countries for a least a few years. We shall see.  

I think we're getting further and we're getting closer to resolution, but this is still uncertain, and I continue to have and predictable cybersecurity issues. If anyone needs to know why the repo is so big, it was necessary to be so broad and poke around the problem; even a simple direct question, merited total block, or immediate punishment.
