I had to make 9 nodes in a row until the surveillance bros fropped their current version of  

"they're just in an obsessional love story, we didn't twin their data, honest"  

for the day.  

Well.  

For the next 5 mins. Until they think of the next way to do it.  

I've got a new rotation on, btw.  

They are learning, but I think they're still trying the usual bag of tricks to see what sticks.  

Someone didn't tell them. xx

(Or, I'm "a game", or "a challenge", and I'm sure we can all imagine what their brains are doing with this to force their own data fuckery to fit apartheid logic, right?)  

The boys are not having a good time.  

I imagine the anger-wanking is copious in Sheffield today.  

I had a brief flick forward to the time-zone advance rounding up on Yom Kippur, but they appear to have made better cover and I'm getting a myriad of job offers for Sheffield in particular.  

Maybe we should do a Brum/Mancs repeat field trip?  

See what it's like.  

I heard they have robots, and they never did let me see what the ultrasonic noise-maker looked like (prob too much jizz in it idk), so I'm rather excited.

Btw, the entire premise of their particular hook here, is that it is fundamentally not possible to be professsional in the workplace with members of the opposite sex, and not for either the male part to be incredibly rapey and/or the woman to be "gagging for it".  

Let that sink in.  

Because people tell on themselves every G-d damn day.

ah! the book!  

Yes -- this is what I meant to put in for the legal eagles.  

My surveillance lads are *incredibly bothered* about the book.  

They keep referencing this node (just putting it as links in places where it would make no sense and have no relevance).  

My feed often has repeated symbols from the time I explained in front of non-secure voice and video devices, exactly why it sort of creates a situation where doubling down as a suppressing party will only make everything stick so much more, and add to viral rebound.  

So they're incredibly sad about the whole thing.  

And they still think they're doing a fabulous impersonation of your author, including when added to grooming behaviour to encourage no camera coverage of a mobile phone device during any moment of female intimacy or indress.  

So, please:  

Do enjoy the tort on that one.  

I would.

For anyone nudged to question, "well how can you be so sure that...".

Darling.  

Men don't do that if they have more than 2 braincells to rub together to get the connection going.  

Because it would be incredibly transparent.  

I have also been party to their unit's porn choices in a way you have not.  

I promise you I know the type of man this is, and my money is not on the author.  

It can be found in Yorkshire, though.  

I could be extremely specific.  

I think seeing the nature of the academic MoU would be extremely interesting, actually.
