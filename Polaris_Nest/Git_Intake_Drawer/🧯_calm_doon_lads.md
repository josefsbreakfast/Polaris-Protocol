I had to make 9 nodes in a row until the surveillance bros fropped their current version of  

"they're just in an obsessional love story, we didn't twin their data, honest"  

for the day.  

Well.  

For the next 5 mins. Until they think of the next way to do it.  

I've got a new rotation on, btw.  

They are learning, but I think they're still trying the usual bag of tricks to see what sticks.  

Someone didn't tell them. xx

(Or, I'm "a game", or "a challenge", and I'm sure we can all imagine what their brains are doing with this to force their own data fuckery to fit apartheid logic, right?)  

The boys are not having a good time.  

I imagine the anger-wanking is copious in Sheffield today.  

I had a brief flick forward to the time-zone advance rounding up on Yom Kippur, but they appear to have made better cover and I'm getting a myriad of job offers for Sheffield in particular.  

Maybe we should do a Brum/Mancs repeat field trip?  

See what it's like.  

I heard they have robots, and they never did let me see what the ultrasonic noise-maker looked like (prob too much jizz in it idk), so I'm rather excited.
