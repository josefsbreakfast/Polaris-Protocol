# 🏚️ Pre-Digital Design Flaws in Post-Digital Systems
**First created:** 2025-11-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*How legacy, paper-era institutional design breaks when exposed to modern digital information flow.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
UK public-sector systems were designed in a world of:
- paper files  
- localised information  
- slow communication  
- siloed responsibilities  

They were never designed for digital flow.

This node explains why pre-digital design produces post-digital harm.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Identifies structural flaws  
- Explains how digital flow overwhelms analogue-era systems  
- Connects design flaws to drift, silence, and misclassification

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Legacy Architecture Cannot Handle Digital Reality  
Pre-digital systems assume:
- information moves slowly  
- context stays local  
- errors remain contained  
- departments work independently  

None of this is true now.

---

### 2. Design Flaw Examples  
- silo-bound databases  
- incompatible software  
- no unified audit trails  
- replicated risk markers  
- outdated permissions  
- paper-era governance logic  

These flaws create the perfect conditions for drift.

---

### 3. Why Digital Overwhelms Analogue Logic  
Digital information:
- replicates  
- updates instantly  
- crosses boundaries  
- persists publicly  
- amplifies small errors  

Analogue systems cannot “see” these flows.

---

### 4. Consequences  
- misclassification  
- bureaucratic paralysis  
- multi-agency harm  
- recursive errors  
- opaque accountability  
- survivors becoming system-navigators
