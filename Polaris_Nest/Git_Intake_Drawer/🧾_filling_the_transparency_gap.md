# 🧾 Filling the Transparency Gap — Methodological Companion Node  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*Companion to the UoN–Israel Security Ecosystem Gap Map. Lists the kinds of data, records, and evidence that would exist in a transparent research‑security ecosystem, and how to locate them ethically through open sources.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node translates the “hole in the middle” from the **UoN–Israel Security Ecosystem — Open‑Source Gap Map** into a set of practical evidence categories.  
It shows what documents, datasets, and oversight materials *should* exist if a university’s defence, Israel, or security partnerships were fully transparent, and how each could be surfaced via lawful OSINT and archival work.

## 🧩 1. Contractual & Financial Transparency Layer  

| Missing or Obscured Item | What It Would Show | How It Normally Appears |
|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Defence & security contract lists** | Named partners (e.g., BAE, Rolls‑Royce, Elbit), project titles, contract values, durations | Annual procurement reports, FOI disclosures, Companies House filings |
| **Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)** | Formal R&D or data‑sharing agreements with defence or Israeli institutions | Partnership announcements, Senate or Council minutes |
| **Tender / bid documentation** | Which labs bid for UKRI, Innovate UK, or Home Office security grants | Contracts Finder, ResearchFish, Gateway to Research |
| **Commercialisation agreements (NTV / incubator)** | Spin‑outs licensing or selling IP relevant to surveillance or defence | Nottingham Technology Ventures annual reports |
| **Charitable donations & endowments** | Donor origins and purpose of funds | University financial statements and gift registers |

**Gap meaning:** absence of these records prevents tracing the money and decision‑making that link humanitarian branding with military funding streams.

## 🧪 2. Research & Data‑Governance Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Ethics‑committee summaries** | Which projects underwent review for dual‑use or security risks | REC archives, project webpages |
| **Data‑sharing agreements (DSAs)** | Ownership and access rights for remote‑sensing or behavioural datasets | Attached to deliverables or data repositories |
| **Security‑classification notices** | Whether outputs are export‑controlled or restricted | Research contracts, export‑control disclosures |
| **Publication embargo notes** | Reasons for delay or partial release | Journal metadata or repository records |
| **Data‑protection impact assessments (DPIAs)** | Risk assessments for sensitive‑population data | GDPR compliance records |

**Gap meaning:** opacity here implies data streams may be operating under commercial or classified protection rather than open academic scrutiny.

---

## 🧠 3. Governance & Oversight Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Minutes of Partnerships / Ethics Boards** | Who approved high‑risk collaborations | Council or Senate minutes |
| **Conflict‑of‑interest registers** | Equity or advisory roles in spin‑outs | Annual declarations, charity filings |
| **Prevent / Security liaison papers** | Institutional alignment with national‑security policies | FOI responses, internal governance frameworks |
| **Community‑engagement frameworks** | How protest or dissent is formally addressed | Equality & Human Rights Impact Assessments, policy docs |

**Gap meaning:** absence of governance documentation means oversight may be internalised and shielded from stakeholder accountability.

---

## 🌍 4. International & Policy Interface Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Foreign‑research collaboration statements** | Bilateral research with Israeli institutions beyond BIRAX | UKRI / BEIS databases |
| **Export‑licence declarations** | Hardware or software subject to export control | UK Export Control Joint Unit public filings |
| **FCDO / Home Office grant data** | Government security or CVE funding flows | ODA or National Security Science and Technology records |
| **NGO / inter‑agency audits** | Third‑party verification of humanitarian vs. security usage | NGO or UN audit reports |

**Gap meaning:** a blank policy interface hides how civilian research feeds national‑security objectives.

---

## 📊 5. Civic & Social Accountability Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Community‑impact statements** | Local or diasporic effects of security partnerships | Council or university community reports |
| **Complaint / whistleblower statistics** | Handling of dissent or harm | Governance statements |
| **Equality Impact Assessments** | Evaluation of bias or discrimination risks | EDI office documentation |
| **Student‑disciplinary transparency** | Protest‑related disciplinary data | Senate or Council annual reports |

**Gap meaning:** without this layer, the local democratic feedback loop is invisible.

## 🔍 6. Methods to Begin Filling the Gap (Open & Ethical)  

1. **FOI / EIR** — Request aggregated defence‑funding data, partnership lists, DPIAs, and redacted committee minutes.  
2. **UKRI Gateway to Research mining** — Filter by security, dual‑use, counter‑terrorism, or Israel tags; export results to CSV.  
3. **Companies House & incubator filings** — Identify spin‑outs, shareholders, and PSC overlaps.  
4. **Export‑control database search** — Cross‑check university entities against ECJU public licence lists.  
5. **Minutes & board papers via FOI** — Test whether ethics boards discussed security collaborations.  
6. **Community‑impact mapping** — Match contract or grant dates with protest crackdowns and media coverage.  

Each task can be performed entirely within open‑source and legal bounds.

*Filling the Transparency Gap — Methodological Companion Node* expands on the open‑source gap‑map methodology.  
It outlines the documentary strata that a transparent institution would make visible, and provides lawful ways to surface missing evidence using only public records.
