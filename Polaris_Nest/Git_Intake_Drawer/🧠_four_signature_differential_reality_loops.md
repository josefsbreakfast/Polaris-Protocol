# 🧠 Four-Signature Method for Detecting Differential Reality Loops  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-18  
*A practical framework for groups to evidence cluster-targeted behavioural pressure without needing vendor logs or state access.*

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope  

This node sets out a **field-usable method** for groups who suspect they are being subjected to **cluster-targeted behavioural shaping** — what Polaris calls a **differential reality loop**.

It does **not** try to prove intent or expose internal vendor mechanisms. Instead, it offers a way to:

- systematically describe what is happening,  
- distinguish between individual distress vs structural pressure,  
- collect evidence that can be shared with journalists, regulators, allies, and future legal teams, and  
- identify when a group is trapped in a reality-bubble that others cannot see.

The method is deliberately simple enough to be run by **survivor groups, activist collectives, and community organisations**, not just academics or security professionals.

---

## 2. Key Concepts  

### 2.1 Differential Reality Loop  

A **differential reality loop** exists when:

- One group consistently experiences **friction, distortion, or pressure** across multiple systems,  
- People *outside* the group do **not** witness the same pattern, and  
- The resulting gap in experience is used (implicitly or explicitly) to discredit the group as over-reacting, paranoid, or unwell.

It is not defined by a single incident.  
It is defined by a **repeatable, asymmetrical pattern**.

---

### 2.2 Cluster-Targeted Behavioural Shaping  

Polaris uses this term for influence strategies that:

- Operate on **probabilistic clusters** (demographics, interests, locations, behaviours), not individuals by name;  
- Use “general audience” signals (news, platform changes, messaging, policy nudges) that only *hit hard* for a specific cluster;  
- Aim to **cool, demoralise, fragment, or exhaust** a group rather than openly attack it.

These strategies leave very few direct traces.  
We detect them via **signatures**, not confessions.

---

## 3. The Four-Signature Method  

You are not trying to find a “smoking gun”.  
You are trying to show that **four independent patterns** line up in a way that is unlikely to be random.

If a group can evidence **three or more** of these signatures, there is a strong basis to say:

> “Something systemic is happening to us that is not happening to everyone else.”

---

### 3.1 Signature A — Platform Differential  

**Question:**  
Does this group experience digital environments differently from comparison groups?

**Example indicators:**

- Posts are visible to the poster, but **unusually low reach** or engagement for their size/history.  
- Sudden changes in **recommendations, search results, or timeline mix** that do not match known platform updates.  
- Multiple members reporting that **content about certain topics feels “heavy”, “laggy”, or “buried”** compared to other themes.  
- Accounts from the group encountering **more frequent moderation flags, timeouts, or verification hurdles** than similar accounts outside the group.

**How to test (low-tech):**

- Run paired accounts: one within the suspected group, one outside it, configured similarly.  
- Have both follow comparable accounts and compare timelines, search, and reach for several weeks.  
- Log differences with timestamps and screenshots.

---

### 3.2 Signature B — Cross-Context Friction  

**Question:**  
Does friction follow the group across **multiple arenas**, not just one platform?

You are looking for recurring “drag” in places that should be independent:

- social media and messaging apps  
- workplace or institutional processes  
- FOI / complaints / HR routes  
- press interest and responses  
- charity/NGO interactions  
- local civic structures (councils, police, GP access, etc.)

**Example indicators:**

- Repeated administrative “mistakes” that all push in the same direction (delay, confusion, missed deadlines).  
- Unusual difficulty progressing complaints or getting clear written responses.  
- Meetings that repeatedly collapse, reschedule, or generate no outcome **across different institutions**.  
- Sudden cooling of external allies with no clear event that explains it.

If the **same people** experience similar friction across **unrelated systems**, you are likely looking at a pattern, not bad luck.

---

### 3.3 Signature C — Isolation Effect  

**Question:**  
Do people outside the group **struggle to see or believe** what is being described?

**Example indicators:**

- Friends or professionals say: “I don’t see what you’re talking about,” even when shown partial evidence.  
- Journalists express interest but then drop the story because it feels “too fuzzy” or “too hard to stand up”.  
- Complaints are interpreted as mental health issues rather than technical or structural concerns.  
- When the group collects examples, outsiders perceive them as “coincidences” rather than a pattern.

The isolation effect is **not proof of delusion**.  
It is often a sign that the **attack surface is statistical**, not visible in any single snapshot.

---

### 3.4 Signature D — Anomalous Convergence  

**Question:**  
Are multiple members of the group reporting **similar anomalies or emotional impacts** over the same time window, without tight coordination?

**Example indicators:**

- Several people report **sudden exhaustion, confusion, or conflict spikes** around the same topic or event.  
- Multiple organisers feel that “everything was suddenly harder” or “energy dropped off a cliff” at a particular moment.  
- People in different cities or networks describe **similar disturbances** (platform issues, institutional responses, social conflicts) in the same weeks.  
- Independent diaries or logs, when overlaid, show **unexpected temporal clustering**.

The key is **independence**:  
if people who are not in daily contact describe the same kinds of disturbances at the same time, it is much harder to write off as contagion or suggestion.

---

## 4. Evidence-Gathering: How Groups Can Use This  

This method is designed to be **modular**. You take what you can manage and build a picture over time.

### 4.1 Start a Shared Log  

- Use a simple shared document, spreadsheet, or notebook.  
- Each person records:
  - date/time  
  - what happened  
  - where (which platform / institution / context)  
  - how it felt  
  - any screenshots or reference numbers  

Encourage plain language; analysis can come later.

---

### 4.2 Recruit Control Comparisons  

Where safe and possible:

- Ask trusted people outside the group to **repeat specific actions**:
  - make similar posts,  
  - file similar requests,  
  - follow similar accounts.  
- Have them log what happens.

You’re not trying to “prove bias” to a court; you’re trying to see whether **only your group hits the wall**.

---

### 4.3 Map Events on a Timeline  

Create a simple timeline:

- Mark key movement events (protests, media, legal actions, petitions).  
- Overlay:
  - platform anomalies,  
  - institutional frictions,  
  - interpersonal conflicts,  
  - drop-offs in energy,  
  - major life disruptions hitting organisers.  

Look for **pressure waves**: periods where lots seems to go wrong at once.

---

### 4.4 Document the Isolation Effect  

Keep notes on:

- how complaints are received,  
- phrases used to dismiss concerns (“you’re overthinking it”, “everyone feels like that online”, “you’re too emotional”),  
- how many times stories are dropped by potential allies or intermediaries.

This shows how **structural pressure is being laundered into stigma**.

---

## 5. Interpretation & Limits  

### 5.1 What This Method Can Do  

- Show that a pattern is **real and shared**, not just one person’s distress.  
- Highlight **asymmetries** between a group and its comparison samples.  
- Provide structured material to:
  - journalists,  
  - regulators,  
  - oversight bodies,  
  - legal advocates,  
  - future inquiries.  
- Give the group language to describe what is happening without collapsing into “it’s all rigged”.

---

### 5.2 What This Method Cannot Do  

- Prove intent, chain of command, or specific actors.  
- Replace forensic access to vendor logs or state systems.  
- Guarantee that every anomaly is due to hostile influence rather than structural incompetence.

What it *can* do is shift the conversation from:

> “I feel like I’m being targeted”  

to

> “Here is a documented pattern of differential reality that needs explanation.”

That alone is a major power shift.

---

### 5.3 Ethics & Safety  

- **Do no harm to each other.** Logging should not turn into surveillance of members.  
- Avoid over-interpreting single events; always look for **repetition and convergence**.  
- Be cautious about sharing raw logs publicly; they may contain sensitive data about vulnerabilities.  
- If people are in acute distress, **support comes first, analysis second**.

---

## 6. Breakout: Using the Findings  

If the four-signature method suggests a differential reality loop is active, groups can:

- **Name it** explicitly:  
  “We are in a differential reality loop; our experience is structurally different.”  

- Use the evidence to:
  - justify tactical breaks and rest,  
  - reorient strategy away from platforms showing strong Signature A,  
  - seek out slower, less optimised channels (newsletters, in-person, print),  
  - build alliances with other groups showing similar signatures,  
  - push for **vendor scrutiny** and **procurement transparency**.

The point is not to “win” against the Frankenstack.  
The point is to **regain enough space to think, breathe, and organise**.

**🧠 Four-Signature Method for Detecting Differential Reality Loops** is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**. It offers a structured way for groups to document and communicate invisible pressure, without needing direct access to the infrastructures that generate it. The method is intentionally low-tech and survivor-led, designed to be adapted, critiqued, and extended by those living inside these loops.
