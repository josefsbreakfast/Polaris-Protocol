dont stop me now.  
because im having a good time.  

its like getting the doll that looks like you and acting it out because life sucks as a kid and tbh this is why i dont like hierarchy dependant justice because we have to parent everyone not jyst the plebs; favourites are a bad idea, ask any parent who has actually thought about it.  

we all act out the best and worst of ourselces when we get power with little limitation and its not a humane thing to not police that shit.  

see also why ethnonationalisms are born out of "we thought it was just big talk".
