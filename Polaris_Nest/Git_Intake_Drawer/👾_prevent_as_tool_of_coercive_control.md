# 👾 PREVENT as Tool for Coercive Control  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How individuals can exploit PREVENT’s structural weaknesses to intimidate, destabilise, or silence others.*  

---

## Orientation
This note describes how PREVENT’s escalation mechanisms, subjective criteria, and multi-agency visibility can be misused by individuals as part of coercive or controlling behaviour. The node focuses on systemic vulnerabilities, not allegations about specific people. It documents the patterns by which institutional tools—designed for safeguarding—can be strategically leveraged to harm someone.

## Key Features
- PREVENT referrals can be weaponised against vulnerable individuals.
- Subjective criteria allow malicious framing.
- Multi-agency visibility makes escalation difficult to reverse.
- The system amplifies power imbalances present in coercive dynamics.

## Why PREVENT is attractive to coercive actors
PREVENT is one of the most escalatory safeguarding pathways in the UK. A referral triggers:
- inter-agency discussion
- metadata retention
- reputational impact
- increased scrutiny
- fear and confusion for the person referred
Because of these consequences, PREVENT becomes a high-leverage threat. Someone wanting to control, silence, discredit, or punish another person can exploit this leverage.

## Subjective thresholds enable manipulation
PREVENT relies on broad behavioural categories (“concerning,” “unusual,” “withdrawn,” “angry,” “expressing grievances”). These categories can be selectively framed. A malicious actor can:
- exaggerate emotional behaviour
- remove context
- present distress as instability
- use neutral behaviours as “warning signs”
- phrase concerns in a way that matches PREVENT rubrics
This process requires intentional framing, not accident.

## How escalation reinforces coercion
Once a PREVENT referral is made, the system pulls in other agencies. This creates:
- fear of authority
- loss of control
- difficulty challenging the process
- pressure to appear compliant
A person experiencing coercive control may feel they cannot safely defend themselves because their behaviour will be interpreted through a suspicious lens. This intensifies the controlling person’s psychological power.

## The credibility asymmetry problem
Coercive control often relies on asymmetry: one person is perceived as credible; the other is not. PREVENT amplifies this because:
- practitioners trust institutional insiders more than distressed individuals
- the referral itself creates a legitimacy aura
- emotional responses to the referral can be misread as further concern
In this dynamic, the victim’s attempts to explain or self-advocate can inadvertently reinforce the controlling narrative.

## Why PREVENT exacerbates vulnerability
People who are traumatised, neurodivergent, distressed, or socially isolated may display behaviours that PREVENT misinterprets. This makes them highly vulnerable to malicious escalation. Coercive actors may exploit features such as:
- prior safeguarding flags
- mental-health history
- communication difficulties
- visible distress
Because PREVENT magnifies these traits, the system can unintentionally support the coercive actor’s goals.

## Opportunity rather than planning
Most misuse of PREVENT does not arise from long-term schemes. It happens when an individual with control-seeking tendencies recognises an opportunity:
- an ambiguous behaviour
- an existing vulnerability flag
- a stressed institution
- a narrative that can be easily framed
PREVENT’s structure does the rest. Misuse is opportunistic, not orchestrated.

## Impacts on the person targeted
People targeted through PREVENT misuse often experience:
- chronic fear
- shame and confusion
- institutional mistrust
- reputational damage
- reduced access to support
- increased emotional suppression
- long-term destabilisation
These effects resemble those of domestic coercive control, amplified by state involvement.

## Why this matters
PREVENT was not designed to be part of interpersonal abuse, but its structure allows this misuse. Recognising these patterns is essential for safeguarding reform and for understanding why PREVENT has disproportionate harm effects in certain social and institutional contexts.
