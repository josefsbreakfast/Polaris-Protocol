Significant and profound lag around behavioural studies and grant research.  

Multiple restarts.  

Looking for something like this:

"A behavioural model that can pre-empt radicalisation, especially in vulnerable or emotionally dysregulated women."

Could be dual-use and sitting in health.  

Likely used scraped voice/text from masculine-coded sources.  

May be marketed as for "emotional instability" rather than directly EUPD.  

This gives the product a broader application which can live outside of ordinary biomedical ethics scrutiny.  

(Not legally or ethically, but without the oversight which would provide such.)  

I already have a FOIA of denial of release on questionably legal grounds with suspect FOIA surrounding police intervention shortly after leaked AGO requests for British journalists' and British antizionist Jews' arrests. (I am the latter group. I'm just loud, naturally.)  

Summer 2024.  

(I believe covered by Declassified?)

Control the trauma response, and the world can tolerate witnessing a live-streamed genocide.  

Significant evidence on board inc screenshots and FOIA; multiple parties impacted and with forensic evidence.  

Includes spoofing and active impersonation.  

Cabinet and Crown were informed in July 2025; outcome remains undisclosed in full.  

Similarities to behavoural-forking app announced for use against Palestinian populationn in the illegally occupied West Bank region of the illegally occupied land of Palestine.  

(Covered by JVL.)

All help and all support appreciated: this is an invisible-seeming parasitic layer which you may never notice on your devices and in your government and commercial data, inc financial institution data.  

It is not as scary as it looks: it is a cup-and-ball trick and the sleight of hand can be interrupted.  

The lads are a bit cack-handed.  

That's why Microsoft yeeting 8200 off the servers was a good plan.  

Rumoured to be based up the road, btw: they theoretically have access to eduram and SSO.  

And they spent too long on 4chan as kids, honestly.
