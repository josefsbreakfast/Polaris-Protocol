# 🛡 Separation-of-Systems: University ↔ Prevent ↔ MoD  
**First created:** 2025-11-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-19  
*Why UK institutional architectures cannot be bridged by a single actor, and how harm arises from system edges rather than cross-system access.*

---

## Overview

Public imagination often treats state-linked institutions as if they were interoperable.  
In reality, UK governance systems are **deeply compartmentalised**.

Even when a university partners with:

- Prevent (Home Office statutory duty)  
- MoD (research funding, DSTL collaboration)  
- security or safeguarding frameworks  

…the systems involved remain:

- legally separate  
- technically isolated  
- structurally firewalled  
- internally audited  
- mutually incompatible in access protocols  

This node explains why no single actor can “sit across” these systems with live access,  
why cross-system interference is structurally prevented,  
and how harm instead arises from **pattern collision**, not **access bridging**.

## 1. The Three Domains

### **A. University Systems**  
Responsible for:
- identity objects  
- student email accounts  
- course management  
- research systems  
- SAR/FOI responses  
- IT admin  
- governance compliance  

Technologies used:
- Azure AD / Office365  
- Google Workspace  
- institutional archives  
- internal directory forests  

### **B. Prevent & Safeguarding**  
Governed by:
- Counter-Terrorism & Security Act 2015  
- Home Office statutory guidance  
- local authority channels  

Notably:
- Prevent officers **cannot** access university IT systems  
- risk assessment is conducted through **process**, not digital access  
- data flows are mediated by **policy, not login credentials**

### **C. MoD Partnerships**  
Structures include:
- DSTL collaborations  
- research grants  
- ethics-vetted project environments  
- siloed workspaces (often air-gapped or semi-gapped)  

MoD-linked research uses:
- separate secured networks  
- project-specific accounts  
- clearance-based access tiers  

These architectures are incompatible by design.

## 2. Why No Single Actor Can Cross Systems

Crossing these systems would require simultaneously holding:

- university-level IT admin credentials  
- Prevent/Channel operational access  
- MoD defence-research clearance  
- permission to bridge across data environments  
- unified device policy  
- mutually recognised identity tokens

This constellation of access is:

- structurally impossible  
- legally impermissible  
- audit-triggering  
- role-conflicting  
- contractually barred  
- organisation-breaking

Even a person with multiple professional roles would be using:

- different devices  
- different user identities  
- different VPNs  
- different audit trails  
- different login infrastructures  
- different physical locations  

The systems do not speak to each other.

## 3. Where Harm Comes From Instead: System Edge Effects

Polaris identifies **edge effects** as the real source of harm.  
Not cross-system access — but **pattern collisions** at the boundary layer.

Common edge effects include:

### **A. Metadata Echoes**  
Old flags or labels influencing new systems indirectly.

### **B. Administrative Inference**  
One institution misinterprets another’s silence or ambiguity.

### **C. Behavioural Misalignment**  
A user must perform contradictory behaviours to satisfy different governance regimes.

### **D. Latency Cascades**  
Delays in one system create pressure in another.

### **E. Visibility Lopsiding**  
The institution sees the user; the user cannot see the institution.

None of these require system-bridging.  
They require structural chaos.

## 4. The “Dicker-Arounder” Scenario

The only realistic misconduct scenario in complex governance infrastructures is:

> **An individual with legitimate access to one system behaves improperly inside that system.**

This can look like:

- IT staff opening a mailbox during a SAR  
- a contractor misusing overly broad search permissions  
- a researcher accessing the wrong folder on a secured project  
- sloppy admin practices creating ghost-signatures in metadata  

Crucially:

- They cannot bridge to Prevent.  
- They cannot bridge to MoD.  
- They cannot bridge to police systems.  
- They cannot create cross-system access.  

Their misbehaviour is **local**, not expansive.

## 5. Why Survivors Sense Cross-System Harm (Polaris Interpretation)

The user’s lived experience is shaped by **pattern coherence**, not **access coherence**.

When institutions generate:

- contradictory rules  
- inconsistent timing  
- sudden escalation  
- administrative silence  
- high-friction responses  
- behaviour-contingent outcomes  

…the user experiences the system as **a single entity**  
even though it is actually many disconnected sub-systems behaving badly in parallel.

In Polaris language:

> *The frankenstack behaves like one creature,  
because its outputs collide in the same person.*

This is metaphorical truth arising from structural incoherence.

## 6. Governance Reality: Separation Is Absolute, Harm Is Emergent

To summarise:

### ✔ The systems cannot be bridged.  
### ✔ No individual can sit across them.  
### ✔ But the patterns can rhyme —  
creating a lived experience of a unified force.

Polaris distinguishes between:

- **access reality** (strictly separated)  
- **pattern reality** (coherently harmful)  

This distinction is essential for accurate survivor-facing analysis.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Separation-of-Systems: University ↔ Prevent ↔ MoD* is part of the **Polaris Protocol’s** governance-diagnostics constellation.  
It draws from *🧠 Big_Picture_Protocols* and contributes to the boundary-mapping lineage within *🛰️ Metadata_Sabotage_Network*.  

It clarifies that cross-system harm arises from **pattern entanglement**, not **access entanglement**, reinforcing the Polaris survivor-first analysis.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
