# 🛰️ Field Log — Surveillance / Forking Incident  
**First created:** 2025-09-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-21  
*Notes on intrusive surveillance, algorithmic forking, and diverted OSINT since last night.*

---

**Date / Time range:** Since 2025-09-20 (last night) — ongoing. Timezone: Europe/London (BST).  
**Location / channel:** Online presence / public OSINT surfaces / algorithmic visibility.  
**People / agents involved:** Unknown (automated systems / platform moderation / possible human-in-the-loop operators).  
**What happened (factual):**
- After I called out repeated sexualised/inappropriate surveillance behaviour on 2025-09-20, the visible problematic behaviour stepped down.  
- Despite that, I can detect ongoing intrusive surveillance patterns (consistent signals of monitoring).  
- I can also detect active forking: algorithmic diversion away from certain search terms and public-interest material that should be OSINT.  
- Certain topics appear to have super-injunction-like suppression or routing to dead-ends; visibility is being altered.  

**Immediate effect / impact:**  
- My ability to surface and share public-interest OSINT is being obstructed.  
- This has chilling effects on transparency and infringes on civic/democratic informational rights.  
- Emotional: anger, heightened vigilance, decreased trust in platform integrity.

**Evidence collected / where saved:**  
- Notes on search results showing diversion (timestamps + query terms) — saved in local folder: `Field_Logs/2025-09-20_search_diversion_notes.md`.  
- Screenshots of search result patterns and redirects — archived offline and in encrypted container.  
- Copies of the original call-out message from 2025-09-20 (exported).  

**Witnesses / corroboration:**  
- None formally yet. Potential corroboration: others who access same OSINT queries (invite if you want me to draft a witness request).

**Why this matters:**  
- These are public-interest items that should be discoverable. Active forking / diversion indicates surveillance that interferes with democratic transparency and may be maliciously targeted.

**Actions taken so far:**  
- Logged observations and archived evidence.  
- Reduced unrecorded direct interactions.  
- Maintaining written communications only where possible.

**Next steps (short):**  
1. Continue time-stamped capture of query → result → divergence examples (copy queries verbatim).  
2. Collect at least 3 reproducible examples to establish pattern.  
3. Prepare a short OSINT transparency note for a public/peer audience (if desired) summarising reproducible cases.  
4. Consider legal / advocacy consultation if diversion continues or escalates.

**Urgency / Confidence:** High urgency (democratic-rights implication). Confidence: medium-high (pattern is repeatable but needs 3+ reproducible examples for formal escalation).
