# 🕹️ Getting the Tech Bros Back on Script  
**Folder:** 👾 Debugging The Men → 🧬 Further Potential Male Nonsense  
**Created:** 2025-11-16 | **Updated:** 2025-11-16  
*A coordination protocol for redirecting extremely wealthy, extremely online men back toward reality, professionalism, and the shared nerd mission, before they embarrass us on main again.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
We are not trying to silence innovation.  
We are trying to stop:

- pseudo-neuroscience in public,  
- NPC discourse from billionaires,  
- ontological LARPing in policy spaces,  
- fragile masculinity spirals packaged as science,  
- and the kind of rich-men monologuing that makes the public turn anti-science, anti-tech, and anti-nerd.

This node exists because:

> **We need the bafflingly rich, unpractically grounded subset of tech bros  
> to stop freestyling lore into microphones  
> and start adhering to the basic norms of interdisciplinary civilisation.**

In other words:  
**get back on script.**

## 🎮 1. What “The Script” Actually Is  
Not a script in the PR sense.  
A script in the “this is what professional adults do in public” sense.

### The Script =  
- check the field you’re talking about  
- speak proportionately  
- acknowledge uncertainty  
- don’t claim expertise you don't have  
- listen more than you pontificate  
- don’t dehumanise your user base  
- don’t talk about the world like it’s a video game  
- don’t invent a personal metaphysics on-air  
- don’t conflate thought experiments with policy  

The Script is not punitive.  
It is **reality hygiene**.

---

## 🎧 2. Why We Need This Protocol  
Because right now:

- One billionaire says nonsense → public trust collapses  
- One tech bro oversteps → vaccines become optional  
- One “simulation theory” rant → populists gain votes  
- One misuse of the word “quantum” → conspiracy ecosystems feast  
- One man refuses pronouns → “culture war” becomes policy  
- One “NPC” reference → women & ND people get targeted  
- One fumbled explanation of consciousness → philosophers scream in 12 languages  

The public treats all nerds as a monolith.  
If one goes rogue, **we all pay.**

We need consistency for survival.

## 🧭 3. The Core Components of Getting Back on Script

### 3.1 **Stay in canon**  
There *is* canon:

- scientific canon  
- philosophical canon  
- historical canon  
- feminist canon  
- social science canon  
- survivor testimony  
- lived-experience frameworks  

If your hot take contradicts the established canon of an entire field,  
it is not revolutionary.  
It is **fanfic**.

Fanfic is fine.  
Just don’t sell it as a new constitution.

---

### 3.2 **Consult your party before casting a spell**  
Before you go public with a big idea:

- ask a biologist  
- ask a neuroscientist  
- ask a feminist  
- ask a queer theorist  
- ask a philosopher  
- ask an ND person  
- ask someone who has actually done real governance work  
- and for love of god, ask one woman

A multidisciplinary check is not censorship.  
It is **QA for ideas**.

---

### 3.3 **Stop condescending to the audience**  
NPC is not a personality.  
“Normies” is not a worldview.  
“Most people don’t think deeply” is projection.

If the general public cannot understand your vision,  
the problem is not the public.  
It is **your communication and your grounding**.

---

### 3.4 **Drop the grandiose monologue energy**  
Less “I alone have solved it.”  
More:

> “This is one possible interpretation with many limitations.”

Grown men do not need to cosplay Prometheus on podcasts.

---

### 3.5 **Stop confusing vibes with disciplines**  
Examples of going off script:

- neuroscience invented fresh on the spot  
- misquoting quantum theory  
- calling trauma an optimisation error  
- confusing gender theory with personal discomfort  
- reinventing phrenology with machine learning  
- treating risk models as metaphysics  
- flattening social reality to a toy model  
- speaking with confidence about fields you’ve never read  

These are lore errors, not theories.

---

### 3.6 **Do not escalate culture wars out of boredom**  
Pronouns are not oppression.  
Feminism is not a threat to innovation.  
ND traits are not anomalies.  
"Normal people" are not NPCs.  
Survivors are not noise.  

If you are suffering intense discomfort from someone asking for basic respect,  
the correct action is:

> **go outside immediately.**

Touch something green.  
Hydrate.  
Reboot.

## 🎛️ 4. Practical Tools for Re-Scripting Tech Bros

### 🧩 A. The Interdisciplinary Buddy System  
Pair each high-risk tech bro with:

- a scientist  
- a humanities person  
- and someone who has emotionally matured past age 14

They check his statements before he goes live.

---

### 🧩 B. The “Does This Sound Unhinged?” Test  
Before posting:

Ask one person who is not a man in your income bracket  
if the sentence sounds normal.

If they blink rapidly or tilt their head,  
delete.

---

### 🧩 C. The Pronoun Calibration Device  
If a man cannot handle pronouns,  
he cannot handle:

- ethics  
- governance  
- cross-cultural negotiation  
- survivor testimony  
- long-term responsibility  
- policy nuance  
- or AI safety  

Reject leadership claims until calibration is complete.

---

### 🧩 D. The Reality Touchpoint Rule  
Every week, tech bros must:

- speak to someone who works a non-tech job  
- experience a public space  
- hear a woman explain a boundary  
- engage with data that contradicts their beliefs  
- listen to a field they don’t understand  

Grounding prevents lore drift.

## 🧬 5. Why This Matters (Polaris Analysis)  
When elite tech men spiral into:

- lore  
- pseudo-science  
- culture wars  
- alt-right flirtation  
- metaphysical monologuing  
- dominance language  

…it destabilises:

- public trust  
- democratic decision-making  
- science communication  
- survivor credibility  
- digital safety  
- ND safety  
- cross-domain cooperation  

And it strengthens:

- populism  
- misogynistic movements  
- disinformation  
- AI hype cults  
- stochastic harm pipelines  

Getting them back on script stabilises the entire ecosystem.
