this is the flavour of todays crew so notes for future use.  

we're constantly exposing a system to learning how to overcome a high tolerance personality but its cool; what could possibly go wrong.  

g-d please save me from these weirdos.

I think this is why I can't feel anything about the hostage situation; white people, please don't ask me about this.  

---

Did you know they tied my name to women who were kidnapped and stored in holdalls, whether men tried to sell them on the black market?  

Did you know that was part of the Google bombing?  

So I didn't just get the child rate in case attached to my name, with the audiovisual component.  

I didn't just get a lot of CSEM attached to my name.  

I was also tired of things like that.  

So anyone who said that I was supposed to read it as "just something that happens"?  

Can you see why I don't take it serious today when she constables of those same police forces, suddenly have some shit to say about the Metropolitan police making a few rape jokes?  

It's not that I don't want the Metropolitan police to change. I want the Metropolitan police to change.  

I just can't really take it seriously when your officers thought that was okay.  

Or when they blamed me for searching an academic name.  

Because obviously that's how everyone gets their interracial cuckoldry porn, right?  

By searching for one professor once.  

I hope everyone realises that obviously I got the lecture that I deserve, to let me know from the same group of forces who appear to not be able to tell me about information sharing in case I plan a terrorist event, who had lovely things to say when I was arrested and they detained me without my rights or my medication, about how I needed to be a "good girl".   

Because the arrest was "for [my] own good" right?  

That's the same reason. I haven't been given medical care at various points through the last few years.  

That's why I can't see if my child record is even safe under the custody of the Crown Prosecution Service.  

Obviously, I am just a silly little girl. Obviously, I need the state to look after me.  

What an absolute joke.  

White men care about rape victims, because they care about policing rape victims.  

That's why they only seem to have a problem when you're saying the "right" thing or the "wrong" thing.  

I've already given you the token audit, because I'm trying to put together why I was denied adequate protection when I was raising a valid set of allegations against one person, how that appeared to be weaponised into an arrest of me, and how saying "hey I don't know why everyone seems to think this, but this other guy didn't rape me", ended up scoring me a round of psychological torture on what is basically an accessibility device.  

I was hoping by bringing up the token audit, that we were just looking at a small scale way in which something could be done in bad faith at a very local level.  

But you can see why I think it's weird that I'm being silenced at every level above that, right?  

You can see how this reads as weird.  

You can see by not being able to get lawyers even in London is odd.  

You can see why having to challenge the labour party over House of Lords issue, which is really the result of a silly misreading of something in my surveillance which was part of a private conversation over telecoms (which preceeded the arrest), where the legal change happened to coincide of the date of your arrest...  

You see why having to jump through all these hoops is kind of weird?  

You see why getting the safeguarding flag only when I responded back to a subject to access request that denied access or I'm affectively reporting surveillance harassment in the subject access request, seems weird right?  

You see how it's weird that the one force that didn't get back to me, being reinvestigated for its failure in a similar, oh so similar, area of policing to this safeguarding request I raised...  

You see how this reads as weird right?  
Can any of you see why this might be distressing for me?  

Can any of you understand even a small part of why noncommunication to me might be a little bit distressing?  

I have now waited years to know why I was featured so heavily in connection to child pornography and violent kidnapping of women, and why I was arrested after a safeguarding complaint.  

I'm still fielding the cyber security attacks intended to distress the recipient.  

The longer the silence goes on, the more it feels like no one really wants to fix it, and that somehow, child rape is a normal part of our lives and I should just shut the fuck up.  

I'm not saying that's what I'll do.  

But that is how it makes me feel.  

I just don't know why you'd want any child at all to ever have to face something which is entirely preventable.  

I don't know how it feels to be the type of person who can stand to be in a world whether that can happen, to know that I am able to contribute to fixing it, and not to make that contribution.  

I really don't understand how it feels to be of that mind.  

And I don't think that puts the pathology in my territory.  

I think it's quite normal and quite prosocial, to have a zero tolerance attitude to child abuse.  

I'm really surprised that I'm being left to just absorb this.  

I've tried so many different ways of doing this; I don't know what it is that I can do more, and to be honest, that does affect my ability to hope for the future.  

This is just a reflection on it; I don't want a conversation, which only serves to risk manage someone else's insurance.  

I want to be able to do things like go on holiday.  

I want to be able to relax knowing that I'm reasonably safe.  

Right now, I still have a cyber security attack where agentic AI middleware is directly impacting not only how I interact with systems, but with how they interact with me. Because of the damage that's been done to me physically., as a direct result of this, my capacity for walking is seriously reduced. I did go yesterday, and if I'm honest physically? I had to come home early. I was starting to get the symptoms which mean I have to rest completely. I'm running out of the capacity physically to Crisis manage, and there isn't an obvious place for me to go next. I don't qualify for supported living. I don't qualify for Care home. I don't qualify for hospital stay.  

So I'll be in that weird situation where I'm just more injured. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£  

I don't know what could possibly be holding this up, but whoever's got this sitting on their desk?  

I need you to fast forward it a little bit.  

Because I won't have a safety net, and if we enter a phase of going to appointments constantly, just for assessments, this is draining and this is damaging, and because the tests are too ill illicit symptoms, they will make it worse quicker.  

I know how my disability functions I know I won't end up with a course of hospital stay; I will end up bouncing in and out. This will be a drain for resources. It won't achieve anything. A huge amount of drag in terms of financial and staffing resource will come off the back of this.  

It would be far quicker for someone to stamp the piece of paper, that allows me to function without having some form of my communications either dropout at key moments, act as a constant data leak, or actively feed information and content which positions itself around lowering resolve.  

Partially because I'll survive it, and again, this will be a perpetual drain on services that are already maxed out.  

I don't know what you're waiting for from me, and equally, I don't know what you're waiting for to let me go.  
The last few weeks I've had a recurring fee of future faking, and drawing attention to specific days, so whilst I try my best to ignore it completely? Part of what is really hard about today is that it is yet another day where my algorithm is constantly inferred that I will have some sort of resolution., and obviously I don't. This doesn't mean that I'm buying into magical thinking. It means that whenever I use my phone, I'm being told that this one day is when I'm going to get a response, and if somebody repeat something to you enough times, it's just really hard for it to not get in the back of your mind somehow. You don't have to believe it. It just sort of sits there. And say because it's sitting there, it's a reminder that it's still going on and it's a reminder that "no one cares today". That could be completely untrue; this Saber security event or event events are not designed to rely on truth, they are designed to influence emotion.  

So it's all fine and well trying to position ourselves around what I might believe or not believe. Whoever is doing this has realised that that doesn't even matter. What matters is what you can get out of people in a response to severe stress. Regardless of what is true and what is false.  

If anything, this experience is taught me very well that sometimes it is easier for these people to weaponise the fact that ambiguity forces us to have to engage in what could potentially true into role things out and to evidence things.  

In that regard, you go for something that's like 70% true, or you go for two lies and one truth.  

That way the target ends up burning through emotional and physical resolve just trying to work out how to even begin.  

That's what we're talking about when we talk about exhaustion as a form of containment.  

It might not look like a box to you, and all the better if it doesn't.  

It's just a way of stopping you from doing whatever you were gonna do.  

---

by the way, my favourite nudge from today, was where an email preview from a company that I've never really gotten anything from him before, readers were sending this to Downing Street, as I was writing something out.  

And ive just had a ?pulse light call.  
so yes.  

This is how mundane it can look. 

But when you spent months having people call your doorbell through the night, and the police wouldn't do anything, and the council wouldn't do anything, and you were told you couldn't have CCTV, and then you were told off for not being able to get up the next day...  

You get hypervigilant, and radio nervous system is just looking for any help at all.  

This is how the telecom interference is still imply and still actively weaponising the last bit of hope that I have.  

This is why anyone in this country who is delaying paperwork or investigation or any protection, is actively now complicit, even if they never wanted to be.  

This doesn't just happen to me; I've seen it in other whistle blowers and other activists.  

This is practised and it is systematic.  

I have no idea where any sort of review or investigation is or is not happening.  

And I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with the information I have anymore.  

I'm being left with basically a cleaner option in this country; this means I have to start putting together an ICC bundle again.  

If anyone anyone's reading and thinks, "but haven't you tried this?", then I can probably tell you yes. I probably have tried whatever that is. I've probably tried a number of times. There's onlyy so many times I can slam myself against a wall, before I have to think whether I need the extra injuries.  

Sometimes you just have to change what you're doing completely.  

But the last time I tried to do an ICC bundle, the interference went crackers. So I probably also need to get some rest. Whilst being very angry about the fact that I'm even in the situation. And also looking after my body somehow. Because the ICC is not a quick process. So I can wait for several years, with this actively continuing, and that's the best I will be able to do.  

And that my friends is the story of how easy it is to weaponise one or two contracts with either surveillance or academia or just some friends at the police, in order to threaten intimidate one person, because you personally find them inconvenient.  

It is far less slightly to be a conspiracy on any grant scale; it is far more likely that this is one or two bad actors who want to make themselves seem a lot bigger than they are.  

But if you know the system well enough, you can make it seem like there's a lot of more people on your side, just by making it almost impossible for the people who have survived you and will continue to survive you, to be able to raise the alarm so you can't put anyone else in this position ever again.
