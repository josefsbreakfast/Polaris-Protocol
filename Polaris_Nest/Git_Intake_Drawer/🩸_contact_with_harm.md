# 💉 Contact with Harm — Why Medicine Keeps Its Humanity and Security Loses It  
*On the moral physiology of feedback loops.*

## 🩺 Orientation  

In medicine, harm is not theoretical — it’s encountered.  
Every clinician who lasts long enough eventually:  
- faces the bereaved family,  
- fills in the incident form,  
- watches a complication unfold from their own error.  

That contact with harm is what forces humility into the system.  
The **Morbidity and Mortality round** is not punishment; it’s ritualised accountability.  
It’s where medicine stays human.

Security science has no such ritual.  
Its patients are abstract, its metrics sealed.  
If an intervention drives someone to breakdown or suicide, it disappears into a classified annex, not a case conference.  
The result is a discipline that confuses secrecy with ethics and absence of evidence with evidence of success.

## ⚖️ The Batting-Average Analogy  

A good surgeon can still have a 95% success rate — meaning one in twenty patients experiences serious harm.  
That transparency is what allows informed consent: the patient knows the odds.

Security frameworks claim a 100% success rate because they never count the bodies.  
No table of false positives, no “adverse events,” no near-miss register.  
A citizen cannot consent to risk they are told does not exist.

If the Prevent or CT apparatus wants to call itself “scientific,” it must start here:
- publish its **batting averages** — how many lives disrupted,  
- record **iatrogenic harm** — suicides, job losses, breakdowns,  
- treat each as a **case review**, not a PR risk.

Until then, it’s not science; it’s faith with dashboards.

## 🧠 Feedback and Immunity  

| Domain | Confrontation with Harm | Institutional Effect |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Medicine** | Direct, proximate, unavoidable | Builds humility; embeds learning loops |
| **Security** | Distal, classified, euphemised | Breeds hubris; suppresses error correction |

Medicine’s immunity to total arrogance comes from exposure.  
Security’s arrogance persists because it lives in quarantine from consequence.

## 📈 What Harm Accounting Could Look Like  

Even within classification limits, proxy metrics could restore minimal honesty:

- **Psychological morbidity** among subjects of CT investigation.  
- **Employment interruption** (>6 months post-investigation).  
- **Education attrition** rates among Prevent-referred students.  
- **Post-contact suicide or self-harm** within defined time windows.  
- **Aggregate economic loss** from mis-flagged individuals.

These are not radical measures — they’re the same epidemiological baselines used in occupational health.  
Without them, a system cannot know whether it is *saving lives or consuming them.*

---

## 🔬 The Ethical Core  

Scientific curiosity means being as interested in **when you fail** as when you succeed.  
Security science’s refusal to ask “who did we harm?” is not caution; it’s cowardice.  
A real scientist wants to know the error rate.  
A real ethicist insists that subjects know it too.

## ✴️ Polaris Hook  

Pairs with  
- **🧨 Security Science and the Performance of Precision** — theory,  
- **🪞 The Emperor’s Dashboard** — satire,  
as the ethical anchor: the demand for an M&M conference of the surveillance state.

> *“If you can’t face your complication rate, you don’t get to call it science.”*
