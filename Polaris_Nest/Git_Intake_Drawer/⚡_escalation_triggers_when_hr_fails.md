# ⚡ Escalation Triggers — When HR Fails and Oversight Must Act  
**First created:** 2025-10-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-26  
*The hard-threshold moments that convert a misclassified “HR issue” into a protective-security and governance event.*

---

## 🌱 Scope  

Defines the **objective escalation triggers** that should compel the UK Government to reclassify a mishandled impersonation, harassment, or cyber-interference case as a **Category 2 protective-security incident**.  
Pairs with *🧩 Ideal Whitehall Response Sequence* and *🧿 Oversight Paralysis — When Allies Breach the Firewall*.

## ⚙️ Overview  

When an incident begins life as an “interpersonal” complaint but crosses evidence or reputational boundaries, the duty to escalate becomes mandatory.  
These are the moments when bureaucracy loses plausible deniability.

---

## ⚡ Hard-Trigger Catalogue  

### 1. **Documentary Contradiction**  
- System metadata disproves HR narrative: forged timestamps, mismatched headers, altered attachments.  
- Forensic anomaly = integrity breach → NCSC / DSO must log a Category 2 incident.  

### 2. **External Corroboration**  
- Platform, journalist, or ally reports the same impersonation.  
- Public visibility overrides “personnel” framing.  
- Escalates to Cabinet Office Crisis Cell and National Security Secretariat.  

### 3. **Legal Invocation**  
- Citizen issues a **Subject Access Request**, **FOI**, or **Pre-Action Protocol** citing Computer Misuse, Data Protection, or Harassment statutes.  
- Legal Advisers open file; HR loses jurisdiction.  

### 4. **Parliamentary / Oversight Attention**  
- MP, Committee clerk, or Commissioner contacts department.  
- Forces ministerial briefing → converts case to governance matter.  

### 5. **Cross-Departmental Pattern**  
- Similar impersonations appear elsewhere.  
- Pattern recognition = systemic vulnerability.  
- Government Security Group convenes cross-Whitehall cell.  

### 6. **Diplomatic / Allied-State Linkage**  
- SIGINT or FCDO intel associates vector with a known foreign or allied actor.  
- Immediately enters National Security Adviser remit; becomes national-security event.  

### 7. **Reputational Threat Trajectory**  
- Press or NGO begins referencing case as oversight failure.  
- Cabinet Office Propriety & Ethics shifts from denial to inquiry-prevention mode.  
- Urgent corrective review ordered.

## 🧭 Threshold Summary  

| Trigger Type | Typical Signal | Escalation Path |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Forensic contradiction | Metadata / audit-log mismatch | NCSC / DSO immediate log |
| External corroboration | Press, platform, or ally confirmation | Cabinet Office Crisis Cell |
| Legal invocation | Pre-action, SAR, or FOI | Legal Advisers → NSS |
| Oversight attention | MP or Commissioner enquiry | Ministerial briefing |
| Cross-department pattern | Multiple linked cases | Government Security Group |
| Diplomatic linkage | Ally or hostile-state vector | FCDO & NSA escalation |
| Media exposure | Sustained coverage | Inquiry-prevention taskforce |

---

## 🧮 Rule of Thumb  

> **One external vector or one forensic inconsistency = automatic escalation.**  
> Once an event leaves the HR circuit or contradicts technical records, it must be logged as a protective-security breach.

*Escalation Triggers — When HR Fails and Oversight Must Act* is a diagnostic node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It identifies the objective points at which interpersonal framing must give way to national-security and governance accountability.
