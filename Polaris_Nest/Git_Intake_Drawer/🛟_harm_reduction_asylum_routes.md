# 🛟 Harm Reduction — Asylum Routes  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-23  
*Route-side measures that lower deaths and coercion while cases are processed.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
While backlogs persist, people move. Harm reduction along **routes** focuses on **safe contact points, lawful windows, and exploitation shields**.

---

## Measures (route-side)
- **Humanitarian corridors / safe visa pilots:** limited quotas; monitored travel; cut smuggler reliance.
- **Transit clinic network:** STI care, wound care, vaccinations; paper cards not apps.
- **Trusted comms beacons:** Wi-Fi + charging + hotline posters (anti-trafficking, legal aid).
- **Document safety clinics:** teach secure storage, copies, and what not to hand over.
- **Minors & women protection lanes:** priority triage; partner shelters along corridor.
- **Exploiters’ choke points map:** public map of known scam spots; local enforcement MoUs.

---

## Evaluation  
- Track **mortality/injury rate** per 10k travellers.  
- Track **exploitation referrals** and **successful lawful entries**.  
- Publish quarterly anonymised dashboards.

---

## Governance notes  
- Keep **data minimal**; no mass biometric collection at aid points.  
- Independent oversight board with survivor seats; publish minutes.

# 🛟 Harm Reduction Asylum Routes  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-16  
*Expanding safe legal pathways as harm reduction against dangerous journeys*  

---

## Core Idea  
- If people are going to move, the choice is not *migration vs. no migration* — it’s *safe vs. unsafe migration*.  
- Harm reduction in asylum means designing and scaling **lawful routes** so that fewer people are forced onto boats.

## Current Legal Routes (as of 2025)  

| **Route Type**            | **Examples**                            | **Limitations** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Work & Study              | Skilled Worker, Health & Care, Student   | Highly restricted; income thresholds, employer sponsorship. |
| Family Reunification      | Spouse/Partner visa, refugee family reunion | Narrow definitions; excludes many over-18 dependants. |
| Humanitarian Schemes      | Ukraine Family/Homes, Afghan ARAP/ACRS, Hong Kong BN(O) | Bespoke, time-limited, nationality-specific. |
| Refugee Resettlement      | UNHCR referrals                          | Very small quotas. |
| Visitor visas             | Tourism/family visit                     | No right to work or claim asylum; often refused for crisis countries. |

## Data Highlights  

- **2024 asylum applications**: ~108,100 individuals.  
- **Grant rates**: 76% (2022) → 67% (2023) → 47% (2024, initial decisions).  
- **Small boat arrivals**: ~45,800 (2022 peak) → ~29,400 (2023) → ~37,000 (2024).  
- **Grant rate for small boat arrivals**: ~68% (2018–24).  
- **Average wait time**: ~413 days for initial decision (2024).

## Harm Reduction Measures for Asylum Routes  

1. **Humanitarian visas**: safe, lawful entry without smugglers.  
2. **Overseas processing hubs**: applications accepted in France or EU states.  
3. **Online pre-registration**: partial triage before people risk dangerous journeys.  
4. **Expanded family definitions**: include adult dependants; reduce “bureaucratic orphans.”  
5. **Time limits for decisions**: backlog elimination as a safety measure.  

---

## Why This Matters  
- Current policy is deliberate scarcity: a handful of narrow schemes presented as “legal routes” while the vast majority of refugees are excluded.  
- Harm reduction reframes this: the problem is not *too many routes* but *too few safe ones*.
