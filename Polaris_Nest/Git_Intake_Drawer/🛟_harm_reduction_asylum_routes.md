*Route-side measures that lower deaths and coercion while cases are processed.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
While backlogs persist, people move. Harm reduction along **routes** focuses on **safe contact points, lawful windows, and exploitation shields**.

---

## Measures (route-side)
- **Humanitarian corridors / safe visa pilots:** limited quotas; monitored travel; cut smuggler reliance.
- **Transit clinic network:** STI care, wound care, vaccinations; paper cards not apps.
- **Trusted comms beacons:** Wi-Fi + charging + hotline posters (anti-trafficking, legal aid).
- **Document safety clinics:** teach secure storage, copies, and what not to hand over.
- **Minors & women protection lanes:** priority triage; partner shelters along corridor.
- **Exploiters’ choke points map:** public map of known scam spots; local enforcement MoUs.

---

## Evaluation  
- Track **mortality/injury rate** per 10k travellers.  
- Track **exploitation referrals** and **successful lawful entries**.  
- Publish quarterly anonymised dashboards.

---

## Governance notes  
- Keep **data minimal**; no mass biometric collection at aid points.  
- Independent oversight board with survivor seats; publish minutes.
