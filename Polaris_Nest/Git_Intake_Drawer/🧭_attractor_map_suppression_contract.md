## 🔑 Reading Notes  

- **Two cores, many echoes.** 🔥 *Suppression as Signal* governs epistemic patterns (silence, visibility, trace). ⚖️ *Containment Contract Trace* governs legal-mechanical patterns (consent, licence, authorship).  
- **Dual inheritance.** Nodes like **🩸 Soul as Product Lineage** sit in the gravitational overlap: essence becomes product *when* it is both rendered legible (🔥) *and* made ownable (⚖️).  
- **Motif flows.** Dotted lines mark *pressure paths* (e.g., **Frankenstack → Metadata Sabotage** via paperwork residue). Solid lines mark direct conceptual descent.

This attractor map is a living diagram of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
Update when a node’s centre of gravity shifts (e.g., if *Ritual as Infrastructure* becomes a third attractor).

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Cartography is consent.*
