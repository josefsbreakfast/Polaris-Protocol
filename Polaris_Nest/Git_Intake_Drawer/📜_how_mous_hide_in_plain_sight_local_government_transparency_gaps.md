# 📜 How MOUs Hide in Plain Sight — Local Government Transparency Gaps  
**First created:** 2025-11-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-05  
*The paperwork that never quite counts as a contract.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Councils are legally obliged to publish information about contracts, tenders, and senior interests.  
Yet some of the most politically sensitive relationships — especially in **security, resilience, and data-sharing** — exist in documents carefully drafted **not** to trigger those duties.

This node explains how **Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)** and similar “non-binding” agreements hide in plain sight, and how to hunt them using OSINT and the law that already exists.

## 🧩 What Should Be Transparent (On Paper)  

- **Local Government Transparency Code 2015**  
  - Contracts and tenders over £5,000  
  - Grants, organograms, pay of senior staff  
- **Public Contracts Regulations 2015**  
  - Major procurements on **Find a Tender** / Contracts Finder  
- **Localism Act 2011 (s.27–32)**  
  - Register of members’ interests; some senior-officer conflicts  
- **Freedom of Information Act 2000**  
  - Right of access to recorded information, including MOUs  
- **Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014**  
  - Public right to inspect accounting records and contracts

So: agreements using public resources, data, or reputation should either be **published** or **disclosable**.

## 🧩 How MOUs Slip the Net  

| Tactic | Description | Effect |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **“Non-binding” wording** | Document states it is “not legally binding” and “does not create enforceable obligations.” | Council argues it is not a *contract*, so Transparency Code and procurement rules don’t apply. |
| **Security framing** | MOU is presented as part of “counter-terrorism”, “resilience” or “law enforcement cooperation.” | FOI exemptions (national security, law enforcement) used to withhold text. |
| **Subsidiary route** | Agreements run via council-owned companies, LEPs or joint ventures. | Transparency obligations may not extend to separate corporate bodies. |
| **Generic summaries** | Public documents mention “Innovation Partnership with X” but don’t attach the underlying text. | Looks open; hides specifics (data flows, exclusivity, IP terms). |
| **Commercial-confidentiality claims** | FOI responses cite s.43 FOIA (commercial interests) to refuse disclosure. | Shifts burden to citizen to appeal to the ICO. |

The result is **lawful opacity**: nothing technically illegal, but the public cannot see who their council is in bed with.

## 🧠 Why This Matters for Civil Security  

Hidden MOUs are often:

- Data-sharing arrangements with **police, intelligence, or private vendors**.  
- **Resilience or security partnerships** with firms whose products touch on protest, diaspora communities, or border policy.  
- Frameworks allowing **pilot projects** that would be controversial if openly described.

When diaspora groups or activists meet polite “neutrality” language from councils, they may in fact be up against **unseen commitments** embedded in these documents.

## 🧩 OSINT Methods — Hunting the Invisible  

1. **Read the Constitution**  
   - Look for sections on *Partnerships*, *Joint Arrangements*, *Delegations*.  
   - Many councils maintain a **Partnership Register** in an appendix — often out of date, but a starting point.

2. **Search committee papers**  
   - Scrutiny, Cabinet, and Audit committees often reference partnerships by name.  
   - Keywords: “Memorandum of Understanding”, “collaboration agreement”, “pilot”, “innovation partnership”, “resilience programme”.

3. **Use FOI precisely**  
   - Ask for:  
     > “All memoranda of understanding, partnership agreements or non-binding collaboration documents between [Council] and [X] from [year] to [year], including any annexes.”  
   - If refused on s.43 or s.24/s.31 grounds, **appeal** and ask for partial redaction rather than wholesale refusal.

4. **Follow the money**  
   - Check payment data over £500 and contracts registers for repeated entries against one vendor.  
   - Even if the MOU is “non-binding,” associated purchase orders will leave a trace.

5. **Look at company reporting**  
   - Vendors often boast about partnerships on their own websites and in investor reports.  
   - Cross-reference their claims with your council’s silence.

6. **Use audit-inspection season**  
   - During the summer inspection window, use your right to inspect *contracts and “all books, deeds, contracts, bills, vouchers and receipts”* related to the accounts.  
   - Ask specifically for *“documentation governing the relationship with [X] including any memoranda of understanding.”*

## 🧩 Practical FOI Wording (Template)  

> **Subject:** Request for Partnership and MOU Documentation  
>  
> Dear [Council Name] FOI Officer,  
>  
> Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, please provide:  
> 1. Copies of any memoranda of understanding, partnership agreements, collaboration agreements or similar documents (including non-binding arrangements) between [Council] and [Organisation X] from [year] to [year].  
> 2. Any appendix, schedule or annex attached to those documents.  
> 3. The date on which each arrangement was approved and the officer or committee responsible for approval.  
>  
> If you consider that any exemptions apply, please provide the remainder of the documents in redacted form, rather than withholding them in full.  
>  
> Yours faithfully,  
> [Your Name]
