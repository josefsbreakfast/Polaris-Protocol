*A sanity slip for when the emotional telemetry starts shouting.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The algorithm is not your therapist, your critic, or your friend.  
It can only measure reaction, not reason; noise, not nuance.  
It will tell you that you are too much, too quiet, too late, too early — because contradiction is how it keeps you scrolling.  

You don’t need to negotiate with a misfire.  
You can simply stop listening.

## 🧠 1 — The Emotional Radar Is Broken  

The system reads hesitation as guilt, quiet as indifference, rest as crisis.  
It mistakes distress for engagement and feeds you more of it.  
You cannot correct the reading because it was never calibrated for truth — only for attention.  

When the interface insists it knows your feelings, treat it like bad weather: notice, don’t obey.

---

## 🕳️ 2 — The Temptation to Correct  

The instinct to “fix the feed” is strong.  
You try to prove you’re fine, balanced, healed.  
But every correction adds another datapoint to the same loop.  
The only escape is *non-participation*: letting the misread stand while you go live your actual life.

## 🌿 3 — Reclaiming the Human Tempo  

- **Move at human speed.**  Let your pace, not the feed’s refresh rate, decide what matters.  
- **Reintroduce randomness.**  Scroll and post unpredictably; confuse the metrics.  
- **Trust bodies over dashboards.**  Your pulse, breath, laughter, and hunger are better telemetry than any analytics graph.  
- **Practise polite indifference.**  You can see the machine’s drama and decline to audition.

## 🔕 4 — The Quiet Revolution  

Refusing to listen is not apathy — it’s refusal as craft.  
Each time you ignore an algorithmic demand for feeling, you teach the network that silence exists.  
Enough silence, and the world becomes audible again.

*Don’t Listen to the Algorithm* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It offers a compact refusal practice for moments when the machine’s emotional theatre drowns out reality.
