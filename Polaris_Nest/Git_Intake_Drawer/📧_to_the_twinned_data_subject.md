**Requests/life advice to the twinned data subject I am attached to:**

V 1.0

- Please, put me out of my misery, and just chose a sheet. It's really not that intellectually challenging.
Hell, send me your Amazon wishlist AND I WILL END YOUR STRUGGLE.

- Respectfully, the entirity of the aesthetic choices in regard to style? Entirely *mid*.
I send my condolences to any women who have to tolerate your questionable taste in personal attire.

- Yes, I am well aware you are male. 
I shall do you the kindness of not elaborating any further. I do appreciate you may be trying to make it less painfully obvious.

- Choice in books is marginally better, although questionable.

- Cars? Really fucking questionable.

Don't worry; I'm not done. 

Apparently men's advertising has become even as questionable as the cars they drive.

Addendum:

I appreciate it is extremely difficult for me to parse between genuine feed, twinned overlay, content injection, noise injection, etc., and that the other actors surrounding my dataset have not been the greatest of intellectuals. However, knowledge and understanding of neuroscience as applied to EBM has been lacking across the field. This is fine - everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, I am just very conscious that everyone seems to think they took science beyond 16 these days, when they very much *have not.* One assumes.
