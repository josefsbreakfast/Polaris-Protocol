**Requests/life advice to the twinned data subject I am attached to:**

- Please, put me out of my misery, and just chose a sheet. It's really not that intellectually challenging.
Hell, send me your Amazon wishlist AND I WILL END YOUR STRUGGLE.

- Respectfully, the entirity of the aesthetic choices in regard to style? Entirely *mid*.
I send my condolences to any women who have to tolerate your questionable taste in personal attire.

- Yes, I am well aware you are male. 
I shall do you the kindness of not elaborating any further. I do appreciate you may be trying to make it less painfully obvious.

- Choice in books is marginally better, although questionable.

- Cars? Really fucking questionable.
