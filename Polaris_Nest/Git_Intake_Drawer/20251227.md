we've moved onto a round of somewhat coded threats against family members, but it lacks the specificity required to have it taken sincerely by the police force who has juristiction in my area, and it's only relevant in a course of conduct, so i cannot flag it with any expectation to ncsc etc.  

with the growing trend of individuals with a greater liklihood of zombie data accumulstion snd frankenstack exposure talking about similar experiences to the nuisance behaviour online, and with the incedibly weak protections for anyone experiencing the floods of behaviour and exposure which can be reasonably interpreted as threatening, this is a clear gap which leave us exposed systematically.  

idk russia pits a plane or a ship into our terrotory every few months - why wouldn't a 15 trillion dollar industry poke at uk citizens? if you're cold about the ethics, there is huge potential for moments of oppotunity as defined under capitalist evonomics, so lots of money to make. pretending this oesn't exist doesn't stop it.
