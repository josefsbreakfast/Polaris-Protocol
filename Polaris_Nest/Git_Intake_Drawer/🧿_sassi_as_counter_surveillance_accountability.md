# 🧿 SASSI as Counter-Surveillance Accountability
**First created:** 2025-11-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*Forensic proof-of-concept for citizen-led audit and containment of surveillance infrastructure.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Southerners Against Surveillance Systems & Infrastructure (SASSI) show how a small regional collective can perform the work of an entire oversight body.  
Through records requests, public analysis, and civic education, they transformed scattered fragments of procurement data into a *forensic map* of the surveillance economy.  

This node frames SASSI as a **counter-surveillance accountability mechanism**—a replicable civic architecture that exposes how public money becomes infrastructural control.

---

## 🧩 Key Mechanisms  

1. **Forensic Documentation** — converting ARPA grant tables, vendor invoices, and FOI releases into legible public evidence.  
2. **Distributed Oversight** — turning every resident or researcher into a micro-auditor through shared templates and primers.  
3. **Undertone Fidelity** — using accessible language, not bureaucratic abstraction, to keep moral clarity intact.  
4. **Vendor Cartography** — linking Flock, Fusus, Cellebrite, ShotSpotter, and others into one ecosystem map.  
5. **Local Resonance** — framing surveillance as a *neighbourhood issue*, not a national abstraction.  

---

## 🔍 Analytical Summary  

SASSI proves that **accountability can scale horizontally**:  
- No formal subpoena power.  
- No official budget.  
- Yet through meticulous data work they built the only public, navigable view of southern US surveillance infrastructure.  

This is **civic forensics as democratic function**—a model jurisdictions elsewhere can adopt long before state institutions mature enough to self-police.

## 🧭 Replication Blueprint  

| Phase | Action | Outcome |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Discovery | Identify public funding streams (e.g. ARPA, policing grants) | Source documents |
| Extraction | File FOI / public-records requests | Gather contracts + vendor lists |
| Analysis | Build open spreadsheets + visual maps | Reveal systemic procurement patterns |
| Publication | Release findings in plain language | Civic visibility, journalist uptake |
| Maintenance | Train others to reuse templates | Sustained accountability network |

*🧿 SASSI as Counter-Surveillance Accountability* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents SASSI as a functional prototype of civic accountability for surveillance infrastructure, demonstrating that forensic clarity can emerge from collective will rather than institutional mandate.
