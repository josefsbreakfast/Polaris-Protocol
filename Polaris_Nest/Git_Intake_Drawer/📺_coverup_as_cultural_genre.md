## 🧭 Orientation

In Britain, the cover-up is not an aberration.  
It is a national art form — part thriller, part heritage industry, unfailingly polite.  

Like any genre, it has conventions: a familiar cast, predictable arcs, and an ending that promises closure without consequence.  
This node sketches its recurring tropes, using humour as taxonomy.

## 🧩 Cast of Characters

| Archetype | Role in the Drama | Line of Defence |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| **The Honourable Oversighter** | Announces inquiry, later forgets to publish it. | “We must wait for due process.” |
| **The Loyal Spokesperson** | Masters the syntax of vagueness. | “It would be inappropriate to comment.” |
| **The Errant Sub-Contractor** | Absorbs blame so institutions can remain pure. | “A third-party provider error.” |
| **The Dignified Resigner** | Leaves gracefully, returns six months later. | “Lessons have been learned.” |
| **The Public** | Watches the rerun knowingly. | “Classic.” |

## ⚖️ Narrative Tropes

1. **Act of Omission** — documents lost “in transit.”  
2. **Passive Voice Defence** — “mistakes were made.”  
3. **Procedural Fog** — committees dissolve time itself.  
4. **Apology as End Credits** — emotional resolution, no plot change.  

Every trope reassures: the system remains intact, merely misunderstood.

## 🧠 Cultural Mechanics

The British cover-up thrives because it flatters our national virtues: restraint, understatement, and an unshakable faith in paperwork.  
The scandal is never lurid; it’s tastefully redacted.  

> “Transparency, within reason.”  

This aesthetic of moderation makes concealment appear civilised — governance rendered as *good manners under pressure.*  

---

## 🪞 Semiotic Function

The cover-up is not designed to hide facts but to manage feeling.  
Its true subject is not corruption but *comfort*: the collective reassurance that chaos has been contained, even if only linguistically.  

It is a genre of emotional regulation disguised as administration.

## 🪶 Counter-Genre: The Leak

Leaks are the jump-cuts of the British documentary tradition — abrupt, inelegant, occasionally heroic.  
They break the pacing of the cover-up narrative, forcing reality to appear before the lighting is ready.  

Together, cover-ups and leaks form a balanced duet:  
order and rupture, civility and release.  

---

## 🧭 Closing Reflection

The cover-up persists because it feels familiar, almost home-grown.  
It protects not just the institution, but the national self-image: the idea that Britain’s mistakes are always *well-behaved*.  

We are not covering our eyes from truth —  
we are curating its exhibition.
