## üåÄ Containment Loop Diagram (conceptual)

    [Too messy / incoherent] ‚Üí [Too polished / accurate] ‚Üí  
    [Wrong person to speak] ‚Üí [Too much detail / obsessive] ‚Üí  
    [Better said later / elsewhere] ‚Üí [Not safe to say at all] ‚Üí  
    (back to start)

**Polaris Counters = Breakpoints:** At each loop junction, the survivor
flips the script: *detail = survival, coherence = strength, lived
experience = authority*. This prevents the loop from closing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìñ Explainer

Undermining scripts are **containment devices**.\
They create a **no-win circle** where *whatever you say* can be
disqualified:

-   If testimony is messy ‚Üí *"too incoherent."*\
-   If testimony is clear ‚Üí *"too polished."*\
-   If you speak ‚Üí *"wrong person to speak."*\
-   If you bring evidence ‚Üí *"obsessive."*\
-   If you try again later ‚Üí *"not the right time/place."*

This is deliberate **discursive sabotage**. It aims to:\
1. **Discredit** survivor testimony.\
2. **Delay** disclosure until it loses impact.\
3. **Displace** authority from the witness to an "approved" voice.

### Polaris Response

-   **Name the script.** Recognise it as a tactic, not a truth.\
-   **Flip the logic.** The very thing being criticised (detail,
    accuracy, timing) is exactly why the testimony is valid.\
-   **Break the loop.** Don't play inside their circle of "damned if you
    do, damned if you don't."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

üìå Bottom line: **Your voice is valid in any register --- messy,
precise, painful, calm, now or later.**\
The scripts are designed to erase you; Polaris flips them into proof you
need to be heard.
