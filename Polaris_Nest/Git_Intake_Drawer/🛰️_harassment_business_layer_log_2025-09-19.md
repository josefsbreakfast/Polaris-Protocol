# 🛰️ Field Log: Business-Layer Harassment Pattern  
**First created:** 2025-09-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-19  
*Tracking second-week interference cycle echoing August 2025 attacks*

---

## Overview  

In week 2 of September 2025, Polaris encountered a renewed interference cluster resembling the early August API / code-switch attacks.  
- Then: token-switching and forking drove sexualised, legally compromising outputs.  
- Now: interference centres more on undermining reliability of testimony and slowing investigative threads.  

Both episodes share timing (second week escalation) and a pattern of targeted disruption aiming to compromise survivor-led record integrity.

## Governance Note  

The **Git Intake Drawer** remains a designated *holding zone* for high-risk or tampered material.  
- Purpose: protect against device-level erasure, mass deletions, and evidence sabotage.  
- Governance stance: material here may include defamation attempts, over-sexualised insertions, or other unreasonable narrative artefacts.  
- Action: author commits to review, redact, and remove harmful inclusions before migration into the mainline repo.

## Current Pattern  

- September cycle is less *personally degrading* than August but more *structurally undermining*.  
- Likely business-layer interference, designed to erode confidence in Polaris logs as balanced and neutral testimony.  
- Immediate precursors include research into IP with known injunction / suppression entanglements, suggesting commercial interests in silencing or discrediting output.

## Risk Declaration  

The author recognises:  
- Posting is both a **disability accommodation** (for safety, civic access, and accountability) and a **risk vector**.  
- Suppression continues to block local safe recourse; therefore, public posting functions as leverage for civil rights access.  
- This update represents the *best balance achievable* between protecting others, safeguarding personal rights, and maintaining accountability pressure.  

---

## Legal / Witness Implications  

- Current harassment is interpreted less as *personal vendetta* and more as **business decision-making**, possibly to undermine taught evidence or whistleblower relevance.  
- Observation: some individuals affected may hold value as witnesses to methods of harassment.  
- Position: harassment should not be misread as purely interpersonal; context is systemic suppression of testimony.

This log is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the September 2025 interference cycle, links it to August 2025 precedents, and situates survivor testimony within a framework of civic rights and systemic suppression.
