## 🧭 Orientation  

This node traces the uneasy choreography between **recorded harm** and **recorded death** —  
how, across the decade 2015–2025, the count of sexual assaults and the rate of female suicides moved in opposite directions, then both disappeared into methodological fog.  
The goal is not precision; it is pattern recognition of **institutional dissociation**.

## 📈 Reading the Pattern  

1. **2015 → 2019** — steady rise in reported sexual assault as #MeToo and disclosure increase; suicides drift slightly down.  
2. **2020–2021** — pandemic silence; the question itself suspended.  
3. **2022** — rebound in reporting; suicides stall instead of falling.  
4. **2023** — statistical blackout; “methodological redesign” replaces measurement.  
5. **2024** — “all sexes” proxy introduced; apparent drop in assaults, female suicide returns to 2015 levels.  

The ratio that should stabilise never does.  
Each “no significant change” is a bureaucratic anaesthetic: a system sedating itself against recognition.

## 💣  Narrative Analysis  

Between 2015 and 2025, the line that was meant to fall—female suicide—climbed back to where it began.  
The line that was meant to clarify—sexual-assault prevalence—fractured into missing modules, merged categories, and disclaimers.  
The coincidence is too exact to be accidental: when institutions cannot face a rise in violence, they **redefine the question** until the curve appears flat.  

When the self-completion module vanished, so did the safest route for survivors to disclose.  
When it returned, it came blurred across “all sexes,” dissolving the asymmetry that MeToo had made visible.  
Neutrality became a laundering device: the illusion of continuity concealing rupture.  

Meanwhile, expressive misogyny migrated from forum to street—racialised rapes in the Midlands, influencer-incited assaults, chants of “get off the boat.”  
The dataset calls it “no statistically significant change.”  
Reality calls it a counter-movement.  

This is what suppression looks like when it learns statistics: every silence rendered to three decimal places.

## 🚢  The Scapegoat Circuit  

When the record goes silent, the story grows loud.  
The politics of **“Stop the Boats”** thrives in the statistical blind spot between a *measurable rise in sexualised harm* and a *bureaucratic refusal to name its cause*.  
Women feel the shift in their daily perimeter—catcalls, voyeurism, violence—but the system that once translated private fear into public evidence has gone missing for a year.  

Into that vacuum walks a ready villain.  
If sexual violence seems everywhere and official data appear contradictory, the populist can always point elsewhere: migrants, refugees, the Other who supposedly imported danger.  
The narrative sells because the emotional data are real—even when the empirical data are corrupted.  

In truth, the spike signals something **endogenous**:  
local councils collapsing under austerity, social-service backlogs stretching into triage, policing cultures unable or unwilling to manage misogyny within their own ranks.  
When institutional bandwidth collapses, *suppression looks like reprioritisation*.  
A spreadsheet gets deferred; a question removed “for redesign”; a release delayed “for quality assurance.”  
To the bureaucrat, it’s a workflow issue.  
To the survivor, it’s another disappearance.  

The timing betrays intent even if the actors meant none:  
- 2021–22 — survey module suspended, safeguarding stretched;  
- 2022 — “banned” book released;  
- 2022–23 — public anger without official footing;  
- 2023 — far-right narrative gains traction;  
- 2024 — data return, now diluted to “all sexes.”  

When truth is administratively delayed, extremism fills the reporting gap.  
The moral panic is a data product.

## 🕯  The Human Ledger  

Behind every ratio is a person who stopped being counted in first person.  
The recent rebound in female suicides lands inside an atmosphere of **co-ordinated, transnational misogyny** that many women recognise viscerally.  
In the same years that official data lost its footing, women have watched:  

- the French case of a husband who for years orchestrated nightly assaults against his wife;  
- mass takedowns of online communities—tens of thousands of men—trading “advice,” trophies, and how-to guides on sexual assault;  
- the rhetoric of domination move from niche forums to mainstream politics, justified as “free speech” or “border control.”  

To live through that visibility is to feel both *seen* and *disbelieved*: women are told to dull themselves, moderate tone, be reasonable—while the cost of that self-containment is increasingly fatal.  
The line on the chart is grief made measurable.  

No statistic can isolate motive. Cost-of-living stress, service collapse, care burden—all matter.  
But even allowing for those factors, the protective patterns that usually hold women back from suicide—care for dependants, community duty, endurance as strategy—are failing.  
That suggests not only economic pressure but **existential exhaustion**: the sense that the social contract itself has withdrawn reciprocity.  

To speak of correlation here is not to claim causation; it is to name a climate.  
In a decade that taught women to record everything, the price of that awareness has been collective despair.

## 🧠  Interpretation  

- **Policy amnesia:** Every methodological tweak rewrites the past; absence becomes plausible deniability.  
- **Containment fatigue:** Protective rhetoric outlasts funding; suicide rebound marks system collapse.  
- **Expressive backlash:** Public misogyny as ritual compensation for lost entitlement.  
- **Metric inversion:** A flat rate can signal under-counting as much as stability.  
- **Ethical implication:** Data stability is not moral stability—sometimes it’s the quiet that kills.

*📈 The Ratio That Shouldn’t Exist* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It fuses quantitative record and survivor undertone to show how measurement itself becomes a site of harm — where omission is policy and format is containment.
