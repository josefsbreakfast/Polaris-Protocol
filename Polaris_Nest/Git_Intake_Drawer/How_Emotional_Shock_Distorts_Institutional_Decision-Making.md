*Why emotional shock inside institutions leads to paralysis, poor decisions, and fragmented communication.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Institutions are made of people.  
When those people experience emotional shock — discovering internal harm, realising a failure, recognising a missed risk — decision-making distorts temporarily.

This node maps shock as a governance factor.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Shock Happens Before Procedure  
Shock precedes:  
- policy  
- protocol  
- training  
- decision-making  

Emotional systems react before institutional systems activate.

---

### 2. Shock Produces Distortions  
Common distortions include:
- tunnel vision  
- withdrawal  
- inconsistent statements  
- over-formality  
- avoidance  
- sudden escalation or sudden silence  
- inability to process simple emails  

These distortions create administrative chaos.

---

### 3. Shock Spreads  
Shock “infects” departments:
- one staff member panics  
- their avoidance triggers another  
- multiple teams freeze  
- information flow collapses  

This is how micro-shock becomes macro-confusion.

---

### 4. Shock Resolves Slowly  
Only once emotion stabilises do:
- timelines reconstruct  
- responsibilities clarify  
- acknowledgment become possible  
- procedural logic return  

Shock explains why survivors move faster than institutions.
