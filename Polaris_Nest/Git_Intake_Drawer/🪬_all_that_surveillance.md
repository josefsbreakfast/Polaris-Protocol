all that surveillance and all that technology and all that behavoural insight.  

how the fuck could you not protect the diaspora on yom kippur.  

the entire industrial and technological might of multiple empire-born nations  

and you're telling me  

none of you managed to fucking prevent it?  

what the fuck are you even surveilling if we are left scared to ask g-d for forgiveness for whatever we didn't do last year?  

it's looking a lot like we were only an excuse these days.  

no one needs to know halacha to know that shit ain't right.  

and even as two bodies of my community lie broken and another lost after they killed two whole universes,  

i am praying that the suspect doesn't look anything like my friends.  

i never said i was perfect.  

i have always said that this hydra of western hatred and its heads and its harms fucking scare me.  

may their memories be a blessing.  

i don't have anything good to say.  

i am already a selfish moment of fear,

praying that the suspect looks nothing like anyone i have ever loved.
