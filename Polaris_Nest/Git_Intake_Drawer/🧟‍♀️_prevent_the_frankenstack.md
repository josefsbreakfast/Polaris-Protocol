🪐 PREVENT’s Frankenstack Architecture
First created: 2025-11-17 | Last updated: 2025-11-17
How PREVENT sits on top of overlapping, incompatible, and repurposed data systems that behave unpredictably when combined.

⸻

Orientation
This note describes how PREVENT operates inside a larger digital and institutional environment made up of loosely connected systems, mismatched datasets, vendor pipelines, legacy software, and behavioural frameworks that were never designed to interact. The result is a “Frankenstack”: a patchwork system whose emergent behaviour is more complex and more harmful than any single component. This is structural rather than conspiratorial.

Key Features
• PREVENT relies on data environments it doesn’t control or understand.
• University, health, policing, and vendor systems leak logic into each other.
• Legacy technology amplifies bias, interpretation errors, and over-escalation.
• Emergent outcomes feel targeted, even when produced by system interaction.

What a “Frankenstack” means here
A Frankenstack is a collection of digital and organisational systems that were never designed to work together but have become intertwined through shared vendors, data reuse, poor integration, or policy pressure. These systems include clinical notes, safeguarding databases, university engagement analytics, police information systems, local authority tools, and behavioural models.

Why PREVENT becomes entangled
PREVENT pulls information from multiple environments, many of which were built for completely different purposes. Each system contributes fragments of context, metadata, or behavioural interpretation. When combined, these fragments produce signals that appear meaningful but are often noise, duplication, or misinterpretation.

Key components feeding the PREVENT Frankenstack
• university digital learning analytics
• attendance and engagement dashboards
• mental health records (in partial or summarised forms)
• local authority safeguarding systems
• legacy police IT
• vendor-provided risk or behaviour tools
• multi-agency “hunch-driven” reporting forms
• staff perceptions shaped by training templates
• repeated behavioural research pipelines
All of these systems interact indirectly, not through design but through practice.

Why emergent behaviour feels targeted
Because multiple systems reuse similar datasets or interpret similar behavioural indicators, a pattern can emerge that feels like profiling. In reality, the pattern is accidental: it is the product of overlapping biases, repeated assumptions, and drift across data environments. The person experiencing this sees coherence; the system is producing it by accident.

How this architecture produces harm
• misinterpreted distress or trauma
• duplicated concerns appearing as escalation
• older flags resurfacing due to metadata drift
• staff acting on partial information
• algorithms trained on reused datasets amplifying bias
• institutional gossip filling in gaps where data is unclear
• inconsistent thresholds across agencies
This combination funnels people into PREVENT even when no genuine risk exists.

Why capacity collapse makes the Frankenstack worse
Overloaded staff rely more on digital tools, templates, and “better safe than sorry” heuristics. The more fragile the system, the more it depends on the architecture that is already flawed. PREVENT inherits the dysfunction of the entire ecosystem.

Implications for future reform
Reform cannot target PREVENT alone; the Frankenstack includes education, health, local authorities, policing, vendors, and outdated IT stacks. Any redesign must address the interconnected environment, not just the referral pathway.

PREVENT’s Frankenstack Architecture is a node in the Governance & Prevent cluster. It explains how overlapping data environments and institutional fragility create emergent behaviours that resemble intentional profiling but arise from systemic entanglement.
