*Practical and psychological tools for leaving a respectability‑laundered extremist space before it captures you.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Walk‑Out Scripts are **exit strategies** for moments when an apparently respectable event reveals an extremist core.

Politeness, status anxiety and shock keep people in rooms they should leave. This node gives language and internal prompts to walk out safely and calmly.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Socially plausible exit lines.  
- Internal self‑talk to override paralysis.  
- Role‑specific scripts (MPs, academics, journalists, clergy, business).

- Aftercare steps.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Core Rule  
You do not need to earn your exit.

> “This is not what I thought it was.  
> Leaving is self‑respect, not rudeness.”

### 2. Soft Exit Scripts  
- “Sorry, I’m needed for another call.”  
- “Not feeling great, I need some fresh air.”  
- “I’ve double‑booked myself—must slip out.”

### 3. Boundary Scripts  
- “This isn’t what I expected, I’m going to leave.”  
- “I’m not comfortable with where this is going.”  

### 4. Hard Line Scripts  
- “This is crossing into something I won’t be part of.”  
- “I can’t remain here in good conscience.”

### 5. Internal Self‑Talk  
- “If my stomach says leave, I leave.”  
- “Politeness will not save me.”  
- “Leaving is neutral; staying can be costly.”  

### 6. Aftercare  
Once out:

- breathe  
- drink water  
- text someone trusted  
- name what felt wrong  
- note the cues for future recognition  

Every exit strengthens your internal compass.
