# ⚠️ Alt‑Right Threat to Both Parties  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*How the alt‑right simultaneously corrodes Labour and the Conservatives by collapsing democratic operating conditions.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node maps the **bidirectional threat** posed by the UK’s alt‑right ecosystem (Reform UK, GB News, NatCon orbit, online outrage networks).

It does not threaten just one party.  
It threatens the **operational viability of both** major parties and the wider democratic system.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- The alt‑right’s goal is collapse, not stable governance.  
- Conservatives are cannibalised and radicalised.  
- Labour is suffocated by bandwidth theft.  
- Electoral legitimacy and MP safety are eroded.  
- Cross‑party norm restoration becomes nearly impossible.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Not a Normal Opponent  
The alt‑right is an **anti‑institutional project**.  
It seeks to:

- delegitimise elections  
- undermine pluralism  
- normalise conspiratorial thinking  
- frame opponents as enemies, not rivals  

It is not playing by democratic rules.

### 2. Threat to the Conservative Party  
The alt‑right:

- siphons off voters  
- radicalises the base  
- punishes moderation  
- destabilises leadership  
- pushes MPs into hard‑right signalling out of fear  

Result: the party becomes ungovernable from within and unattractive to broader electorates.

### 3. Threat to Labour  
Labour’s challenge is different:

- alt‑right narratives dominate media cycles  
- capacity for structural reform evaporates  
- leadership must constantly rebut bad‑faith accusations  
- efforts at cross‑party repair are framed as weakness or betrayal  

The party is trapped in defensive posture.

### 4. Threat to the Political Class and Public Safety  
Across parties, MPs face:

- intensified threat levels  
- harassment campaigns  
- distorted public perception  
- shrinking safe space for constituent engagement  

The job of being an elected representative becomes materially more dangerous and less attractive.

### 5. Threat to Electoral Legitimacy and Norms  
The alt‑right mainstreams:

- “rigged election” rhetoric  
- contempt for independent institutions  
- delegitimisation of opposition victories  
- demonisation of compromise  

Without trust in the system, outcomes lose authority.

### 6. Shared Firewall, Different Houses  
Labour and the Conservatives do not need a coalition, but they *do* need:

- parallel rejection of alt‑right frames  
- common defence of electoral legitimacy  
- mutual recognition that democracy itself is the shared asset  

Otherwise both become hosts devoured by the same parasite.
