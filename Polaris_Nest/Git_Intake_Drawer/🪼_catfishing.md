# 🪼 Catfishing  
**First created:** 2025-12-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-27  
*Deception by identity performance in digital space — not a crime by name, but rarely neutral.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Catfishing describes the deliberate presentation of a false or borrowed identity in order to manipulate another person.  
In UK law, it is **not a standalone offence**, but a *delivery mechanism* for fraud, coercion, harassment, and sexual harm.

This node exists to clarify **where the law actually bites**, why catfishing is often minimised, and how identity deception functions as containment rather than “mere online drama”.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Identity deception ≠ harmless roleplay  
- Harm is assessed through **intent, gain, repetition, and impact**  
- Frequently mis-framed as “mutual fantasy” rather than asymmetric manipulation  
- Disproportionately affects women, disabled people, migrants, and socially isolated targets

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. What Catfishing *Is*  
Catfishing involves:
- Using another person’s photos, name, or persona  
- Inventing a fictitious identity  
- Or materially misrepresenting key facts (age, gender, location, status)  
**in order to influence another person’s decisions or behaviour**

It is not defined by *medium* (dating apps, social media, email) but by **deceptive identity performance**.

---

### 2. What Catfishing Is *Not*  
- ❌ Mere anonymity  
- ❌ Privacy-preserving pseudonymity  
- ❌ Roleplay with informed consent  
- ❌ One-off misstatements without intent to deceive  

The line is crossed when **consent is engineered through false premises**.

---

### 3. Criminal Law Pathways (UK)  
Catfishing is prosecuted indirectly, most commonly through:

- **Fraud by false representation**  
  When deception is used to obtain money, goods, services, housing, emotional labour, or advantage.

- **Harassment / stalking**  
  When identity deception is sustained, repetitive, or distressing, especially after disengagement.

- **Malicious or improper communications**  
  Where manipulation, threats, or coercive messaging occurs via electronic means.

- **Sexual offences (fact-specific)**  
  Where sexual consent is obtained through deception that is material to the decision to engage.

> ⚠️ Absence of money does **not** equal absence of crime.

---

### 4. Civil Harm & Secondary Victims  
Catfishing often creates **multiple victims**:
- The deceived target  
- The person whose images or identity were used  

Civil routes may include:
- Misuse of private information  
- Harassment  
- Data protection breaches  

These harms are routinely under-recognised because they do not fit legacy crime stereotypes.

---

### 5. Containment Dynamics  
Catfishing functions as containment when it:
- Keeps a target emotionally invested while denying reality  
- Exploits trust asymmetries (gender, disability, immigration status, trauma)  
- Shifts blame onto the deceived party (“you should have known”)  

This mirrors broader systems where **credulity is punished more harshly than deception**.

---

### 6. Why Institutions Struggle With It  
- Law is event-based; catfishing is **process-based**  
- Emotional harm is downgraded compared to financial loss  
- Digital identity is still treated as “less real”  
- Victims are framed as participants rather than targets  

Result: under-charging, non-charging, or misclassification as “relationship issues”.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🎭 Catfishing* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents identity deception as a structural harm vector rather than a novelty internet behaviour.
