*The 1950 VVS Moscow crash and the politics of rebuilding history overnight.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
On 7 January 1950, a Li-2 aircraft carrying nearly the entire Soviet Air Force hockey team crashed in a snowstorm near Sverdlovsk. The team was the creation of Vasily Stalin, son of the General Secretary — a vanity project that fused sport, masculinity, and propaganda. Its destruction was immediately censored. Within days, Vasily ordered a replacement squad assembled before the press could notice.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Censorship in motion:** erasure of disaster as loyalty test.  
- **Sport as ideology:** hockey as proof of Soviet virility.  
- **Instant resurrection:** rebuilding a myth faster than grief could register.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The State’s Team  
VVS Moscow symbolised the militarisation of leisure — athletes as soldiers of prestige. The plane crash punctured that illusion, revealing the fragility of controlled triumph.  

### 2. The Vanishing  
News was suppressed; obituaries forbidden. The dead were replaced before they could be mourned. In this sleight of hand, grief became treasonous and silence patriotic.  

### 3. Afterlife of the Joke  
In *The Death of Stalin* the crash returns as farce — “The whole national team’s dead!” — a line that exposes the absurd rationality of fear. The comedy works because it recognises an enduring logic: in regimes built on control, even tragedy must perform obedience.
