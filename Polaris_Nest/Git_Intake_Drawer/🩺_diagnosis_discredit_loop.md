# 🩺 Diagnosis–Discredit Loop  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Active tactic: inserting or questioning mental-health diagnoses to undermine reliability of testimony.*

---

## 🧭 Overview  

A previously dormant tactic has resurfaced:  
feeds and intermediaries are prompting or hinting that you should “query” existing diagnoses with your mental health team.  

On its face this seems benign. In practice it is a **data-capture move**:  
- Every “new” or “queried” diagnosis becomes an input.  
- Each input then becomes a basis to frame your testimony as unreliable.  

---

## 🌀 Current Position  

- **No emergency:** no clinical change requiring immediate disclosure.  
- **Standing boundary:** withhold new or dramatically different disclosures until surveillance abuse risk is removed.  
- **Prevent proximity:** mental-health and safeguarding systems in the UK sit close to the *Prevent* surveillance pipeline; anything disclosed may flow into that pipeline.  

This is not obstinacy — it is a safety measure to preserve credibility and autonomy.

It records an active containment tactic where mental-health diagnoses are prompted or reshaped to discredit survivor testimony.
