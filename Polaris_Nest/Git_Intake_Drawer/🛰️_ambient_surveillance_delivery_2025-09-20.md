# 🛰️ Ambient Surveillance & Delivery Manipulation — Field Log (2025-09-20)
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20
*Field log documenting user-reported ambient-surveillance vectors (device background audio, Siri-like capture), SIM/eSIM cloning, device mirroring, and logistics manipulation to time deliveries for surveillance or coercion.*

## Factual summary (user-provided)
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20
- **Observation:** User reports plausible method where ambient capture (background audio via voice assistant or app permissions), combined with SIM/eSIM cloning and device mirroring, is used to determine when a target is in a vulnerable state (e.g., in the bath). Malicious actors then manipulate logistics platforms (marketplace, WMS, carrier dispatch, gig-worker apps) to time deliveries precisely for harassment, surveillance, or coercion.
- **Platforms / vectors noted:** voice-assistant ambient capture (Siri/Alexa/Google Assistant), device mirroring, SIM/eSIM cloning, operator UI nudges, WMS/SAP manipulation, carrier dispatch overrides, gig-worker app nudges.
- **Why it matters:** This creates a low-cost, high-specificity operation to observe, harass, or coerce individuals with plausible deniability and deep operational stealth.

## Immediate preservation & mitigation steps (additions to prior checklist)
1. **Capture app permissions & audit**: for affected devices, screenshot and export app permission lists (microphone access, background audio permissions, accessibility services). Note installation timestamps for any suspicious apps.  
2. **Export voice-assistant activity logs**: where possible, request history of voice assistant activations and queries (Apple Siri logs, Google Assistant history, Alexa activity) for time ranges around suspicious events. Preserve these exports and hash them.  
3. **Document SIM/eSIM provisioning**: request provisioning logs from mobile provider for the affected number (dates of eSIM issuance, device bindings, provisioning events).  
4. **Preserve device mirror/backups**: if device mirroring or remote management software is present, capture configuration, connected accounts, and any management or MDM profiles installed.  
5. **Collect timeline linking ambient trigger → delivery event**: for suspicious deliveries, build a timeline showing ambient capture times (if available) and correlating delivery dispatch/pick/arrival times.  
6. **Isolate and image suspect devices**: avoid using devices suspected of compromise; if possible create a forensic image with a specialist to extract microphone logs, background process lists, and installed services.

## Investigatory leads (technical)
- Query assistant providers for activation timestamps and associated device/account identifiers.  
- Ask platforms for API logs that show delivery priority flags or dispatch overrides and correlate to times of ambient triggers.  
- Examine operator device logs for unexpected background app activity or remote-control sessions.  
- Check carrier provisioning records for re-provisioning or cloning events.

## Evidence hygiene
- Record who gathered each artifact, when and how. Produce SHA256 hashes for any exported files. Store originals and working copies separately.
- Treat voice-assistant logs sensitively; they may contain private content. Preserve under encrypted storage and disclose only to vetted investigators or counsel.
