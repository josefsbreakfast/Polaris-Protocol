# 💰 Problem Manufacture — Capitalism as Perpetual Malfunction  
**First created:** 2025-10-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*When dysfunction becomes the product itself.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Examines the late-stage capitalist tendency to **create or prolong crises** that can then be monetised through consumer “solutions.”  
Frames this as an intentional design pattern rather than market accident: exhaustion, scarcity, and “self-improvement” industries depend on continuous malfunction.  
Argues that political and professional classes often sit *above* the perceptual line of these harms, mistaking systemic fatigue for individual failure.

### 2. Psychosomatic Class Dynamics  

Late-capitalist health patterns reveal a **split in visibility**. The ailments most common among the working poor — migraines, back pain, digestive instability, fatigue, anxiety — are routinely coded as *psychosomatic* or *individual* failings. Yet these are often the direct, physical manifestations of structural conditions: insecure housing, impossible schedules, food precarity, and unrelenting stress.  

Because professional and policymaking classes inhabit a different material environment, they often interpret these symptoms as self-inflicted. They have the means to buffer themselves from exposure — private transport, childcare, healthcare, domestic help — so the invisible strain never accumulates. This produces a **feedback loop of disbelief**: the poorer and more overstretched the worker, the less likely their suffering is recognised as real, and the more it is moralised as laziness or poor discipline.  

The result is an enormous hidden economic cost. Days written off as “tummy bugs” or “childcare emergencies” are in fact symptoms of **policy failure**. Universal social policy and reliable access to care would reduce this burden drastically, but such measures are dismissed as too expensive — without accounting for the cost of lost labour, burnout, and medicalisation downstream. The economy thus feeds on the very exhaustion it refuses to name.

#### 🔍 Definition Note — “Psychosomatic” ≠ Imagined  

The term **“psychosomatic”** remains deeply contested.  
In psychiatry and psychosocial medicine, it was originally meant to indicate *interaction* between mental and bodily processes — but in public discourse it has been degraded into a synonym for *not real*. This distortion has allowed policymakers and clinicians to dismiss complex, under-researched physical suffering as emotional weakness.  

In truth, **persistent physical symptoms with apparent mental-health components** are not imaginary; they are signals of how social and biological systems interlock under strain. Entire populations — especially **Black and brown women, migrants, and low-income workers** — are under-represented in the research that would clarify these mechanisms. Their bodies are therefore treated as anomalies, or worse, as untrustworthy narrators of their own pain.  

This absence is not benign neglect.  
Medical history shows the opposite: these bodies have been studied, but *extractively*. From **Henrietta Lacks**, whose cells were taken without consent, to **J. Marion Sims**, who performed surgeries on enslaved Black women without anaesthesia, exploitation has shaped the knowledge base itself. The issue is not invisibility but **colonial visibility** — the gaze that sees only what can be taken, not what must be healed.

### 3. Professional Blind Spots and Moral Distance  

Professional detachment has been mis-sold as objectivity. In practice, it functions as **class insulation**. Those who write policy, run institutions, or model public behaviour rarely inhabit the conditions they regulate. Their vantage point — protected by salary, stable housing, and institutional authority — produces a buffered worldview where deprivation feels abstract.  

The result is a **moral distance disguised as rational governance**. When workers’ problems appear as data points, “efficiency” becomes a euphemism for disbelief. Health policies are designed to manage absenteeism rather than to understand it; social policy targets “behavioural change” rather than structural relief. This translates complex, embodied suffering into performance metrics: compliance rates, productivity indices, “wellness engagement.” The worker’s pain becomes a number to be optimised, not a reality to be reduced.  

This blindness is not purely personal — it is infrastructural. Professional success depends on maintaining confidence that the system broadly works. To acknowledge that the working population is sick because the structure itself is pathogenic would threaten the legitimacy of entire bureaucracies. Thus disbelief becomes a job requirement, a protective membrane between those administering society and those enduring it.

### 4. Colonial Epistemology as Innovation Blockade  

To describe Palestine as a **colonial issue** is not rhetorical excess; it is a recognition of how colonial permission structures still organise global ethics, knowledge, and resource flow. The same logic that allows territorial occupation also underwrites whose pain is considered real, whose data counts as evidence, and whose bodies are available for extraction. Medical research, international law, and technological innovation all remain shadowed by this permission structure.  

When societies tolerate or justify colonial violence, they reproduce an **intellectual containment field**. Critical frameworks such as race theory or decolonial medicine become framed as threats rather than tools. The result is a civilisation that refuses to learn from itself — one that repeats the same patterns of exclusion in every new field, from AI safety to reproductive health.  

To oppose white supremacy, then, is not to indict individuals for their skin colour. It is to **remove the epistemic governor** throttling collective progress. The scientific and creative imagination cannot flourish inside a hierarchy that demands ignorance of the conditions it exploits. A genuine Enlightenment would honour curiosity over comfort — recognising that dismantling colonial logic is not cultural fashion but a prerequisite for human innovation.

### 5. Worker Exhaustion as Revenue Stream  

In the exhaustion economy, fatigue is profitable. Systems are designed to keep populations just functional enough to purchase recovery, but not rested enough to resist. Wellness, caffeine, entertainment, and self-help industries all monetise the gap between depletion and collapse. The cycle is self-funding: austerity strips public provision; private enterprise sells coping mechanisms to fill the void; burnout becomes a lifestyle, not a red flag.  

This economy depends on a **controlled deficit of vitality**. If workers were well — if they had universal healthcare, stable housing, and time to rest — vast sectors of the market would vanish. Thus, exhaustion is not a by-product; it is a managed condition, a behavioural yield extracted from living bodies. Each disrupted sleep pattern, deferred appointment, or skipped meal feeds into the same profit column that records “resilience” as a corporate virtue.  

The result is moral inversion: those who endure sickness and precarity are told they are weak, while those who design the system that produces it are celebrated as innovators. The body becomes the site of both exploitation and denial — the ultimate renewable resource for an economic model that measures success by how much life it can extract without total breakdown.
