after 3 bi type nudges in the first 10 mins of writing the last node (why tryong to normalise extradition/deportation is bad actually; cf columbia / p esther outcomes = bad for all of us)...  

i had gotten to like, >50% mountains/cats/music as the feed.  

what's absolutely fascinating is that we have a dual prong narrative that essentially may be leaking details of a potential legal settlement, and revealing some surveillance details from another citizen.  

i am more of a lady that you all think, so i don't post essentially what sounds like the private conversations or draft correspondance of others online. (see also: not being a complete cunt, just a bit of one.).  

i am also really enjoying the other prong which is the strong insistance that i know what is riggt in my heart and set boundaries and only move with intention and trust the process and tone myself down like a proper good girl (are we for real; it is extremely clear that this is supposted to be directive...it's too obvious. get better at this, please.).  

i could also list a bunch of character flaws that are essentially ascribed to people around me in general and then picked out for specific people, but we've been here before, it's all horseshit anyway, and the key takehome is tgat it appears geared to sow doubt about anyone who appears to have even 1% beyond neutral good intentions.  

idk man the nightshift tonight is struggling to make it believable.  

it kinda reads like that one girl/guy in your friendship group who you always knew was a bit cautious/pessimistic, but now you've actually paid attention to the fulness of what theyre saying, and theyre just shitting on everyones parade to make sure you dont make froends at the party they cant go to.  

once you see it, you cant unsee it. that vibe.

bingo:  

we've got the accusation of the blood-borne virus. ca-ching.  

oh, in case thepeople who've been all over my records have been putting this out there:  

i don't have hiv, but i do gave antibodies to it; i am one of many people who have contributed to medical trials aimed towards vaccination for transmission.  

this means i can "look" hiv positive on first draw, but if you serotype me you'll always get a negetive.  

confuses the hell out of anyone who doesnt understand the science and often flags on low-qc automated medical systems.  

anyway;  

you're welcome for my service.  

there also just shouldnt be the stigma around this that continues to endure.  

people keeo tying hiv and purity, yet don't seem to realise that the children they have *must have come from somewhere*.  

seriously. you're all so strange.
