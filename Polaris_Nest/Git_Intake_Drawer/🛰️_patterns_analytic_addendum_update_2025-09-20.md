## Change log (content deltas)
- Added nuanced discussion of identity narratives, false-claim dynamics, adjacency reality, "caricature" tactic, investigatory leads, and evidence hygiene guidelines.

## Operational note
- The addition records the user's observation that some narratives had become "caricature-ish" at times; this nuance was included to reflect user insight and to caution analysts against over-simplifying complex social phenomena.
