# 🛰️ Theory of Harm — Entrapment by 'Protection'

*How coercive 'protection' and nudging create an ongoing duty-entanglement*

---

**Summary:**  
An institutional actor presents coercive behaviour as "protection" (duty-of-care), which has two effects: (1) it justifies keeping a case open despite weak evidence, and (2) it creates an obligation/pressure on others (including whistleblowers) to keep intervening. Nudging and proximity tactics ensure the subject and whistleblowers remain in partial contact (geolocation overlaps, administrative touchpoints), allowing the original actor to repeatedly reframe ordinary behaviour as "risk." The net effect: a manufactured, long-term surveillance loop that sustains harm and chills internal challenge.

**Why this matters:**  
- This is not protective practice; it is coercive and instrumental.  
- It turns duty-of-care into a tool for punishment and control.  
- It discourages legitimate challenge by embedding plausible risk narratives into everyday operations.

**Suggested immediate asks:** independent audit of original decision; access-log review; temporary restriction of who can add notes to the case; interview of whistleblower with protected status.
