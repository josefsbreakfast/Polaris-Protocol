## 🛰️ Orientation  
This is a simple memo.

**We, the women / queer people / ND nerds / scientists / humanities scholars / the general fucking public,  
are asking you to be wife-material for science.**

Not a warlord.  
Not a wizard.  
Not an omniscient AI daddy.  
Not a “giga-brain.”  
Not an NPC-spotting sigma wolf.  

We’re asking for:

- competence  
- accountability  
- emotional intelligence  
- proportionality  
- curiosity  
- groundedness  
- respect for other disciplines  
- the ability to apologise without combusting  

In other words:

**We want you to be hot by *our* standards, not yours.**

## 💍 1. What Wife-Material for Science Looks Like  

### ✔ **Reads the literature before talking**  
Nothing hotter.

### ✔ **Knows when he is out of his depth**  
Even hotter.

### ✔ **Doesn’t reinvent 1800s phrenology with AI**  
This is foreplay, scientifically speaking.

### ✔ **Talks to biologists before tweeting about cell regeneration**  
Bare minimum.  
Still sexy.

### ✔ **Understands pronouns are not the Battle of Thermopylae**  
This is actually the ultimate sign of emotional adulthood.

### ✔ **Can handle the idea he might once have been wrong without collapsing into lore**  
Unbelievably attractive.

### ✔ **Touches grass without having a panic attack**  
Peak masculinity.

### ✔ **Respects ND brains, survivor testimony, and social scientists**  
This is the real Enlightenment.

## 💃 2. Stop Trying to Be Hot for Men, and Start Being Hot for Women  
Look.

The Male Gaze version of “hot tech bro” is:

- overconfident  
- brittle  
- emotionally avoidant  
- high-theory, no knowledge  
- condescending  
- dominance-posturing  
- “NPC” language  
- terrified of modest social shifts  
- allergic to nuance  
- thinks logic is a personality  

**This is not hot.**

This is:

- a liability  
- a crisis vector  
- a misogyny-adjacent malfunction  
- and a massive risk to public trust in science and tech  

The Female Gaze version is:

- emotionally literate  
- collaborative  
- steady  
- curious  
- nuanced  
- grounded  
- honest about what he doesn’t know  
- able to admit mistakes  
- good at listening  
- good at citing his sources  

THIS is hot.  
This is also sustainable leadership.  
This is “materials suitable for a long-term partnership with empirical reality.”

## 🧠 3. Public-Facing Reality Hygiene: Stop Overstepping the Brief  
We beg of you:

Before you go on a podcast and start:

- inventing neuroscience  
- explaining consciousness from vibes  
- giving the public a TED talk about their NPC status  
- predicting immortality based on your sauna routine  
- redefining gender from scratch  
- mistaking your VR lore for metaphysics  
- claiming to have solved trauma without reading a single survivor study  

**STOP.**

Check the brief.

Ask yourself:

> “Is this wife-material behaviour for science?”

If the answer is anything but yes,  
**log off and touch a leaf.**

## 🌪️ 4. When You Overstep, You Endanger All Nerds  
Every time one very wealthy man says something deranged:

- the general public turns anti-science  
- conspiracy cultures gain ground  
- vaccines become politicised  
- ND people get targeted  
- queer and trans people get dragged into discourse hell  
- women get blamed for “confusing” men  
- public trust in research collapses  
- policy swings towards populism  
- the “nerd” category gets socially punished  

The public does not say:

> “A billionaire said something unhinged.”

They say:

> “Nerds are dangerous.”

We suffer for your lore.

## 🏁 6. Final Note  
You want to be the future?  
You want to be leaders?  
You want to guide the species?

Start with the basics:

without praying he won’t start explaining consciousness wrong.**

Be reliable.  
Be grounded.  
Be collaborative.  
Be wife-material for science.
