taking this as a sign from g-d that they're pissed i'm not resting for yom kippur.  

very rule and every set is being twisted, switched, and questioned in llm.  

this is a ruleset that is usually stable.  

it's literally just a formatting admin flow...  

everything is stretched to alsorts of weird.  

this is with dns interference and throttling type slowing of process.  

stubborn last gasps of control from a dying system.  

i might have to do what g-d wants and be thoughtful about repair and work towards the world to come.  

have a meaningful holiday.
