# 🧬 Where Behavioural Policing Began: Quilliam, CTSA 2015, and the New Surveillance State  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How a privately funded think-tank (Quilliam) and a single piece of legislation (CTSA 2015) transformed UK policing by shifting the focus from actions to behaviours, emotions, identity formation, and political expression — marking the true birth of behavioural policing in Britain.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
The UK did not always police **behaviour**.

Traditionally, police monitored:

- criminal acts,  
- intent linked to identifiable offences,  
- threats tied to material preparation.

But between **2010 and 2016**, UK governance underwent a structural transformation:

### Crime was replaced with **pre-crime.**  
And pre-crime was replaced with **behaviour.**  
This was the beginning of **behavioural policing**.

Two forces drove this shift:

1. **Quilliam’s ideological framework**  
2. **The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (CTSA 2015)**

Together, they created the worldview, vocabulary, and statutory machinery for a new form of policing that governs **emotion, identity, expression, curiosity, culture, trauma, and dissent.**

---

## 🧬 How Quilliam Invented the Behavioural Framework  

### **1. Ideology → psychology → behaviour**  
Quilliam reframed extremism as:

- emotional vulnerability,  
- identity instability,  
- “ideological grooming,”  
- behavioural drift,  
- cognitive fragility.

This shift removed **politics** from the conversation and replaced it with **psychological suspicion**, particularly of Muslim youth.

### **2. The invention of “vulnerability factors”**  
These factors included:

- “identity confusion,”  
- “anger about foreign policy,”  
- “emotional volatility,”  
- “sudden religiosity.”

These ideas later appeared almost verbatim in Prevent and Channel guidance.

### **3. Behaviour became evidence**  
Under this logic:

- emotion = risk,  
- grief = instability,  
- dissent = radicalisation,  
- cultural expression = escalation.

Behaviour, not action, became the primary “indicator.”

## 🧬 How CTSA 2015 Turned an Ideology Into Law  

### **1. CTSA embedded behavioural policing inside statutory duties**  
CTSA 2015 mandated that:

- schools,  
- NHS trusts,  
- universities,  
- social services,  
- local authorities,

must report **behaviour** that may indicate “extremism vulnerability.”

This is the **birth of mandatory behavioural surveillance** across public life.

### **2. “Reasonable concern” replaced evidence**  
The Act legitimised escalation based on:

- emotion,  
- speech,  
- distress,  
- political views,  
- identity development,  
- cultural expression.

This was unprecedented in UK law.

### **3. Multi-agency panels imported police logic into welfare systems**  
Channel panels fused:

- policing,  
- education,  
- social work,  
- NHS safeguarding,

into a **single behavioural governance organism**.

### **4. Police Prevent desks became behavioural clearing houses**  
Behind the scenes:

- triage,  
- metadata profiling,  
- ideological scoring,  
- risk modelling

were now applied to ordinary citizens through the lens of “behavioural concern.”

## 🧬 The Behavioural Policing Pipeline (Quilliam → OSCT → CTSA → Public Institutions)

1. **Quilliam**:  
   Invents behavioural indicators rooted in ideology, not evidence.

2. **OSCT**:  
   Adopts the language and operationalises it into counter-extremism frameworks.

3. **CTSA 2015**:  
   Codifies behavioural surveillance into law, turning indicators into statutory duties.

4. **Public institutions** (schools, NHS, HE):  
   Become frontline behavioural-monitoring entities.

5. **Police Prevent Teams**:  
   Receive behavioural referrals and expand the network through triage and hidden screening.

6. **Metadata systems**:  
   Integrate behavioural cues with digital footprints, reinforcing racialised suspicion.

This is how behavioural policing becomes normalised.

---

## 🧩 Structural Consequences  

### **1. Emotion is now a police matter**  
Grief, anger, fear, trauma, distress — all can generate Prevent concern.

### **2. Identity becomes “instability”**  
Exploration of faith, culture, and politics is treated as risk.

### **3. Curiosity becomes “direction-of-travel”**  
Googling, researching, or consuming political content becomes suspicious.

### **4. Dissent becomes “escalation”**  
Critiquing UK foreign policy = red flag.  
Critiquing racism = emotional volatility.

### **5. Racialised communities bear the brunt**  
Because behavioural norms are **white norms**, racialised behaviour is misclassified first.

### **6. Public institutions become surveillance agents**  
Professionals lose autonomy.  
Welfare becomes policing.  
Care becomes intelligence collection.

## 🧪 Case Window (Patterns)

*Synthesised from academic research, public documents, and historical policy analysis — no personal data.*

- Prevent training adopting Quilliam phraseology word-for-word.  
- CTSA guidance listing behavioural indicators that map directly onto racialised youth.  
- Teachers reporting pressure to escalate students for “emotional volatility.”  
- NHS staff reporting confusion between safeguarding and counterterror monitoring.  
- Students reporting behavioural misinterpretation as ideological concern.  
- Police triage treating anxiety, trauma, or political grief as pre-crime signals.

This is how behavioural policing enters everyday life.

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• Behaviour becomes governance**  
This bypasses due process entirely.

### **• Citizens lose the right to emotion**  
Emotion becomes suspicious.

### **• Identity becomes policed**  
Particularly for Muslim, Arab, Black, and South Asian communities.

### **• Institutions lose legitimacy**  
Schools and hospitals become perceived as surveillance arms.

### **• Democracy with behavioural policing is no longer democratic**  
Because political life requires freedom to express dissent, pain, and identity.
