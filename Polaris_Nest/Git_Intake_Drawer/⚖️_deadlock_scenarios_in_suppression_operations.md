*Mapping institutional behaviours when disclosure is blocked, partial, or hostile.*

## 1. Full Refusal  
- Claim no data held.  
- Risks: unchecked suppression, impunity.  
- Leverage: FOI/SAR chasers, non-response logs, whistleblower intake.  

---

## 2. Partial Disclosure  
- Admit holdings but curate releases.  
- Risks: false impression of transparency, distraction.  
- Leverage: cross-compare partials, triangulate with testimony, expose omissions.  

---

## 3. Hostile Disclosure  
- Data weaponised via leaks, smears, timing.  
- Risks: survivor discrediting, narrative hijack.  
- Leverage: prove manipulation, pattern hostile timing, pre-anchor survivor testimony.

## Pattern  
Deadlock isn‚Äôt technical but political: refusal, partials, and hostile spins all sustain stalemate.
