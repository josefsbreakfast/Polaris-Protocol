## 🛰️ Orientation  
A forensic-satirical genealogy of purity culture, tracing how moral control of the body became the algorithmic masculinity meme we now call *No Nut / No Fap November*.

## 🌩️ Timeline of Purity and Power  

| Era | Movement / Figures | Notes |   
|------|------------------|-------|  
| 1307 | **Knights Templar** | “Demonology of Debt”: Philip IV cancels his arrears by declaring bankers heretics. |  
| 1500–1700 | Reformation / Witch Hunts | Body discipline = salvation economy; female appetite coded as threat. |  
| 1800s | Jahn (1810s), Schreber (1850s), Beecher (1840s) | Discipline → purity → energy logic enters education and gymnastics. |  
| 1890–1930 | Macfadden (1902), Theosophy / Golden Dawn (1890s) | Vitalism and Orientalist mysticism merge: semen as life currency. |  
| 1930–1950 | Reich (1942 *The Function of the Orgasm*) | Sexual energy as political force; state repression as energy block. |  
| 1950–1990 | Fitness & Clean-Living culture | Purity becomes leisure; consumer asceticism as status. |  
| 2000s – 2010s | 4chan → Reddit | Diffusion → Forum cross-pollination; abstinence challenge as masculine discipline. |  
| 2020s | Algorithmic Masculinity | Apps monetise shame loops; “self-mastery” = engagement metric. |

## 🧿 Analysis  
- **Debt → Sin → Discipline** — Moralise scarcity to justify control.  
- **Vital Energy → Purity → Efficiency** — Fascist metaphysics reborn as productivity culture.  
- **Algorithmic Aura** — Platform logic recodes post-orgasmic guilt as data-driven self-improvement.  

Short references: (Macfadden 1902), (Reich 1942), (Beecher 1846), (Jahn 1810s), (Schreber 1850s), (Golden Dawn 1897).

*🪩 No Fap Fascism* is a living node of the **#PolarisProtocol**.  
It maps how centuries of discipline ideology condensed into a viral challenge and why reclaiming bodily comfort and pleasure is an act of de-fascisation.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
