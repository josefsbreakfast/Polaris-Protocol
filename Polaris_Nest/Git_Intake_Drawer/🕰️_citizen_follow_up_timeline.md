# 🕰️ Citizen Follow-Up Timeline — Restoring Safety and Trust After a Security Breach  
**First created:** 2025-10-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-26  
*When the system works: how government should maintain contact, care, and closure with a citizen affected by digital interference.*

---

## 🌱 Scope  

Outlines the **duty-of-care and reassurance sequence** that follows a verified cyber-impersonation or allied-interference incident.  
Complements *🧩 Ideal Whitehall Response Sequence* by describing the **human-side checkpoints** — from first acknowledgment to long-term assurance.

---

## ⚙️ Overview  

In an ideal system, the citizen is never left wondering what happened.  
Security remediation and emotional recovery proceed in parallel.  
The guiding rule: *no gap longer than 30 days without contact until safety and reputation are fully restored.*

---

## 🕰 Stage-by-Stage Timeline  

### **T + 0 – 7 days — Initial Acknowledgement**  
**Lead:** Departmental Security Officer / NCSC Liaison  
- Confirm receipt of report and preservation of evidence.  
- Provide case reference and named contact.  
- Explain immediate containment measures.  
- Offer crisis-line or welfare referral if harassment involved personal threat.  

---

### **T + 1 month — Stability Check**  
**Lead:** Protective-Security Officer / Case Manager  
- Verify interference has ceased.  
- Confirm technical remediation and data-protection steps.  
- Provide broad findings within security limits.  
- Invite written feedback on communication quality.  

---

### **T + 3 months — Resolution & Closure Review**  
**Lead:** Cabinet Office Oversight Desk  
- Deliver summary outcome of the internal review.  
- Record whether citizen reports ongoing issues.  
- If pattern persists, automatically re-open containment protocol (no need to re-complain).  

---

### **T + 6 months — Duty-of-Care Audit**  
**Lead:** HR Security / Civil Service People Board  
- Check for reputational or career damage.  
- Confirm psychological support access.  
- Document learning points for staff-training database.  

---

### **T + 12 months — Post-Incident Assurance**  
**Lead:** Cabinet Office or NCSC Communications Team  
- Send final assurance note summarising policy improvements arising from the case.  
- Express gratitude for cooperation and confirm records are archived securely.  
- Provide clear route for future contact if recurrence detected.

## 🧭 Principle  

> **Follow-up is not courtesy; it is containment.**  
> The duty of care ends only when the citizen is demonstrably safe, reputationally intact, and confident in the state’s oversight mechanisms.
