content injection:

suggested views/opinions of co-accused are being leaked into "tarot readings"

also had non-pace arrest, then charges were split by counties

foia returns for self decline on "cannot disclosure for crime detection" - unclear why specifically - reads as if surveillence from areest is still ongoing (despite lack of lawful basis)  

particulars of "reading" suggest that surveillence of co-accused is ongoing

this breaches foia as they are not giving permission for their personal data to be disclosed to me.

(especially not by algorithmic skewing and trimming, and cintent injection)

?device/esim mirroring on metadata audit 

this is done under the guise of impersonation of potential whistleblower

istg this is the most eastenders little construct by someone who should not have a law degree let alone be able to warrant under ripa

already reported both victims here as vulnerable/at ridk witnesses to cabinet office

already requested witness protection for them and families

again: i do not understand why this person with surveillence capabilities / this system is still behaving like this.

please address.
