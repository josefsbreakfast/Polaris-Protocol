# 🧼 Courtier Class in the Age of Austerity  
**First created:** 2025-11-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-04  
*How opportunism became a governance ecology.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
In post-austerity and post-pandemic governance, expertise drained faster than institutions could adapt.  
What filled the vacuum was not competence but *proximity*: people who survive by existing near decision-making, rather than by doing it.  
This node maps how that ecology formed — an environment where flattery becomes infrastructure.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Proximity as capital.** Presence replaces track record.  
- **Institutional amnesia.** When no one remembers the last policy, anyone can “invent” it again.  
- **Survival through mirroring.** Mimicry of authority reads as authority.  
- **Collapse aesthetics.** The performance of governance replaces governance itself.  
- **Loyalty arbitrage.** The appearance of stability becomes a tradable asset.
