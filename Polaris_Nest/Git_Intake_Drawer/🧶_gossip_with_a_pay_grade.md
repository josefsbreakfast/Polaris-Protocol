# 🧶 Politics Is Just Gossip With a Pay Grade  
**First created:** 2025-11-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*How everyday gossip scales up into the machinery of governance.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node starts from an everyday truth: “politics” is just what people do to each other all the time, only better paid and better dressed.  
When power, pay, and responsibility misalign, gossip turns executive.  
The same mechanisms that shape village hierarchies or workplace cliques—favour-trading, selective visibility, etiquette, and plausible deniability—become policy once money and prestige attach to them.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Containment in miniature:** the rota, the rumour, the closed-door meeting.  
- **Gendered translation:** women’s “gossip” becomes men’s “policy.”  
- **Wage-politics link:** “keep politics out of work” = “accept the current pay gradient.”  
- **Village logic scaled up:** influence networks, old boys, old aunties—same circuit, different suits.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  
Politics doesn’t begin in Parliament; it begins wherever decisions distribute comfort and cost.  
The workplace is already political because the terms of work *are* policy—just privately implemented.  
When nurses, cleaners, carers, or techs complain about overwork and underpay, they’re not “bringing politics into it”; they’re naming the politics that was already there.  

The paradox: informal power feels apolitical to those who hold it.  
A senior consultant’s offhand remark becomes policy as surely as a grandmother’s gossip becomes social law.  
Both enforce norms, assign shame, and allocate attention.
