# 🩻 2018–2022 — The Era of Structural Revelation

## 🛰️ Orientation  
If **2010–2017** was *The Long Fuse*,  
**2018–2022** was the moment the dynamite finally lit in the public mind.

Not because new predators emerged —  
but because the population **finally understood the pattern**.

This was the era when society realised:

### ✔ The predators were never alone  
### ✔ The institutions were never neutral  
### ✔ The scandals were never isolated  
### ✔ The cover-ups were never accidental  

This period created a **global loss of faith** in elite systems.

Suspicion = baseline.  
People expect further revelations.
