# 🧩 Great Replacement as Multigroup Elimination Myth  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How the Great Replacement Theory coordinates eliminationist logic across Muslims, Black communities, Jews, and queer people.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node frames Great Replacement Theory as a **convergence myth**: a single narrative enabling multiple genocidal fantasies.  
It assigns Muslims as the demographic threat, Black people as the cultural threat, queer/trans people as the moral threat, and Jews as the imagined masterminds.

---

## 🧩 Structural Outline  

### 1. Origin of the Myth  
- From Renaud Camus to global far-right adoption  
- Civilisational angst repackaged as demography

### 2. Allocation of Blame  
- Muslims → invasion panic  
- Black communities → cultural collapse panic  
- LGBTQ+ → moral decay panic  
- Jews → conspiracy panic (“puppet masters”)

### 3. Why It Works  
- Simple structure  
- High emotional charge  
- Connects racism + antisemitism + homophobia

### 4. Political Consequences  
- Policy hardening  
- Surveillance expansion  
- Violence against migrants, Muslims, queer people  
- Neo-fascist community bonding
