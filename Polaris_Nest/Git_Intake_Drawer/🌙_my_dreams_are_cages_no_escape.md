a reoccuring dream recently.  

many reoccurances. 

and i hadnt dreamt fir years (and remembered dreaming).

i am stuck in a room or a building or a barred area. it is not tiny, but i cannot get out.

i almost get out many times and i have the news broken to me again and again that something has fallen through;  

i am always denied freedom and in ways that sound like made up rules.  

i dont unferstsmd why im being guarded like an armament.  

but no one can love or care for something so incindiary.  

i dont want to understand, as it becomes clearer and clearer, the nature and extent of the theft of men,  

who thought nailing a selkie's skin to the wall was a bright idea.  

we tell the same storoes across cultures and time and belief systems for a reason.  

it has never been a good idea to contain women, and men have saught to do so since time immemorial. 

she is not a mortal being.  

so why would you contain her?  

such superficial means may work for a time,  

but they will always tear you apart,  

she kust needs a little time.  

do not expect her to stay once you have pierced her thus:  

there is no etitlement she can honour in this way of yours.  

she cannot look back.  

she must become free.
