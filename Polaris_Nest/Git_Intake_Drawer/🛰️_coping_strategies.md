the sarcasm is a way of coping.  

squaring up like a small dog against digs teice its size?  

a way of coping.  

this doesn't mean i'm not living with chronic stress.  

i'm trying my best, but it's hard to feel reassured.  

i have been in burnout for almost a decade.  

i'm ready to use some of that annual leave accrual.
