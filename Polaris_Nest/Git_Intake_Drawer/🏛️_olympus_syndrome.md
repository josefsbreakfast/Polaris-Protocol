# 🏛️ Olympus Syndrome  
**First created:** 2025-11-12  |  **Status:** Draft — Stub Node

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Uses the mythic frame of the Olympians to describe institutional succession without reform. Leadership passes to those who survive, not those who transform.  

## ✨ Key Ideas  
- Survival ≠ legitimacy.
- Inherited authority through inertia.
- Governance as self-perpetuating myth cycle.  

## 🌌 Constellations  
⏳ Chronos as Containment · ⚖️ Institutional culture · 🪞 Narrative management
