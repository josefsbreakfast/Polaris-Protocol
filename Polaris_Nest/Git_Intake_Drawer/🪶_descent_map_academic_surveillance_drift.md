# 🪶 Descent Map — Academic Surveillance Drift
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*Tracing how an early academic programme of “monitoring internet usage” descended into policy, procurement, campus practice, and everyday surveillance narratives.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
This node traces the *descent* of an academic idea (early-2010s research on digital traces and radicalisation risk) as it migrated from research outputs into policy vocab, procurement asks, vendor products, and campus operational practice. The focus is not origin-genealogy but the pathways and mechanisms of adoption, translation, and normalisation.

## 🪜 Descent pathway (high level)
1. **Emission (2010–2012)** — Academic research programmes and conference presentations (concept: digital trace signals → radicalisation risk).  
2. **Policy docking (2012–2016)** — Think-tanks, Home Office science notes, and advisory groups reuse the research; framing shifts to “early-warning”/safeguarding.  
3. **Middleware step (2015–2019)** — Security/edTech vendors productise trend analytics and keyword-flagging for campus Wi-Fi / proxy stacks.  
4. **Soft mandates (2017–2022)** — Audits, KPI expectations, or funding/risk-management pressures make monitoring a de facto requirement.  
5. **Practice drift (2020–2025)** — Trend dashboards, triage flows, and pre-referral habit formation normalise campus surveillance.  
6. **Counter-mutations (ongoing)** — Civil-society pushback, academic critique, DPIAs, legal test cases, and student union resistance.

## Evidence slots (fill when you have docs)
- **Emission** — [Ref-E01] (paper/talk: title | author | year) — key claim & earliest citation trail.  
- **Policy** — [Ref-P01] (policy note / think-tank memo / Home Office document) — quote showing rhetorical shift.  
- **Vendor** — [Ref-V01] (vendor brochure / tender spec) — screenshots or procurement entries.  
- **Procurement / FOI** — [Ref-FOI01] (contract, invoice, DPIA excerpt).  
- **Operational** — [Ref-OP01] (IT policy doc, escalation flow, audit checklist fragment).

> Use the “Evidence slots” to populate the timeline and annotate each hop. Keep single-line provenance notes for each ref.

Analytic lenses / questions
	•	Language laundering: which phrases enabled the shift from academic research to “duty of care”?
	•	Incentive vectors: who benefits institutional-politically from adopting monitoring (insurers, auditors, reputational actors)?
	•	Technical affordances: what logs/telemetry were needed to make this practical for a campus IT team?
	•	Opacity points: where in the pipeline is auditability weakest (vendor code, data brokers, DPIAs)?
	•	Social impact: how did normalisation change student conduct, self-censorship, and staff practice?

Method notes (do not include operational detail)
	•	Use FOI/SAR/DPIA & procurement searches to fill evidence slots.
	•	Avoid publishing raw sensitive logs or operational vulnerabilities — annotate with redacted quotes and contract metadata only.
