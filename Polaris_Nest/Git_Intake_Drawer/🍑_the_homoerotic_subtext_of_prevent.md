## 🏳️‍🌈 Orientation  
Let’s be honest:

> **Prevent is 40% Islamophobia, 40% misogyny, 20% straight men panicking because they fancy other men.**

We are focusing on the last one.

Because when a straight man says:

- “He’s charismatic in a concerning way,”  
- “He makes certain people uncomfortable,”  
- “He has an intensity I can’t explain,”  
- “He influences vulnerable people,”  

what he actually means is:

> **“I would let him rearrange my ribs,  
>  and this threatens my heterosexual brand.”**

# 👮 Why This Turns Into Prevent  
Because Prevent is the **official government-approved method™**  
for dealing with:

- repressed bisexuality,  
- jealousy,  
- social inferiority panic,  
- rage that pretty people exist,  
- and prophecy-level thirst.

White men can’t say:

> “He is hot and I am spiralling.”

The whole thing would be far too adjacent to having feelings, complexity, or indeed, a personality.  

So they say:

> “He poses a safeguarding concern.”

# 🏳️‍🌈 Pinkwashing Edition  
Straight white men who “support gay rights” to justify genocide are truly saying:  

> **“I like the aesthetics of uniformed military men  
>    and need a progressive alibi for my thirst.”**  

It is not support.  
It is **homoerotic colonial cosplay**.

# 🎭 Serious Takeaway (Hidden at the bottom like a moral lesson)  
These jokes rest on a real truth:  

> **Male jealousy + repressed desire → risk vocabulary → Prevent/Channel misuse.**  

Which is why this belongs in Digital Disruption *and* the serious cluster.
