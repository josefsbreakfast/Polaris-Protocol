idk maybe other people are also speaking up because today?  

many strange foia emails  

many, many disconnects when working on polaris.  

getting annoying and very slow.  

i'm vaguely sick (idk something viral; high covid here) so i'm working very alowly today.)  

i'm quite emotionally raw from the experience of being locked-in this plastic surveillance box.  


it feels like a freak show in the 1910s and trust me...  

it is nice to imagine that you don't need to cover yourself every time an iot item is in the room.  

to say it has played up my "i fear getting undressed because of what happened when i was a child" would be to put it mildly.  

this should not be normalised.  

you want barbarism?  

it is doing this to your citizenry.
