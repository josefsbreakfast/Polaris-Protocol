*How economic alignment with authoritarian regimes creates systemic blind spots and accelerates fascist capture*

## Core Thesis  
Capitalism, as an economic system, is structurally agnostic: it prioritises profit over rights or  
ideology. When left without checks and balances, capital naturally seeks the easiest partnerships —  
often with authoritarian actors who promise stability, order, and deregulation.  

This dynamic produces a **structural appeasement loop**:  
- Economic elites normalise authoritarianism because it serves their bottom line.  
- Authoritarians gain legitimacy and resources, entrenching their power.  
- Counter-extremism frameworks underplay the danger, because the rhetoric of “stability” mirrors  
  conservative social values.

## Mechanisms of Appeasement  
1. **Profit Alignment** – Capital rewards deregulation and suppression of labour.  
2. **Narrative Camouflage** – Authoritarian actors speak the language of security, order, and growth.  
3. **Blind Spot Creation** – Shared vocabulary disarms scrutiny from centre-right observers.  
4. **Accelerant Effect** – Once in power, authoritarian regimes are easier business partners than  
   pluralist democracies.

## Historical Context and Limits of Appeasement  

It is important to note that appeasement did not arise from naivety alone. In the 1930s, European 
leaders were confronting something they had never fully seen before: a regime combining industrial 
capacity, mass propaganda, and totalitarian control at scale. Although authoritarian empires had 
existed earlier, the **Third Reich’s expansionist model** represented a new and unsettling hybrid.  

Appeasement had rational appeal. After the carnage of the First World War, economic recovery and 
social stability were fragile. Many saw appeasement as a way to “buy time” and avoid repeating 
1914–1918. And for centuries prior, European powers had often **projected violence outward** — the 
Crusades being one example — to prevent genocidal conflicts on the continent itself. Against that 
backdrop, the Nazi project looked novel, disruptive, and difficult to diagnose.  

Yet the economic benefits of appeasement proved catastrophically short-term. By enabling German 
rearmament and industrial expansion, the UK and France allowed a rival to amass devastating military 
capacity. Britain’s trading power, already strained, suffered lasting consequences:  
- The British Raj was lost within a decade.  
- Colonial dominance in North Africa and the Middle East was challenged and eroded.  
- The empire as a whole was irreversibly weakened.  

Thus, while appeasement offered momentary economic relief, it **accelerated Britain’s imperial 
decline** and left the country decimated in the Second World War.

## Asymmetry of Recognition  

Western publics and institutions are primed to recognise authoritarian expansion when it comes from 
traditional adversaries. For example, Russia’s incremental seizures of territory under Putin are 
widely understood as precursors to larger conquest. This diagnostic lens — identifying small bites 
as a signal of wider appetite — is accurate and useful.  

Yet the same pattern often goes unrecognised when enacted by **Western governments, corporations, or 
allied states**. When the behaviour comes from “our side,” it is reframed as pragmatic, defensive, 
or economically necessary. This asymmetry blinds us to authoritarian consolidation inside our own 
systems.  

Appeasement today is not only about failing to confront hostile powers abroad — it is also about 
failing to name and resist authoritarian behaviours **within friendly regimes or our own political 
class**. Recognition must therefore be behaviour-centred, not adversary-centred.

## Strategic Implications  
- **Hearts-and-minds appeals fail**: For actors motivated by profit, moral persuasion is irrelevant.  
- **Anti-fascist strategy must name capital**: Avoiding the economic dimension leaves movements  
  perpetually on the back foot.  
- **International precedent**: 1930s appeasement shows that early concessions feed fascist growth.  
  Today’s digital economy speeds this cycle.
