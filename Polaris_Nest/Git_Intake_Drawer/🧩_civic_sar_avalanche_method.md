# 🧩 Civic SAR Avalanche Method  
**First created:** 2025-11-22  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*A distributed, lawful stress-test for breached and opaque vendors.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node describes how coordinated **Subject Access Requests (SARs)** can function as a **civic-scale enforcement loop** against large data processors — especially those embedded deep in state infrastructure (e.g. Capita, CGI, Sopra Steria).

Each SAR is just one person exercising a statutory right.  
At scale, they become an **avalanche**: forcing vendors to admit processing, disclose sub-processors, identify breaches, and confront the cost of non-notification.

Polaris treats this as a **mass-participation audit tool** — a way for the public to enforce rights that regulators and controllers have failed to uphold.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Lawful by design** — based on individual rights under UK GDPR / DPA 2018.  
- **Distributed load** — many small requests, not one giant one.  
- **Breach exposure** — compels vendors to acknowledge who was affected.  
- **Vendor cost realignment** — makes proactive notification cheaper than avoidance.  
- **Meta-data harvest** — patterns in replies reveal hidden data flows.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1  Why an “avalanche”?  
After a major breach (e.g. large-scale pension data compromised via a contractor), the vendor is supposed to:

- notify affected data subjects “without undue delay”  
- cooperate with controllers and regulators  
- tighten security and documentation  

In practice, many stall, minimise, or hope the incident disappears.

A **SAR avalanche** changes the economics:  
- If thousands of individuals each demand full disclosure,  
- If delays generate ICO complaints, parliamentary questions, and press scrutiny,  
then *non-disclosure* becomes costlier than facing the breach honestly.

---

### 2  Anatomy of a civic SAR avalanche  

1. **Shared template** — a clear, rights-based SAR text, freely available.  
2. **Individual action** — each person sends their own SAR (email/post/portal).  
3. **Public logging** — a simple spreadsheet or repo tracking: sent date, acknowledgement, reply, non-compliance.  
4. **Pattern analysis** — identify scripted evasions, conflicts, inconsistencies.  
5. **Escalation bundle** — compile evidence packs for ICO, MPs, journalists, unions, survivor groups.  

The avalanche is not about “breaking” a company.  
It is about forcing **truthful accounting** of what they hold, who they share it with, and how they’ve failed.

### 3  Template SAR for breached vendors  

> **Subject:** Subject Access Request – Processing of my data under public-sector contracts  
>   
> Dear [Vendor],  
>   
> I am making a request under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.  
>   
> Please confirm whether you process, or have processed, any of my personal data under contracts with UK public bodies (including but not limited to [list likely bodies: e.g. my local council, my pension fund, MoD, DWP, NHS]).  
>   
> If so, please provide:  
> - all personal data, metadata, logs, and derived analytical profiles relating to me;  
> - the purposes for which each category of data is or was processed;  
> - the source of each category of data;  
> - the identity of all recipients or categories of recipient (including sub-processors);  
> - any automated decision-making or profiling applied;  
> - the applicable retention periods;  
> - whether any of my data has been affected by a personal data breach, and if so, details of the breach.  
>   
> Please also confirm whether any of my personal data has been used for system testing, model development, or service optimisation outside the original contractual purpose.  
>   
> Kind regards,  
> [Name]  
> [Identifiers needed to locate data – e.g. NI number, pension ref, postcode]

### 4  Response patterns and what they mean  

Common replies and their interpretations:

- **“We act only as processor”**  
  → check FOI/DPIA: if vendor sets means/ends or reuses data, they are more than a pure processor.  

- **“Your request is excessive”**  
  → often used to deter; note volume but remind them systemic risk isn’t your responsibility.  

- **“We cannot identify you”**  
  → if you’ve provided multiple identifiers, this may indicate weak data governance or stalling.  

- **“No breach involving your data”**  
  → cross-check with public breach statements; contradictions become evidence packs.  

Capture these responses in a common log. The avalanche isn’t just SARs — it’s the **dataset of evasions**.

---

### 5  Tactical safeguards  

To keep the avalanche lawful and defensible:

- **No spam** — one SAR per person, per vendor, unless genuinely updated.  
- **Tone** — factual, courteous, rights-based; no threats.  
- **Safety first** — participants don’t share their responses publicly in full; only patterns, redactions, and meta-data.  
- **Inclusivity** — provide easy “how-to” guides for people with low digital literacy.  
- **Care** — acknowledge that reading your own data in this way can be distressing; signpost support.  

The method is assertive but not abusive. Power comes from numbers, not cruelty.

---

### 6  When to trigger an avalanche  

Trigger conditions might include:

- vendor admits a large breach but does not proactively notify likely affected people  
- credible leaks suggest more extensive processing than disclosed  
- repeated FOI/SAR evasion patterns across institutions  
- systemic entanglement (e.g. a single vendor across pensions, benefits, health, justice)  

Use cautiously. The goal is **targeted, time-bound action**, not permanent siege.

*🧩 Civic SAR Avalanche Method* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It describes how coordinated, lawful SARs can be used as a public enforcement tool against opaque or breached vendors, shifting the cost of non-disclosure back onto those who mishandled the data.
