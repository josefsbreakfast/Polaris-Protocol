# 👾 PREVENT & Escalatory Harm in Economic Crisis  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How austerity, cost-of-living strain, and public-service collapse increase the frequency and severity of PREVENT misfires.*

## Orientation
This note explains how economic stress and public-sector fragility amplify PREVENT’s harms. When living conditions deteriorate, people show more distress, and institutions become more anxious about risk. These conditions make PREVENT more reactive, more subjective, and more punitive. The result is a cycle where poverty, instability, and institutional panic produce escalations that have nothing to do with actual extremism.

## Key Features
- Economic crises increase visible distress, anger, and instability.
- Overstretched services escalate more because they fear liability.
- Staff under strain rely on templates instead of context.
- PREVENT misfires more when poverty increases.

## Economic stress as a behavioural amplifier
During a cost-of-living crisis, people display more:
- irritability
- emotional volatility
- fear
- shutdown
- sleep disruption
- hypervigilance
- conflict spillover
These are normal reactions to instability. PREVENT frameworks, however, treat behavioural shifts as potential early indicators of radicalisation, making economic distress a functional risk multiplier.

## Institutional panic under austerity
Austerity reduces staffing, training, and time. When institutions fear complaints, oversight failures, or missed warning signs, they default to over-escalation. PREVENT becomes a catch-all for behaviour that staff can’t contextualise due to lack of capacity. “Better safe than sorry” becomes a coping mechanism rather than a safeguarding strategy.

## Why misreads increase
- Staff lack time to build rapport.
- Distress looks like risk under pressure.
- ND traits become harder to recognise.
- Emotional expression becomes less tolerated.
- Institutional fear becomes the dominant logic.
PREVENT thrives in environments where fear replaces clarity.

## Escalation as harm recycling
Economic strain also increases contact with health, housing, welfare, or social-care systems. Each of these systems is fragile. When distress enters multiple services simultaneously, it accumulates interpretation errors. A minor concern in one setting becomes a justification for escalation in another. PREVENT absorbs the accumulated noise.

## Why certain groups are hit hardest
During crises, the following groups are more likely to be misinterpreted:
- low-income individuals
- racialised communities
- autistic and ADHD adults
- women absorbing emotional labour
- the chronically ill
- people in unsafe housing
- victims of coercive control
These groups already show distress and frustration. Economic stress magnifies these signals and makes them more visible to staff who are themselves under strain.

## Feedback loop between poverty and scrutiny
Poverty increases emotional expression.
Emotional expression increases staff discomfort.
Staff discomfort triggers PREVENT escalation.
PREVENT escalation worsens instability.
Instability deepens poverty.
This creates a reinforcing loop where living conditions and scrutiny become mutually amplifying.

## Systemic consequences
PREVENT loses legitimacy when it becomes a mechanism for managing the fallout of economic collapse. Genuine safeguarding signals drown in a sea of poverty-driven “concerns.” Communities lose trust in institutions. Systems become more defensive, not more effective.

## Why this matters
If PREVENT is to serve any constructive role, it cannot absorb the ambient distress created by a national economic crisis. Understanding escalation patterns in collapsing services is essential for reform and for protecting vulnerable individuals from harm disguised as safeguarding.
