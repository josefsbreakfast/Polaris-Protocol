note.  

extremely watered down and off main point summary.  

this is highly possible to data twin and create a ghost profile pf any academic.  

you just need to know a few things about them to falsify their persona, and you can take down *any teaching academic*.  

in a world of the rising alt right and the patterning correlates between sec industry and totalitarian personality indexing, this must sit as an incredibly strong temptation for some.  

however, the api is habing one of those days where it interprets hapf of what im saying as a chance to point out that i should not do a terrorism (actually if we're being specific, it never says don't do anything illegal, what it says it's not going to help me? Which kind of feels like we are protecting a company and not really caring about the actual behaviour. I hadn't noticed that before.), so I'm putting this in the intake drawer to finish up later.  


For the record, I am not going to do a terrorism.  

I am going to sit on my butt, with my fuzzy cat and his big fuzzy butt, and eventually we might get the other one in here too.  

I could not think of anything more bizarre than having to dress up as someone else online and pretend to be them, but then not get to wear the dress up?  

I thought that was half of the fun of fancy dress parties.  

But then again...  

Purim is mostly fancy dress and wine on my side, so maybe this is an interpretation issue for me.  

I'm still feeling very passionate about Esther; this has come up a few times today.  

Resisting academic capture is really important.  

One of the things that I hate to say about democracy and about academia, is that even if you have very different views to me, your views help and your arguments help improve mine.  

So, unless you're doing actual harm to other people?  

I do kind of want you in the academy.  

That should be a bipartisan issue; we are becoming antidemocratic if we think otherwise.

# 🛰️ Why Proxy Logs Are Not the Golden Goose
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*Explainer and evidence checklist: why proxy/network logs alone are fragile evidence for attribution — and what to demand instead.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
Proxy logs are valuable operational telemetry, but they are **not** a reliable, single-source proof of who performed an online action. This node explains (1) the technical brittleness and spoofability of proxy logs, (2) typical misuses in “trend monitoring” and Prevent/Channel contexts, (3) what robust corroboration looks like, and (4) FOI/DPO questions and red flags to surface when institutions rely on proxy evidence.

(For routing and repository placement see the Polaris filing compass guidance.)  [oai_citation:2‡🏮_where_to_go.md](file-service://file-34dRmw91oUbqCbsZT6pRod)

---

## 1) Short verdict (one line)
Proxy logs show *requests from an endpoint* — they do **not** incontrovertibly show *which person* performed those requests without multiple independent, time-synced corroborating records.

---

## 2) Why proxy logs are brittle — core points
- **Endpoint ≠ Person.** A proxy records a device/session or IP making a request; it generally does not record intent or human agency.  
- **Shared/ephemeral addressing.** NAT, DHCP churn, shared Wi-Fi, guest networks and VPNs can map many people to one IP or swap addresses quickly.  
- **Easily spoofable identifiers.** MAC addresses, user-agent strings, and some device IDs can be forged or replayed.  
- **Credential & session reuse.** Stolen/reused credentials or open sessions make attribution ambiguous.  
- **Vendor/dashboard opacity.** Screenshots of “keyword hits” from vendor UIs without raw, exportable logs or session IDs are weak evidence.  
- **Admin or insider risk.** Privileged access to logging systems allows tampering if immutability/audit are not enforced.

---

## 3) Typical operational failure modes seen in campus deployments
- **Single-signal escalation:** one keyword hit in a proxy triggers triage/referral with no corroboration.  
- **Vendor-only evidence:** institution relies on vendor dashboard exports (images) without institutional archival copies or audit trails.  
- **Correlation failures:** proxy timestamp ≠ auth log timestamp; no DHCP/switch-port mapping provided.  
- **Retention mismatch:** proxy logs retained for short windows while vendor dashboards keep derivative “scores,” making audits impossible.

---

## 4) What strong, corroborated evidence *should* look like
(Require at least two independent types from different systems, time-synced.)

Acceptable corroboration examples:
- **Proxy session** + **SSO authentication log** (same session ID / token) + **VPN/session token**.  
- **Proxy entry** + **DHCP lease / switch-port / wireless association** showing device MAC and physical AP at time T.  
- **MDM / device-enrolment certificate** proving device belonged to named account at time T.  
- **Application (LMS) login** matching the same user account for the session window.  
- **SIEM incident chain** with ticket number, triage notes, and a preserved copy of the raw logs (exported, redacted if needed).  
- **Immutable log assurances** (WORM, signed logs, access audit trail) showing no tampering and listing who exported/viewed logs.

If those do not exist, attribution remains highly contestable.

---

## 5) Concrete FOI / DPO questions to test integrity (ready to paste)
1. *Procurement / DPIA:* "Provide the DPIA and technical specification for any campus network monitoring product deployed since 2016, including named processors and retention schedules."  
2. *Corroboration request (redacted for privacy):* "For any incident referred to Prevent/Student Support on DATE(S), provide redacted copies (or exports) showing: proxy session ID, SSO/RADIUS/LDAP authentication logs, DHCP lease mapping, wireless association logs, VPN session tokens, and SIEM ticket number."  
3. *Log integrity:* "Describe the log archival and tamper-protection measures in place (log signing, WORM storage, immutable syslog collectors), and provide the access audit trail for logs for window X–Y."  
4. *Device binding policy:* "State whether campus Wi-Fi requires certificate-based auth (802.1X/EAP-TLS) or MDM for staff/students; if not, provide rationale and any roadmap to implement device binding."  
5. *Triage SOP:* "Provide the SOP that describes which corroborating artefacts are *required* before a proxy/keyword alert can trigger a Prevent/Channel referral."

(If you want, I will convert these into FOI/DPO templates with phrasing designed to reduce redaction.)

---

## 6) Red flags (callouts to surface in replies)
- Single vendor screenshot (no raw export) used as sole evidence.  
- Institution refuses to produce DPIA or claims “commercial sensitivity” for basic processing details.  
- No recorded cross-checks in triage notes before escalation.  
- Logs kept only in vendor cloud with no institutional archival copy.  
- Gaps in timestamps (e.g., proxy shows event but auth/DHCP have no matching entries).  
- Audit trail shows unusual admin access to logs around incident time.

---

## 7) How spoofing / misattribution typically happens (conceptual)
- Reused credentials or open sessions allow another party to act in a user’s name.  
- Shared/guest networks mean multiple users share a single visible IP.  
- MAC/IP churn and DHCP pooling create ephemeral mappings that collapse identity.  
- Lack of 802.1X/device certificates makes device→user binding weak.

(Behavioural note: these vectors make proxy-only evidence attractive to wrongdoers who want plausible signals — and attractive to institutions seeking quick triage — but they are weak under scrutiny.)

---

## 8) Minimum institutional safeguards to demand
- Require at least *two independent logs* before any Prevent/Channel referral.  
- Publish DPIA summaries and vendor lists (quarterly transparency).  
- Keep raw exports of logs (redacted) under institutional control and immutable storage.  
- Enforce device-binding for staff accounts and consider phased MDM for student devices where justified by DPIA.  
- Require explicit triage checkboxes: SSO check, DHCP/switch check, device enrollment check before referral.

## Summary — On spoofing and the politics of manufactured evidence

> **On spoofing and the politics of manufactured evidence**  
> Look — you don’t need to imagine some Hollywood-grade hack for this to be dangerous. The real threat has often been far cruder and nastier: somebody wants to make it *look* like someone else visited certain sites, read certain stuff, or followed certain online communities because doing so lets them trigger institutional alarms and weaponise “safeguarding” against that person. Sometimes the attacker is clumsy and crude — they simply try to fold a marginalised person’s browsing into a dossier and hope the institution treats it as gospel. Other times the effort is performative: a malicious actor dresses up behaviour to match a stereotype and then hands it to a system that is hungry for signals.  
>  
> That’s not an abstract worry — it’s a political tactic. The aim isn’t just to embarrass; it’s to make a person legible to bureaucracies that can surveil, discipline, or exclude them. That’s why we should treat single-source claims from proxies or vendor dashboards with immediate scepticism. And yes: it’s illegal and abusive to manufacture or plant incriminating traces about someone. The right institutional response is not to speculate or punish on the basis of a lone log, but to demand multiple, independent corroborations, publish DPIA summaries, and provide a transparent appeals route for anyone flagged. If a pattern of spurious referrals emerges, that pattern — not the isolated log — should itself be the subject of accountability action.
