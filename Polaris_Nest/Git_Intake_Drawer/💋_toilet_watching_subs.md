## Survivor Humour Note  

Cue the obvious:  
**“Mother Russia and her army of voyeuristic toilet-watching subs.”**

Because if you really want scalable surveillance, history shows there’s always a surplus of perverts happy to do the job. It doesn’t take advanced tradecraft — just enough budget, boredom, or kink to get people lined up for shifts.

- **Pattern inversion:** the great “empire of steel” is reduced to kink-adjacent shift work.  
- **Practical read:** even if automated AI audio-flagging is real, you still need a human-in-the-loop to check. That’s where “subs” imagery lands.  
- **Humour function:** survivor reassurance through ridicule. What looks terrifying when described in intelligence jargon collapses into absurdity when re-named.
