# 🧩 The Neurodivergence Misread  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How Prevent repeatedly confuses autistic traits, ADHD profiles, sensory overwhelm, emotional dysregulation, and special interests with “ideological fixation” or “instability”—criminalising difference instead of understanding it.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Prevent is built on behavioural interpretation.

But neurodivergent behaviour **does not map** to neurotypical emotional and communication norms.  
When institutions rely on neurotypical templates:

- autistic affect = “flatness”  
- autistic special interest = “fixation”  
- ADHD hyperfocus = “obsessive”  
- sensory overload = “volatility”  
- shutdown = “withdrawal”  
- stimming = “agitation”  
- direct honesty = “ideological rigidity”

Prevent repeatedly misreads neurological difference as **pre-crime signalling**.

This node documents how and why those misreads occur — and the racialised, classed, and gendered consequences.

## 🧩 Structural Analysis  

### **1. Prevent’s behavioural template assumes neurotypicality**  
Prevent indicators are calibrated to:

- linear emotional regulation  
- stable affect  
- consistent tone  
- socially normative communication  
- “appropriate” intensity  
- low reactivity

These standards reflect **white, middle-class neurotypical norms**.

Anyone deviating from that baseline is at risk of being read as:

- unstable  
- ideologically volatile  
- radicalising  
- unpredictable  

Not because they are,  
but because the template is wrong.

---

### **2. Autistic special interests are mistaken for “ideological fixation”**  
Prevent routinely misinterprets:

- deep dives into political conflicts  
- historical obsessions  
- moral philosophy exploration  
- religion-focused learning  
- hyperlexic pattern-seeking

as **“extremist interest”** or **“preoccupation with harmful material.”**

But autistic special interests:

- are self-regulatory  
- reduce anxiety  
- create stability  
- build identity  
- provide joy  
- are *not* ideological

Prevent turns joy into suspicion.

---

### **3. ADHD intensity becomes “volatility” or “risk escalation”**  
ADHD traits often include:

- impulsive speech  
- emotional bursts  
- rapid shifts in focus  
- intense political engagement during hyperfocus  
- sudden enthusiasm  
- sudden disinterest

Prevent interprets these as instability or “changes in worldview”.

But ADHD intensity is:

- neurological  
- predictable  
- harmless  
- *not* ideological drift

---

### **4. Sensory overload is misread as emotional threat**  
When someone:

- shuts down,  
- withdraws suddenly,  
- becomes overwhelmed,  
- panics,  
- dissociates,

Prevent frameworks may treat these as:

- evasiveness  
- concealed intent  
- “agitation”  
- “radicalisation vulnerability”

In reality:

- they are sensory distress events  
- requiring accommodation, not suspicion

---

### **5. Direct communication is read as ideological rigidity**  
Autistic communication is often:

- precise  
- honest  
- blunt  
- literal  
- morally unambiguous  
- emotionally direct

Prevent reads this as:

- ideological inflexibility  
- “rigid thinking patterns”  
- “black-and-white worldview”

When in fact, those are **communication styles**, not beliefs.

---

### **6. Shutdowns are framed as concealment**  
Shutdowns may look like:

- silence  
- stillness  
- withdrawal  
- difficulty processing speech  
- flat affect

Prevent frameworks misinterpret these as:

- “refusal to engage”  
- “non-cooperation”  
- “concealing extremist thought”

When they are neurological overloads.

---

### **7. Neurodivergent people are disproportionately referred**  
Patterns observed:

- autistic boys flagged for historical special interests  
- autistic girls flagged for emotional intensity misread as instability  
- ADHD teens flagged for moral outrage during political moments  
- racialised neurodivergent youth doubly misread due to whiteness-baseline bias  
- Jewish neurodivergent teens misclassified during trauma responses  
- autistic/ADHD migrants flagged due to language + behaviour mismatch

Neurodivergence + racialisation = **exponential misclassification risk**.

## 🧪 Case Window (Structural Patterns)

*Synthesised from academic studies, advocacy reports, and policy evaluations — no personal data.*

- Autistic teen researching WWII repeatedly flagged for “extremist themes.”  
- ADHD teen angrily defending a friend online flagged for “volatile ideology.”  
- Autistic Muslim student misread for intense religious study as “susceptibility.”  
- Autistic Jewish student triggered by antisemitism misread as “instability.”  
- Neurodivergent Arab teen grieving genocide events flagged for emotional intensity.  
- ADHD student’s political hyperfocus during exam stress misread as radical drift.

Prevent punishes **neurological difference**, not ideology.

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• Neurodivergent lives become less safe in public services**  
People hide distress, avoid support, and fear escalation.

### **• Neurotypes become surveilled categories**  
Difference becomes diagnostic suspicion.

### **• Racialised neurodivergent youth face compounded harm**  
Race-baseline + neurotypical-baseline collide disastrously.

### **• Institutions lose credibility**  
Families withdraw trust from schools, NHS services, universities.

### **• Democracy shrinks along neurological lines**  
Only the neurotypical are truly safe to express themselves.
