tbh im not sure i should have to be fighting to even evade the jailbreaking of the tools i use to write, in order to get to either ico or ipt clearence, when we all know i should be giving evidence at subcommittee level.  

reminder that it's only arrogance when you can't back it up.  

just lots a lot like profiteering off human trafficking to me,  

when you don't do due diligence for the modern slavery component.
