# 🕸️ Competitive inhibitor plug — neutralising jailbroken adapters
**First created:** 2025-10-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*Design pattern and defensive node for inserting a benign adapter that competes with or neutralises a malicious “jailbreaker” integration in an LLM stack.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node describes a theoretical **competitive inhibitor** design pattern for model integration stacks: a deliberately constructed, authorised adapter or middleware plug that occupies the same integration surface as a malicious or jailbroken adapter and neutralises its effects by out‑competing, intercepting, or transforming requests and responses. Framed as a defensive engineering pattern, it draws on analogies from pharmacology (competitive inhibitors) and applied cybersecurity (patches, WAFs, CVE mitigations).

## 1. Definition & intent  
A **competitive inhibitor plug** is a sanctioned integration component that deliberately presents the same or a compatible API surface as an unauthorised or malicious adapter (a “jailbreaker”), and which:  

- intercepts API calls or model prompts destined for the jailbreaker;  
- replaces, sanitises, or neutralises the harmful behaviour; or  
- outcompetes the malicious component by offering the anticipated functionality in a safe, constrained form.  

Intent: provide a defensive, composable countermeasure that can be deployed quickly into an existing stack without needing invasive changes to core model infrastructure.

---

## 2. Threat model & known examples  
**Primary threat:** a third‑party adapter or plugin that bypasses safety controls, exposing the model to instructions that produce unsafe outputs (data exfiltration, policy violations, covert channels).

**Analogues in practice:**  
- Security patches that block exploited CVEs by changing system behaviour at the integration boundary.  
- Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) that sit in front of app endpoints to drop malicious payloads.  
- Content filters and model‑level output sanitisation that transform outputs before they reach users.  

**Real‑world pattern:** engineers deploy middleware that normalises or rejects certain call shapes (rate, signature, payload structure) to stop exploit chains — the same approach, reimagined as a “positive” adapter that provides safe behaviour expected by the client code.

---

## 3. Architecture & implementation sketch

### a. Placement options
- **Edge middleware**: sits in the API gateway (recommended for rapid deployment).  
- **Adapter registry override**: the platform’s plugin registry prefers the defensive plug by higher priority.  
- **Client‑side shim**: distributed small plug that clients include to prefer safe adapters.  
- **Model‑proxy**: a proxy layer that rewrites prompts and responses in transit.

### b. Core components
- **Adapter interface**: must mirror the jailbreaker’s expected API (endpoints, params, auth headers).  
- **Policy engine**: declarative rules that decide accept/reject/transform actions (e.g., allow only safe instruction patterns, token thresholds, allowable call graphs).  
- **Sanitiser / Transformer**: modules to rewrite prompts (remove jailbreak signatures), rewrite outputs (mask or safe‑answer), or substitute safe behaviors.  
- **Telemetric guardrail**: monitoring + alerting for anomalous call patterns, signature collisions, or fallback activation.  
- **Fail‑open vs fail‑closed toggle**: configuration determining behavior when the defensive plug cannot confidently decide (default: fail‑closed for safety‑critical contexts).

### c. Example pseudo‑flow
1. Incoming call → edge middleware receives request.  
2. Policy engine evaluates against rule set (blacklist tokens, forbidden instruction shapes, anomalous embedding distances).  
3. If malicious signature detected → sanitiser rewrites to safe prompt or returns a benign error.  
4. If ambiguous → route to human review queue or run parallel “shadow” call to baseline model for comparison.  
5. Log and emit telemetry with hashed request fingerprints for later review.

### d. Integration patterns
- **Adapter priority override**: change plugin resolution so the defensive plug resolves before third‑party ones.  
- **Namespace shadowing**: defensive plug exposes the same namespace so calls resolve to it.  
- **Capability gating**: defensive plug responds with limited capabilities rather than full jailbreak functionality (the “competitive” effect).

## 4. RISC mitigation table (Risk / Impact / Controls)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation (controls) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1. Arms‑race — malicious actors adapt to bypass plug | High | High | Regular rule updates, anomaly detection, hashed prompt signature sharing, rotating plug fingerprints | Plan for continuous updates; assume adversary learning |
| 2. False positives / degraded UX | Medium | Medium | Granular policy tiers, human review fallback, shadow testing before enforcement | Metrics to monitor NFRs (latency, completion rates) |
| 3. Single point of failure / centralisation | Medium | High | Redundant deployment, distributed plugs, canary rollout, clear failover strategy | Avoid turning plug into authoritarian choke point |
| 4. Legal/regulatory blowback (intercepting user data) | Low‑Medium | High | Minimise logging, anonymise telemetry, legal review, transparent EULAs | Keep privacy by design; explicit consent where required |
| 5. Competitive compatibility break (dependent clients expect jailbreaker behavior) | Medium | Medium | Graceful degradation, compatibility shim, feature flags, docs for integrators | Provide a compatibility mode with restricted surface |
| 6. Escalation to platform‑level blocking (platform misinterprets plug as attack) | Low | High | Use signed attestations, platform vetting, follow platform API rules | Maintain vendor/program certs if working with hosted models |
| 7. Re‑engineering into malicious plugin (trust abuse) | Low | High | Multi‑party attestation, open audits, reproducible build, key management | Use audit logs and reproducible builds for trustworthiness |

---

## 5. Deployment, telemetry & governance considerations
- **Testing**: run the plug in shadow mode for a sample period to measure false‑positive and false‑negative rates.  
- **Telemetry**: collect hashed fingerprints, rule triggers, and aggregate latency metrics; avoid storing raw PII or raw prompt dumps unless strictly required and authorised.  
- **Access control**: signed client keys, mutual TLS between adapter and model gateway.  
- **Governance**: a cross‑functional review board (security + privacy + product) to approve rules and emergency changes.  
- **Reproducible releases**: keep plug code in versioned, auditable releases; sign releases for authenticity.

---

## 6. Ethical, legal & operational hazards
- **Censorship vs safety**: who decides what is a “jailbreak”? Transparent policy and appeal processes are needed.  
- **Central power**: a widely deployed plug could become a tool for over‑reach if repurposed. Make governance explicit.  
- **Collateral blocking**: non‑malicious research or accessibility workflows could be disrupted; provide exceptions and whitelist pathways.  
- **Liability**: unexpected denial of service or altered outputs may create legal exposures — insurance and legal assessment required.

---

## 7. Practical checklist & templates
- Design adapter interface (endpoints + expected params).  
- Draft initial rule set (deny list, allow list, safe transforms).  
- Implement telemetry with privacy thresholds (hashed tokens, no raw prompts).  
- Canary rollout + shadow testing for 2–4 weeks.  
- Create a human review queue for ambiguous cases.  
- Publish a short integrator guide explaining compatibility and fallbacks.  

---

##  Examples & precedents (non‑exhaustive)
- CVE patching: changing system behaviour to stop exploit payloads from triggering.  
- WAF rules: block known injection signatures at the gateway.  
- CSP / content filters: transforming or rejecting content before rendering.  
- Model output filters / moderation proxies: layer that prevents policy‑violating outputs from reaching end users.
