# 🧿 Did the UK Learn from the Troubles?

*Assessing whether lessons claimed were lessons internalised.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node evaluates whether contemporary UK governance reflects genuine learning from the Troubles, or whether similar failure modes persist under new terminology.

## 🧿 Analysis  

### The Claimed Lesson  
Post-Troubles, the UK asserts it learned that:
- Security-first governance escalates conflict  
- Custodial deaths radicalise rather than deter  
- Secrecy corrodes legitimacy  
- Rights violations linger historically  

### The Observable Pattern  
When faced with political protest today, the state again shows:
- Narrative hardening  
- Oversight avoidance  
- Medical authority overridden by security logic  
- Acceptance of preventable harm  

This suggests **procedural memory without moral integration**.

### Learning vs. Rebranding  
Learning changes thresholds.  
Rebranding changes language.

If the same decision logic appears — merely updated with “extremism,” “risk management,” or “operational necessity” — then the lesson was not learned. It was deferred.

### Why This Matters  
Historical reckoning depends not just on apology, but on **changed behaviour under pressure**. Continuity in failure undermines claims of rupture.
