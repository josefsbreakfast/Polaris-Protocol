# 🛰️ FOI–SAR Dual Audit Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-11-22  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*A twin-lever civic method for tracing state–vendor data flows and exposing containment architecture.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This protocol describes how the public can use **FOI** (to the state) and **SAR** (to private vendors) as a **single, paired audit instrument**.  
Where FOI reveals *what government says it is doing*, SAR reveals *what vendors are actually doing* — and the discrepancy between the two is where containment structures appear.

Polaris treats this as a **forensic civic tool**: a way for survivors, researchers, and communities to map hidden infrastructures of governance, especially where data is outsourced, privatised, or captured.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Twin pressure points** — FOI for the public body; SAR for every named or suspected vendor.  
- **Discrepancy mapping** — cross-compare answers to reveal missing DPIAs, secret sub-processors, and capture gaps.  
- **Vendor chain illumination** — SAR exposes sub-contractors government never discloses.  
- **Legitimacy test** — a system that cannot tolerate FOI+SAR is not operating democratically.  
- **Field-ready wording** — phrasing designed to bypass common exemptions.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1  Why FOI and SAR must be paired  
Used alone, FOI shows **policy theatre**; SAR shows **data reality**.  
Together, they disclose where democratic oversight has been replaced by procurement shields, NDAs, or private data regimes.

FOI → reveals controllers, frameworks, DPIAs, procurement trails.  
SAR → reveals processing categories, data sources, recipients, retention, and breaches.

Where the two contradict, **capture** is occurring.

### 2  The FOI Workflow (state-facing)

**Ask for:**
- contracts, service descriptions, SLAs  
- DPIAs + ROPAs (Records of Processing Activities)  
- vendor lists + sub-processor registers  
- risk assessments and red-team reports  
- minutes of vendor steering groups  
- any “data-sharing gateway” memos  

**FOI phrases built to resist exemptions:**
> “I request the *full and unredacted* Data Protection Impact Assessment, unless specific sections trigger a valid and proportionate exemption. Please cite each exemption applied *per redaction* as required by the FOI Code of Practice.”

> “Please provide the complete list of third-party processors and sub-processors engaged under this contract, including any entities whose involvement is governed by commercial confidentiality.”

---

### 3  The SAR Workflow (vendor-facing)

**Ask for:**
- all personal data processed about you  
- the purpose of each processing activity  
- data sources — where they got it  
- recipients — where they sent it  
- retention schedule  
- any automated decision-making applied  
- any known or suspected breaches  

**SAR phrase that forces full disclosure:**
> “Please provide all personal data, metadata, logs, and derived analytical profiles relating to me that you process under contracts with UK public bodies, including but not limited to [CPS/MoJ/Home Office/local authority]. Please include data obtained via sub-processors or technical logs.”

If they reply “we only act as a processor,” you reply:
> “Please provide the contractual documentation demonstrating that you act solely as processor, including the identity of all joint controllers, and confirm whether any of my data has been used for testing, model development, or service optimisation.”

This forces them to reveal relationships **not disclosed by government**.

---

### 4  Discrepancy Mapping  
The heart of the protocol is the **matrix**:

| Question | FOI answer | SAR answer | Interpretation |
|---------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Do they list identical vendors? | No | Yes | Hidden vendor engagement → likely capture |
| Do DPIAs match vendor processing claims? | Partial | Detailed | State downplaying scope |
| Are sub-processors disclosed? | Rarely | Usually | Evidence of procurement obscurity |
| Are breaches admitted? | Sometimes | Often | Vendor is the real source of risk |
| Who defines the algorithm or risk score? | “Internal team” | “Vendor evaluation stack” | Outsourced decision-making |

Any mismatch = **containment signal**.

---

### 5  Common FOI/SAR Evasion Patterns  
- “Commercial sensitivity” → used to hide political risk.  
- “Processor only” → used to avoid breach liability.  
- “We do not hold this” → used to mask shared databases.  
- “Excessive request” → used to chill public inquiry.  

Document each evasive tactic: evasion is data.

### 6  Field-Ready FOI+SAR Bundle (short form)

**FOI (to public body):**  
> “Please provide all contracts, DPIAs, and sub-processor lists for the digital systems used to process, store, or analyse my data, directly or indirectly, including any vendor-led testing or optimisation.”

**SAR (to vendor):**  
> “Please provide all personal data processed under any public-sector contract relating to me, including data held by sub-processors or derived models.”

This pair exposes almost every structural blind spot in modern governance.
