# 🧪 Adversary Playbook: Twinning Outliers  
**First created:** 2025-09-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-07  

This note describes how an adversary would identify and pair (“twin”) outlier individuals so that their testimonies neutralise each other.

## How targets are found (what “odd data configurations” look like)
1. **Unusual metadata trails** — fragmented digital presence; multiple identities; inconsistent records across institutions.  
2. **Family/historical anomalies** — archival mismatches (service records, migration/duplicate IDs, diaspora overlaps).  
3. **Cross-domain roles** — individuals straddling fields bureaucracies don’t ordinarily map together (e.g., academic–activist, clinician–artist).  
4. **Data gaps/scraped oddities** — interference patterns, illegal scraping footprints, SAR/FOI silences that are themselves anomalous.  
5. **Narrative ‘noise’** — personal/family stories easy to caricature as quirky, biased, or delusional.

## Pairing logic
- **Complementarity:** Find two people whose anomalies “mirror” each other so that each can be used to undercut the other.  
- **Cancellation-by-design:** Ensure officials are pushed into a “both-sides” posture: *contested, therefore inconclusive*.  
- **Reputational containment:** Pre-seed narratives that reframe testimony as bias, fixation, or harassment.

## Who might be affected (illustrative estimate)
Assumptions (documented in the CSV):  
- UK adults (18+): ~53,000,000 (rounded).  
- Prevalence of “odd configurations” (*p*): Low 0.2%, Base 0.6%, High 1.5%.  
- Share of those actively targeted (*t*): Low 10%, Base 30%, High 60%.  
- Probability of being successfully paired (*q*): Low 1%, Base 5%, High 10%.  

Under these **illustrative** assumptions:
- **Low:** ~{LOW_INDIV} people end up in twinned pairs (~{LOW_PAIRS} pairs).  
- **Base:** ~{BASE_INDIV} people end up in twinned pairs (~{BASE_PAIRS} pairs).  
- **High:** ~{HIGH_INDIV} people end up in twinned pairs (~{HIGH_PAIRS} pairs).  

> These numbers are rough order-of-magnitude guides, not measurements. They show how small rates can still yield **thousands to hundreds of thousands** of affected people in a large population.

See also the accompanying table (`uk_twinned_estimates.csv`) and chart (`uk_twinned_estimates.png`).

## Mitigations
- **Cross-jurisdictional reconstruction by default** (treat anomalies as triggers for multi-domain review).  
- **Protected testimony channels** for cross-domain witnesses (insulate against reputational neutralisation).  
- **Counter-twinning audits:** explicitly look for mirrored anomalies, not just individual outliers.  
- **Provenance-first adjudication:** weight chain-of-custody over anecdote.
