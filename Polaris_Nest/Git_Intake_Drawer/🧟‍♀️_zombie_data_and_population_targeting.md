# 🧟‍♀️ Zombie Data and Population Targeting  
**First created:** 2025-10-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*How dormant datasets keep governing the living.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Defines **zombification** as an operating condition of UK governance: records that are no longer “active” yet never die.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- Data-lifecycle architecture across UKSV/Home Office/HE partners  
- Cohort logic replacing individual oversight  
- Equality-law blind spots in algorithmic profiling  
- Behavioural routing as quiet containment  
- Seven-layer analysis with survivor register

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1) Data Lifecycle Architecture  
Ingress → Exemption → Linkage → Persistence.  

### 2) Behavioural Routing (Choice Architecture)  
Placement nudges (funding, programme fit, “supportive environment”) steer subjects where monitoring and capture are easier.

### 3) Cohort Zombification  
Once a **risk group** is modelled, every member’s metadata moves as a school of fish.

### 4) Legal Paradoxes  
Equality Act 2010 s.149 vs DPA 2018 Part 3/4 → lawful bias.

### 5) Recourse Choke Points  
ICO, IPT, JR → cross-blindness.  

### 6) Survivor Register (Phenomenology)  
Patterned coincidence, administrative elasticity, soft containment, ambient probation.  

### 7) Comparative Analogues  
Welfare, education, health echo patterns.
