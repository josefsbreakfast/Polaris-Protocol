# 📦 Containment as Industry  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-16  
*How border enforcement, asylum backlogs, and detention are turned into revenue streams*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Migration “crises” are not accidental.  
- They are manufactured and sustained because **delay and deterrence create profit**.  
- Asylum seekers become units in a managed industry: booked into hotels, surveilled, processed, outsourced.  

---

## Mechanisms of the Containment Industry  

### 1. **Deliberate Backlogs**  
- Average wait for asylum decision: **400+ days** (2024).  
- Slow processing drives hotel occupancy, longer contracts, and more “containment” capacity.  
- Quick processing would be cheaper — but would shrink the market.  

### 2. **Hotel & Detention Contracts**  
- Over **£3bn/year** spent on asylum accommodation (2023–24).  
- Contracts with Serco, Mears, Clearsprings dominate the market.  
- Hotels are often poor quality, but profit margins are high.  

### 3. **Surveillance & Security**  
- Border Force patrols, drones, barges, private escorts (Capita/Tascor).  
- Costs borne by taxpayers, revenue captured by contractors.  
- Expansion is justified by “chaos” headlines.  

### 4. **Containment as Punishment**  
- Hotels and barges designed to deter through discomfort.  
- But deterrence also ensures long stays, which sustain contracts.  
- Misery becomes a profit-making condition.  

### 5. **Externalised Costs**  
- Illness, trauma, and long-term integration failures are not contractor liabilities.  
- If asylum seekers get sick or develop PTSD, the costs fall on the NHS, councils, or families — not on Serco, Clearsprings, or Mears.  
- Contractors simply absorb health hazards (mould, Legionella, infestations) as business risk:  
  - If it’s cheaper to remediate, they will.  
  - If it’s cheaper to lose a license or wait for re-award, they will.  
- Containment is designed as *short-term profit + long-term social loss*.

## Why This Matters  
- Containment logic flips public service on its head: the “problem” must never be solved.  
- The more unsafe and hostile the process, the more revenue opportunities are created.  
- This mirrors other outsourced sectors (care homes, prisons, probation): public dependency is monetised.  

---

## Counterarguments & Rebuttals  
- “It’s just inefficiency.” → No: the inefficiency is profitable, and thus sustained.  
- “It’s about security.” → If security were the aim, fast decisions and safe visas would reduce risk. Current design maximises exposure, not safety.

*Containment as Industry* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how migration policy has been converted into a revenue stream, with structural incentives to prolong backlog and hardship.
