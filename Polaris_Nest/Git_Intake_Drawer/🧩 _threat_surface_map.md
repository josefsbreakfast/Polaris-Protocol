# 🧩 Threat Surface Map  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*A conceptual map of the surfaces through which hostile actors attempt misinterpretation or interference — without tactics, and without assuming capability.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
A **threat surface** is any location where a hostile actor’s projections, distortions, or attempts to weaponise a system *might* intersect with a survivor’s public work.

This node does **not** describe operational methods, and it does **not** predict danger.  
Instead, it offers a **bird’s-eye conceptual map** of:

- possible misinterpretation sites  
- narrative friction points  
- institutional misunderstanding risks  
- emotional escalation vectors  
- administrative noise surfaces  

It models **psychological and bureaucratic patterns**, not technical exploitation.

---

## 🧩 The Six-Class Surface Model  
Polaris recognises six conceptual surfaces where misinterpretation or projection may land.

These surfaces reflect **the hostile actor’s internal state**, not the survivor’s behaviour.

---

## 1️⃣ **Narrative Surfaces**  
Where meaning is assigned to something neutral.

Examples of surfaces:
- tone  
- humour  
- civic framing  
- boundaries  
- survivor testimony  
- autonomy gains  
- public visibility  

Misuse pattern:  
**reframing clarity as chaos**,  
**reframing autonomy as impropriety**.

Anchoring defence:  
documentation, calm tone, consistent narrative architecture.

---

## 2️⃣ **Emotional Surfaces**  
Where the hostile actor reacts to their own feelings, then attributes them outward.

Emotional surfaces include:
- survivor success  
- survivor independence  
- survivor being witnessed by others  
- survivor refusing access  

Misuse pattern:  
projection, shame-driven narratives, sexualised reinterpretation.

Anchoring defence:  
anti-parasocial boundaries, non-sexual framing.

---

## 3️⃣ **Administrative Surfaces**  
Where bureaucratic systems can be nudged, misunderstood, or mis-signalled.

Surfaces include:
- benefits thresholds  
- compliance misunderstandings  
- safeguarding language  
- registry/PO Box visibility  
- bureaucratic ambiguity  

Misuse pattern:  
attempting to use systems as pressure tools.

Anchoring defence:  
transparent logs, declaration commitments, itemised registers.

---

## 4️⃣ **Reputational Surfaces**  
Where third parties receive interpretations of your behaviour.

Surfaces include:
- colleagues  
- institutional peers  
- informal networks  
- “professional concern” narratives  

Misuse pattern:  
gossip, sexualised distortions, undermining competence.

Anchoring defence:  
governance tone, house-style consistency, non-chaotic presentation.

---

## 5️⃣ **Behavioural Surfaces**  
Where others observe inconsistencies or escalations — often from the hostile actor, not the survivor.

Surfaces include:
- boundary violations  
- emotional leakage  
- fixation  
- inappropriate domain interest  
- contradictory claims  

Polaris principle:  
**Behavioural patterns reveal the hostile actor, not the survivor.**

---

## 6️⃣ **Digital Surfaces**  
Not surveillance —  
but **ambient data exhaust** that reflects emotional states through friction.

Surfaces include:
- scroll patterns  
- dwell time  
- error-correction loops  
- app-switch spikes  
- hesitations  

Misuse pattern:  
None — hostile actors have no operational vector here.

Interpretive principle:  
**Emotional activation leaks through behaviour, not because anyone is watching, but because that is the physics of interacting with devices.**

---

## 🧭 Putting It Together  
The threat surface map is not a risk report.  
It is a **conceptual diagram** showing how:

- projection  
- shame  
- entitlement  
- narrative distortion  
- and control-loss reactions  

intersect with:

- institutional perception  
- governance structures  
- public transparency  
- survivor sovereignty  

This map shows **where distortions might land** —  
not that they will land,  
and certainly not that they carry weight.

---

## 🛡️ Why This Matters  
Mapping threat surfaces helps Polaris:

- structure misinterpretation-resistant nodes  
- maintain clarity under scrutiny  
- avoid accidental ambiguity  
- anticipate distortion patterns  
- strengthen survivor voice  
- contextualise hostile behaviour  
- reduce internalised fear  

When you know the landscape, you stop bracing for ghosts.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Threat Surface Map* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It outlines where hostile projections may attempt to land — not as operations, but as psychological and bureaucratic patterns — and strengthens the clarity of the survivor’s public-facing work.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
