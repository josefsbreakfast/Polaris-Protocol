# 🎴 Tarot of Prime Ministers  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*A symbolic tarot-style mapping of recent UK Prime Ministers as archetypes — not of their politics, but of their narrative energy, institutional impact, and governance “vibe”.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This is **not** political endorsement or critique.  
It is an *archetypal mapping exercise* that treats Prime Ministers as symbols of the institutional weather of their era — using tarot’s narrative logic as the framing device.

Each PM is assigned a **Major Arcana** card that reflects how their governance *felt*, not how it performed.

## 🎴 Major Arcana Assignments

### **Tony Blair — The Magician (I)**  
**Keywords:** charisma, illusion, narrative mastery, transformation  
Blair was the archetype of political alchemy — new image, new language, new story.  
Light side: modernisation.  
Shadow side: illusion, overreach, the spell breaking.

---

### **Gordon Brown — The Hermit (IX)**  
**Keywords:** seriousness, introspection, duty, isolation  
A cerebral, often lonely figure carrying the lamp of economic caution.  
Served as the anti-illusion counterweight to Blair’s magician energy.

---

### **David Cameron — The Fool (0)**  
**Keywords:** naïveté, leaps without foresight, unintended consequences  
The Fool steps off cliffs believing the world will catch him.  
Austerity + Brexit referendum = the classic shadow Fool arc.

---

### **Theresa May — Justice (XI)**  
**Keywords:** order, procedure, impossible balances  
Her era was defined by rule-following, impossible political maths, and the emotional flatness of someone trying to restore balance with broken tools.

---

### **Boris Johnson — The Tower (XVI)**  
**Keywords:** chaos, collapse, revelation, hubris  
Every Tower card warns: what is unstable will fall.  
Johnson’s premiership was the lightning strike.

---

### **Liz Truss — The Eight of Wands (Minor Arcana)**  
**Keywords:** speed, recklessness, sudden movement, crash  
Not Major Arcana — her era was too short.  
Pure velocity without grounding.

---

### **Rishi Sunak — The Hanged Man (XII)**  
**Keywords:** suspended stasis, sacrifice, immobility  
A PM held in place, unable to act meaningfully, governing in limbo.

---

### **Keir Starmer — The Hierophant (V)**  
**Keywords:** order, procedure, institutional restoration  
Not romantic.  
Not dramatic.  
The filing cabinet in human form.  
Represents the return of rules, compliance, and predictable governance.
