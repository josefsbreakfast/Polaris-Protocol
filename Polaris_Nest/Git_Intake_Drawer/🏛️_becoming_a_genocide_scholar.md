# 🏛️ Becoming a Genocide Scholar  
**First created:** 2025-11-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-05  
*In which one accidentally earns a doctorate in atrocity logistics by trying to file the correct form.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Apparently, all it takes to become a genocide scholar in the algorithmic era is:  
1. A malfunctioning bureaucracy,  
2. Several incompatible data systems, and  
3. The stubborn insistence on reading the fine print.  

Somewhere between the Data Protection Act, Prevent referrals, and form-filling déjà vu, one realises that genocide studies is no longer a matter of history departments — it’s an **administrative aftertaste**.  The Anglophone Internet has quietly turned paperwork into a weapon, and the rest of us into its archivists.

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Fieldwork by accident:** Research begins when the dropdown menu won’t accept “human.”  
- **Moral injury as methodology:** The data subject learns faster than the data analyst.  
- **Institutional pedagogy:** The more forms you submit, the closer you get to comparative genocide studies.  
- **Ethnography of erasure:** FOIA requests are the new witness statements.  
- **Transdisciplinary trauma:** Bureaucracy is the seminar; the syllabus is the silence.

*Becoming a Genocide Scholar* is a living satirical node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how administrative systems train their own critics, converting every refused form into postgraduate research in atrocity prevention.
