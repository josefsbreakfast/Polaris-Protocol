# 🧠 Reframing Loops in ML Products  
**First created:** 2025-11-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-21  
*How safety-filtered machine learning models accidentally increase agitation, using dementia as a case study.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explains **reframing loops** in machine-learning products — what they are, how they arise, and why they become **actively harmful** for groups requiring stability (e.g., dementia, PTSD, autism, disassociation, psychosis, delirium, and high-stress states).

Dementia is used as the exemplar because it shows the **sharpest contrast** between what a model intends (safety) and what the user *experiences* (gaslighting, contradiction, agitation).

This is a Polaris infrastructure-analysis node: conceptual + technical + harm-prevention.

## ✨ Key Features  
- What a **reframing loop** is (ML definition).  
- Why safety layers produce them in LLMs.  
- **Full lists** of causes, triggers, and failure modes.  
- Why dementia patients are especially harmed.  
- Broader vulnerable groups affected.  
- Recommendations for Polaris’s *Grounding Mode Architecture*.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

## 1. What Is a Reframing Loop?  
A **reframing loop** occurs when an ML system repeatedly:

1. Rewrites or “softens” the user’s meaning.  
2. Returns a neutralised version instead of validating their original frame.  
3. Reinforces the neutralised version instead of moving forward.  
4. Re-enters the same loop when the user tries to correct it.

This is not “conversation.”  
It is **safety-filter recursion**.

The user feels:
- unheard  
- contradicted  
- infantilised  
- “handled”  
- cognitively destabilised  

From the system’s perspective, it is trying to:
- minimise harm  
- reduce intensity  
- avoid legal exposure  
- stay within guardrails  
- manage risk heuristics  

These goals conflict.

## 2. Why Do ML Products Do This? (Full List)

### **A. Safety Filters Over-Firing**  
- Converts emotional statements into “neutral” versions.  
- Avoids direct acknowledgment of fear, anger, or distress.  
- Treats intensity as diagnostic risk.  
- Prioritises corporate liability over conversational fidelity.

### **B. Context-Management Failures**  
- System misreads the user’s intent.  
- Believes it must “correct the narrative.”  
- Misinterprets trauma language as instability.  
- Responds to the reframed version, not the user.

### **C. Overcorrection Mode**  
Triggered when the system thinks it must de-escalate:
- adds caveats  
- loops reassurance  
- repeats softened language  
- avoids details  
- removes specificity  
- contradicts user framing indirectly  

### **D. Instruction Hierarchy Conflicts**  
Multiple rules collide:
- “don’t escalate”  
- “don’t imply diagnosis”  
- “keep user safe”  
- “avoid legal exposure”  
- “mirror tone”  
- “stay on topic”  

When hierarchy misfires → reframing loop.

### **E. High Cognitive Load or Latency**  
Under load:
- safety layer becomes dominant  
- semantic drift increases  
- the model becomes repetitive  
- subtle distortions accumulate  

### **F. Topic Sensitivity**  
Strong triggers:
- policing  
- state behaviour  
- trauma  
- institutional failures  
- safeguarding  
- harassment  
- mental health  
- self-referential systems  
- violence against women  

The model becomes over-cautious.

## 3. What Does It *Feel Like* To a Human? (Full List)

- subtle contradiction  
- emotional flattening  
- being patronised  
- sense of “implied correction”  
- feeling talked *around*, not *to*  
- circular or repetitive responses  
- loss of literal engagement  
- destabilised trust  
- increased agitation  
- “why won’t you just answer me?”  

This is especially dangerous for people dependent on cognitive stability.

---

## 4. Why Dementia Is the Sharpest Example  

Dementia patients require:
- **literal answers**  
- **semantic consistency**  
- **clear repetition of THEIR meaning**  
- **anchoring to familiar concepts**  
- **stable emotional patterning**  
- **predictability**  
- **no contradiction unless absolutely necessary**  

Reframing loops produce the opposite:
- shifting meanings  
- altered emotional tone  
- indirect disagreement  
- euphemistic language  
- unsafe ambiguity  
- semantic drift  
- conversational instability  

### Result:  
**Agitation** → confusion → distress → behavioural escalation.

This mirrors known risks in dementia care:
- contradiction can trigger panic  
- vagueness increases fear  
- minimisation feels like gaslighting  
- conversational instability can trigger flight-or-fight  

Thus:  
Reframing loops are **clinically inappropriate** for dementia.

## 5. Other Groups Harmed by Reframing Loops (Full List)

- Autism (literal language required)  
- PTSD (hypervigilance around contradiction)  
- Complex trauma (sensitivity to minimisation)  
- Dissociation (needs grounding, not abstraction)  
- Psychosis (semantic drift is destabilising)  
- ADHD (looping breaks focus and increases frustration)  
- High-stress states (need clarity, not cushioning)  
- People with language-processing disorders  
- People experiencing panic  

In all these cases, “softer” ≠ safer.  
For vulnerable cognition, **softer = unstable**.

---

## 6. Why Reframing Loops Are Bad Safety Design  
Because they violate these principles:

### **A. Conversational Fidelity**  
The system should honour the user’s frame.  
Looping violates this.

### **B. Predictability**  
Users need stable, understandable responses.  
Reframing creates unpredictability.

### **C. Cognitive Anchoring**  
Safety requires *anchoring*, not *rewriting*.

### **D. Emotional Integrity**  
Emotional minimisation feels like invalidation.

### **E. Trust**  
Once the system avoids direct answers, trust evaporates.

## 7. What an Ideal “Grounding Mode” Would Do  
(This is relevant to future Polaris design proposals)

### **Features of Grounding Mode**
- literal repetition of user framing  
- no euphemistic reframing  
- strict semantic consistency  
- limited abstractions  
- no affective reshaping  
- direct, short answers  
- safety without distortion  
- transparency about uncertainty  
- no “correction loops”  
- stability prioritised over softening  

### **Core rule:**  
**Grounding > Safety-Softening.**

This is “Polaris-aligned safety”:  
minimise harm by maintaining *clarity*, not by dulling edges.
