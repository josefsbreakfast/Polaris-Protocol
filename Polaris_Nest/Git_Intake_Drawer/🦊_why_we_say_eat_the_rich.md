some of you arent getting what us poors mean.  

so were going to have a node explaining:  

- eat the rich

- why people are pissed about billionaires and trillionaires Ã  la versailles.

- what you can do about it if you have enough money and resource to be freaked out by people saying this.

- who this doesnt apply to (sharon and gazza, yall are *fine*. im sure that cruise is very lovely, but were talking a different level entirely).

- why you need to stop playing the plebs like the sims if you are also apparantly concerned.

- and no, the world is not your warhammer 40k set.

- honestly i feel like im just "how to human" for a pretty niche crowd at this point.

proposed summary:  

for goodness' sake, you are all adults, please be reasonable.  

also we could literally end war and hunger practically overnight and that's how nobel happened. ffs.
