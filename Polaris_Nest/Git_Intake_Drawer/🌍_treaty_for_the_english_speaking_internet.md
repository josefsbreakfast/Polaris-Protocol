# 🌍 Treaty for the English-Speaking Internet  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*A proposal for an inter-English-language federation to fund, govern, and de-sludge the web.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
The Anglophone web has become functionally polluted.  
Everyday users now navigate a maze of cookie banners, redirect chains, SEO sludge, and fraudulent storefronts just to buy a sponge with ink.  
The experience gap between ordinary citizens and elite digital users has widened so far that **trust itself has collapsed as infrastructure**.

This node argues for a **treaty among English-speaking nations** — a cooperative civic commitment to clean up the shared language layer of the internet.

## 🧩 Core Proposal  

### 1.  🧱  Federation of Responsibility  
A compact among major English-speaking nations (UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the U.S., etc.)  
to pool funds for public-interest indexing, open-source ad-filtering, and metadata cleanup.  
Colonised or historically coerced English users should *never* be charged or burdened for access —  
instead, this treaty should **subsidise minority-language revival and maintenance** as an act of repair.

### 2.  🪞  Public-Service Search & Discovery  
Establish a **cooperative search index** with transparent ranking, no ad auction, and verified merchant routing.  
Focus on latency reduction, anti-spam weighting, and verified supply-chain listings for small businesses.  

### 3.  💡  Minimum Usability Standards  
A *UN-style digital commons rulebook*:  
- Max 1 second load target on non-media pages.  
- Ad volume ≤ 25 % of total render.  
- Cookie banners consolidated to one interoperable opt-in system.  
- Mandatory dark-mode & accessibility baseline.  

### 4.  ⚖️  Infrastructure Fairness Fund  
A levy on high-traffic ad networks + cloud providers, reinvested into:  
- minority-language digital infrastructure  
- cooperative moderation councils  
- open-index maintenance  
- literacy programmes for exhausted users  

### 5.  🧭  Societal Imperative  
The exhaustion you describe is political.  
People do not fall into conspiracy holes by nature; they do so because the legitimate routes to *information they can use* have collapsed under sludge.  
The treaty reframes cleanup as **public-health infrastructure**, not mere UX polish.
