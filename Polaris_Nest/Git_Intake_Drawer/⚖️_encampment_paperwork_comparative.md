## Summary table (initial harvest)

| University | Document / tactic | Date | Short description | Source |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **Columbia University (NYC)** | **Ultimatum / notice to leave & pledge form** | 29–30 Apr 2024 | Columbia distributed notices setting a 2pm deadline to clear tents or face suspension; reports state students were offered a form to sign committing to obey university policies (e.g. remain in good standing through June 2025) in exchange for avoiding suspension. Media documents suspensions initiated after deadline. | Columbia Spectator; PBS; Politico / AP reporting.

| **University of Nottingham (Jubilee Campus)** | **Possession order application & High Court summary possession judgment** | May → 9 Jul 2024 | Nottingham sought a possession order; Johnson J granted a campus-wide summary possession order in University of Nottingham v Butterworth & Persons Unknown [2024] EWHC 1771 (KB). Judgment notes orders can be made against “persons unknown” and addresses human-rights/public-law defences. | Approved Judgment in High Court authorities bundle; Landmark Chambers summary; Guardian reporting.

## Key comparative observations (work in progress)
- **Administrative/legal route:** Columbia used an internal disciplinary ultimatum (suspension threat + pledge); Nottingham used civil possession proceedings and relied on property/trespass legal mechanisms (court order). Both escalate via formal legal/administrative instruments rather than negotiated accommodation.  [oai_citation:8‡PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/columbia-university-tells-student-protesters-they-must-leave-tent-encampments-or-face-suspension?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Mechanics of coercion:** Columbia’s approach used the academic consequences (suspension, loss of graduation eligibility) as leverage; Nottingham used the civil court process (possession, risk of legal costs and enforcement) — both create high pressure with limited negotiation windows.  [oai_citation:9‡AP News](https://apnews.com/article/19ed919ff6ff9573a8add4ec67e26181?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **‘Persons unknown’ device:** Nottingham (and other UK university cases) explicitly relied on the legal device of proceedings against “persons unknown” to secure campus-wide orders; that procedural form is notable and affects how enforcement is framed.

## Evidence to add (next steps you can instruct me to fetch and attach)
1. **Columbia** — request or locate the actual ultimatum/pledge form (PDF or screenshot) circulated Apr 29–30, 2024 (student-media archives, PBS/Columbia Spectator images, or FOIA to Columbia).  [oai_citation:11‡Columbia Daily Spectator](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/29/columbia-begins-handing-out-notices-urging-encampment-participants-to-leave-warns-of-interim-suspension/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
2. **Nottingham** — attach the approved judgment PDF text for [2024] EWHC 1771 (KB) and any possession order application bundle or claim form; also fetch university letters/alerts to staff/students. The High Court judgment is available and I can extract the key paragraphs verbatim (short quotes only).  [oai_citation:12‡University of London](https://www.london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Claim-No-PT-2024-000893-Authorities-Bundle.pdf)  
3. **Annotate irregularities** — for each document, highlight wording that suggests selective invocation of rules, coercive deadlines, omission of negotiation channels, or mischaracterisations of who was present (e.g., “persons unknown” vs named students). Use exact text snippets where possible (≤25 words quoted), and otherwise paraphrase with page citations.

## Gaps identified (for investigative follow up)
- Full text of the Columbia pledge/notice (signed form) — not yet located as a download.  [oai_citation:14‡PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/columbia-university-tells-student-protesters-they-must-leave-tent-encampments-or-face-suspension?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Any internal memos or university-counsel templates showing the playbook used across campuses — might require FOI/FOIA requests or leaked internal documents.  [oai_citation:15‡What Do They Know](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/meetings_about_encampment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
