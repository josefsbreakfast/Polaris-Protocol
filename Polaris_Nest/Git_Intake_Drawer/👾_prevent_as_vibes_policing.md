🪐 PREVENT as Vibes Policing
First created: 2025-11-17 | Last updated: 2025-11-17
How a counter-terrorism duty drifted into mood interpretation, tone surveillance, and behaviour dampening.

⸻

Orientation
This note describes how PREVENT, originally framed as an early-intervention counter-extremism programme, has shifted in practice toward subjective risk interpretation. In many real environments it now operates less as a security mechanism and more as a form of behavioural moderation based on tone, affect, perceived attitude, or “concerning vibe.” This analysis focuses on structural drift rather than intent.

⸻

Key Features
• PREVENT relies heavily on subjective interpretation.
• Behaviours such as distress or anger are misread as risk.
• Systems lacking time, stability, or clarity default to tone-based judgement.
• “Vibes policing” emerges from institutional collapse, not design.

How PREVENT became interpretive rather than evidentiary
PREVENT’s statutory duty requires staff to identify signs of possible future radicalisation. The criteria are broad and inconsistently understood. In practice, this has created a shift from evidence-based concern to impression-based concern. When systems are overstretched, subjective impressions replace structured assessment.

What “vibes policing” means in this context
Vibes policing is the interpretation of normal human behaviours—stress, frustration, tiredness, emotional expression, political interest—as indicators of future ideological drift. This happens when staff rely on tone, perceived negativity, or intuitive concern rather than concrete risk.

Why subjective drift happens
Several factors contribute:
• limited training
• risk-averse institutional culture
• staff under pressure
• heavy time constraints
• multi-agency panic
• reliance on templates rather than context
• technological misreads or metadata noise
The system incentivises “erring on the side of caution,” which translates into escalating anything that feels “off.”

Examples of vibe-based misreads
• Trauma responses mistaken for radicalisation.
• Autistic flat affect interpreted as aloofness or hostility.
• Political anger seen as extremism.
• Cultural or religious expression perceived as suspicious.
• Distress during services misread as instability.

These examples reflect institutional fragility rather than individual danger.

Impact on marginalised groups
People already navigating racism, sexism, queerphobia, ableism, or poverty stress display emotional patterns that institutions often misinterpret. Vibes policing magnifies existing biases by turning subjective discomfort into formal concern.

Systems effects
When a counter-extremism framework relies on tone, it suppresses normal variation in behaviour. It discourages dissent, emotional expression, and complaint. It creates a background pressure to appear placid, apolitical, and compliant—irrespective of context. This results in behaviour dampening rather than safeguarding.

Why this matters
A vibes-based PREVENT environment undermines trust, escalates wrongly, and fails to detect genuine risk. It also corrodes the credibility of safeguarding systems more broadly. Recognising the subjective drift is a first step toward reframing the duty and reducing harm.
