# 📓 Hackathon Playbook Companion  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*A lightweight replay log for the Hackathon League — designed for zero-friction note-taking.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
The *Playbook Companion* captures the evolving wisdom of each hackathon drill.  
It’s deliberately lo-fi: no spreadsheet formulas, no dashboards.  
Just human-readable logs that record **how coordination actually felt** — latency, surprises, assists, and learning moments.

This file functions like a season journal.  
Each new event adds a short entry that teams can append without breaking structure.

---

## 🗂️ How to Use  
1. Copy one template block per event.  
2. Fill in names, highlights, notes — bullet-point style.  
3. Drop screenshots, snippets, or debrief links inline if needed.  
4. Don’t overthink formatting: clean text is the only rule.
