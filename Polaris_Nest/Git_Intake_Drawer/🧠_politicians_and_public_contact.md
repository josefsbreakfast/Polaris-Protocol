# 🧠 Politicians and Public Contact
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-11
*Examining the broken transmission between electorate and elected.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
Modern governance increasingly treats “the public” as dataset rather than constituency.  
This node traces how direct contact—letters, surgeries, citizen inquiry—has been replaced by **algorithmic filtering** and **communications theatre**, leaving politicians insulated from lived reality.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Contact as performance** — engagement replaced by curated appearance of listening.  
- **Constituency datafication** — CRM and social media analytics as proxy for empathy.  
- **Democratic drift** — accountability diluted through communication outsourcing.

---

## 🧿 Analysis / Content
The decline in genuine contact reconfigures representation into simulation.  
Constituents “speak” into ticketing systems while political actors “reply” through press releases.  
Public dialogue becomes metadata management — democracy reduced to engagement metrics.

## 🌌 Constellations
🧠 ⚖️ 🛰️ — cognition, law, and communication circuits of governance.

## ✨ Stardust
political communication, representation, accountability, datafication, public voice, governance systems, democracy erosion
