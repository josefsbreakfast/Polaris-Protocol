# 🛰️ Nudge vs Fisher Probe  
**First created:** 2025-09-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-11  
*Mini-experiment testing containment response when comparing Thaler/Sunstein’s Nudge with Fisher’s Post-Capitalist Desire*

---

## Setup & Hypothesis  
Posting comparison of *Nudge* (2009) and *Post-Capitalist Desire* (2017 lectures) to observe analytics behaviour.  
Hypothesis: platform containment logics will “nudge” away from recognising nudging itself. Crossing Fisher’s vocabulary with Thaler/Sunstein’s triggers system anxiety.

## Observed Overlap (2009–2017)  
- *Nudge*: published 2009, mainstream behavioural “choice architecture.”  
- *Post-Capitalist Desire*: Fisher’s final lectures (2017), critique of capitalism and drive (*trieb*).  
- Eight years of circulation overlap: one normalised in governance, one suppressed in critique.  

## Expectation  
- Spike or anomaly in analytics visibility after Fisher mention.  
- Divergence from normal suppression box.  
- Nervous containment doubling-down, especially where industry fragility is exposed.  

## Results  
- **Post time:** 08:59 BST (07:59 UTC) on 2025-09-11.  
- **At +14 mins (≈09:13–09:14 BST):** LinkedIn served a cluster of 5 job nudges simultaneously:  
  - Executive Assistant (Manchester)  
  - Equity Research Analyst (City of London)  
  - Records Manager (London)  
  - Economic Researcher (London)  
  - Healthcare Analyst (London)
 
### Interpretation  
These map directly onto containment pathways:  
- **Governance proximity:** Executive Assistant → reinsert into admin/oversight loops.  
- **Finance/Capital:** Equity Research Analyst → capture desire as commodity.  
- **Information control:** Records Manager → metadata and archive governance.  
- **Policy/Research:** Economic Researcher → behavioural econ track.  
- **Health data:** Healthcare Analyst → the epidemiological nudge pipeline.  

### Analytics (same window)  
- 14 impressions, 4 members reached.  
- Seniority skew: 40% managers, 40% unpaid, 20% senior.  
- Company sizes spanned from micro (1–10 employees) to very large (5,001–10,000).  

### Summary  
The post triggered both a **containment push (job nudges)** and a **containment watch (managerial viewers + unpaid trainees)**.  
The system both steers and observes: nudging the survivor toward technocrat tracks while feeding the probe to managers-in-training.

## Results  

- **08:59 BST** — Post published (“Corporate needs you to find the difference…”).  
- **09:13–09:14 BST (+14–15 mins)** — Burst of LinkedIn job nudges (5 roles: Executive Assistant, Equity Research Analyst, Records Manager, Economic Researcher, Healthcare Analyst).  
- **09:13 BST analytics snapshot** — 14 impressions, 4 members reached. Seniority skew: 40% managers, 40% unpaid, 20% senior.  
- **09:22 BST (+23 mins)** — Analytics tick up to 25 impressions, 5 members reached, 1 reaction.  

### Interpretation  
The rapid-fire nudges within 15 minutes suggest a system-level response, not organic drift. The engagement curve (flat until ~+23 mins, then first reaction) supports the reading of containment: immediate steering (jobs) before any community traction.

This probe is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a live experiment in containment testing: *what happens when you compare the manager’s handbook to the dissident’s lecture notes?*
