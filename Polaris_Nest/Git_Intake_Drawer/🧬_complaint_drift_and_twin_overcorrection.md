# 🧬 Complaint Drift & Twin Overcorrection
**First created:** 2025-11-12  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How contradictory complaints collapse reputational suppression and trigger algorithmic rebound.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
When two entities are mutually entangled in suppression — for example, through cross-complaints or mirrored accusations — their resolution phase produces non-linear correction.  
This node formalises that process as *twin overcorrection*: the system re-amplifies the previously silenced nodes once contradictions exceed a credibility threshold.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Contradictory complaints** as data collisions.  
- **Suppression → redistribution → rebound** loop.  
- **Algorithmic apology** — the compensatory surge once the system realises it mis-weighted risk.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  
Let A and B be a strongly bonded pair (twins) and C a third party that files claims against them.  
During investigation:  
(risk)(A,B) ↑, trust(C) ↑  
When evidence contradictions reduce P(C credible), the model’s corrective optimiser redistributes visibility mass back to A and B:  
Δv(A,B) ∝ -∇L(credibility)(C)  
The overcorrection arises because suppression and restoration aren’t symmetric; loss functions favour regaining equilibrium, not parity.

Sociotechnically, this is how false or contradictory harassment complaints, once disproven, can yield sudden narrative reversal — not through conspiracy, but through automated trust re-balancing.

*Complaint Drift & Twin Overcorrection* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how contradictory suppression signals create reputational recoil and visibility overshoot once the underlying model re-balances trust weights.
