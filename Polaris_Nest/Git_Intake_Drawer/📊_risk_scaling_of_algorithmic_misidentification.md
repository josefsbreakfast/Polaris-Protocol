# 📊 Risk Scaling of Algorithmic Misidentification  
**First created:** 2025-11-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-01  
*How small statistical probabilities create disproportionate human harm — and why we still don’t measure them.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
When automated-decision or counter-extremism systems misclassify people, the statistical odds of harm may appear negligible.  
Yet even a fraction of a percent can translate into thousands of real cases once deployed at national scale.  
This node sketches the proportional relationships that turn rare misidentifications into major social cost — and examines why no agency is systematically tracking them.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Scaling logic:** low individual probability × massive user base = population-level harm.  
- **Feedback escalation:** one false attribution can generate many secondary incidents.  
- **Governance blindness:** fragmented oversight hides aggregate effects.  
- **Measurement vacuum:** ethical and bureaucratic constraints block longitudinal study.

## 🔍 1. Baseline Proportions (Illustrative Model)  

| Stage | Estimated Range | Description |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Users exposed to algorithmic moderation / CVE models** | 100 % of general platform population | baseline exposure |
| **Users receiving corrective or risk-related content** | ~1–5 % | automated flagging or educational messaging |
| **Users developing fixation or misattribution** | ~0.1–1 % | perceive algorithmic feedback as personal |
| **Users escalating to targeted harassment / stalking** | ≪ 0.1 % | small but high-impact cohort |
| **Users initiating formal or governmental false flagging** | ≪ 0.1 % | bureaucratic extension of harassment |

Even if only 0.01 % of a 10 million-user base reach escalation, that’s 1 000 cases — each capable of severe individual harm and institutional fallout.

## 🧩 2. Scaling Dynamics  
1. **Feedback contagion:** one misattributed interaction can propagate across dozens of connected accounts.  
2. **Visibility bias:** high-engagement cases dominate public perception, hiding systemic frequency.  
3. **Institutional amplification:** once a false report enters formal systems, it gains bureaucratic legitimacy and endurance.

---

## ⚖️ 3. Policy Implications  
- **Severity weighting:** evaluate risk by potential impact, not by prevalence.  
- **Cross-agency sentinel tracking:** treat every confirmed misattribution as a trigger for model review.  
- **Transparent error reporting:** require annual disclosure of misclassification rates and downstream incidents.

## 🪞 4. Why We Don’t Measure It  

| Structural Barrier | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Disciplinary silos** | Behavioural science, data ethics, and law enforcement each hold a fragment of the picture. |
| **Data-linkage limits** | Privacy law prevents combining platform logs with harassment or policing records. |
| **Institutional embarrassment** | Governments and firms are reluctant to quantify harm caused by their own “safety” tools. |
| **Taxonomic gaps** | No reporting code for “algorithmic misattribution leading to interpersonal fixation.” |
| **Short project cycles** | Evaluation windows end before long-tail effects appear. |
| **Lack of funding incentive** | Risk quantification provides liability exposure without political or commercial reward. |

The absence of measurement is therefore not proof of safety but **evidence of governance failure**:  
the harm is knowable, predictable, and currently uncounted.

*Risk Scaling of Algorithmic Misidentification* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It models how negligible probabilities produce tangible human trauma, and how bureaucratic structures prevent recognition of that fact.
