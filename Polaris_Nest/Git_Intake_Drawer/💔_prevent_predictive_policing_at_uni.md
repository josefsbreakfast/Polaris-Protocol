# 💔 PREVENT as Predictive-Policing Logic in Higher Education
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23
*How PREVENT introduced anticipatory surveillance culture into UK universities without requiring predictive-policing technology.*

## Orientation
This note explains how PREVENT, after becoming a statutory duty in 2015, embedded the logic of predictive policing into higher education. Universities did not deploy predictive-policing software, but they adopted policies and practices built around prediction, early-intervention, environmental scanning, and anticipatory suspicion. This created a culture of monitoring and behavioural interpretation across entire student populations.

## Key Features
- PREVENT imported pre-crime logic into university settings.
- Universities adopted anticipatory monitoring practices.
- Staff were encouraged to interpret behaviour as risk signals.
- Predictive culture was achieved without predictive technology.

## How PREVENT reshaped the organisational worldview of universities
The 2015 PREVENT duty required universities to “have due regard to preventing people from being drawn into terrorism.” This was interpreted as an obligation to detect early signs of ideological drift. As a result, universities introduced new governance behaviours:
- scanning for unusual or concerning patterns
- anticipating potential vulnerabilities
- flagging small behavioural changes
- increased reporting of subjective impressions
This mirrored predictive-policing logic even though universities lacked policing powers.

## Predictive logic vs predictive infrastructure
Predictive logic is the belief that behaviour today can indicate risk tomorrow. PREVENT gave universities:
- indicators lists
- vulnerability frameworks
- behavioural templates
- anticipatory guidance
Predictive infrastructure, by contrast, involves machine-learning models or risk-scoring algorithms. Universities did not adopt these; they adopted the mindset.

## Staff as human predictive engines
Academics, tutors, supervisors, and pastoral staff became informal risk assessors. Training encouraged them to identify:
- shifts in mood
- expressions of anger
- political curiosity
- withdrawal or disengagement
- changes in dress or social circle
These are subjective and culturally loaded interpretations. They foster a predictive surveillance environment without centralised tech.

## Why this matters for civil liberties
When predictive-logic enters the classroom, intellectual exploration becomes risky. Students modify speech, avoid political topics, and hide distress. Academics self-censor. Normal discomfort or frustration becomes liable to be interpreted as an early “indicator.” This evolution produces behaviour dampening across the sector.

## The role of administrative systems
Universities began integrating attendance, engagement, and digital learning analytics into “student wellbeing” frameworks. Though not designed for PREVENT, these systems:
- track patterns over time
- flag disengagement
- compare behaviour to normative baselines
- generate alerts
PREVENT, layered over these norms, inherits the predictive flavour even without data-sharing or police involvement.

## Impact on marginalised students
Students who are racialised, Muslim, queer, mentally ill, autistic, economically stressed, or politically outspoken experience disproportionate scrutiny. Their behaviours are more likely to be coded as “unusual,” “withdrawn,” “agitated,” or “concerning.” Predictive logic amplifies structural bias.

## Why predictive logic persists even when it fails
Predictive-style frameworks offer institutions an illusion of control. In times of political uncertainty or campus tension, universities lean more heavily on PREVENT-aligned practices—even when there is no evidence that such practices reduce harm.
