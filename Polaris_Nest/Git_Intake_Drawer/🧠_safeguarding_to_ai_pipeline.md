# 🧠 Safeguarding to AI Pipeline — How Welfare Data Enters Research and Middleware Pilots  
**First created:** 2025-10-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-13  
*A structural diagram tracing the lawful route by which safeguarding records can flow into research or AI middleware environments.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node explains the **bureaucratic chain** that allows information gathered for safeguarding or welfare purposes to be reused in R&D or AI “innovation” pilots.  
Each hand-off may be lawful on its own, yet together they form a *pipeline* that can feel opaque or coercive to the person whose data it concerns.  
It is a conceptual teaching model — not an allegation of misconduct.

## 🗺  Flow: From Safeguarding Record to AI Middleware Pilot  

```mermaid

  A[💬 Public-service interaction e.g. NHS, school, council] --> B{Safeguarding or Prevent flag?}
  B -->|Yes| C[📂 Record created under 'vulnerability' or 'risk' category e.g. CTSA 2015 s.26 duty]
  B -->|No| Z[Normal case i.e. standard GDPR rules)]

  I --> J[📡 Live data stream / retrospective model training]
  J --> K{Oversight invoked?}
  K -->|Yes| L[⚖️ Ethics report / DPIA filed under DPA 2018 Sch. 2 research exemption]
  K -->|No| M[🕳 'Proof of concept' runs quietly under NDA or tech-demo clause]
  L --> N[💡 Outputs fed into risk-scoring tools]
  M --> N

## ⚙️  Key Legal Turning Points  

| Stage | Legal Mechanism | Oversight Gap |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Safeguarding flag | CTSA 2015 s.26 (PREVENT duty) | Data sharing without consent |
| Research re-framing | DPA 2018 Sch. 2 §27 (research exemption) | Removes consent requirement |
| Ethics approval | REC / HRA review | Ignores surveillance-law implications |
| Contractor partnership | Innovation procurement / NDA | Shields pilot scope from public view |
| Oversight review | DPIA (when done) | Fragmented / optional in practice |

## 🔍  Analysis  
- **Administrative illusion:** Each authority sees a lawful micro-task; no one owns the macro-pipeline.  
- **Opacity cascade:** “Public interest” justifications stack, erasing traceability.  
- **Psychological impact:** subjects experience unaccountable monitoring disguised as care.  
- **Governance cost:** oversight bodies cannot reconstruct lineage once pilots end.

## ⚖️  Legal & Ethical Anchors  
- *Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 s.26* (PREVENT duty)  
- *Data Protection Act 2018* Sch. 2 §27 (research exemption)  
- *Investigatory Powers Act 2016* (warrants and interception)  
- *ECHR Articles 8 & 13* (right to privacy and effective remedy)

*Safeguarding to AI Pipeline — How Welfare Data Enters Research and Middleware Pilots* is a living diagrammatic node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It illustrates how lawful frameworks can interlock to move personal data from care settings into algorithmic environments without direct consent or awareness.
