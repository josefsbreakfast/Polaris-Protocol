*How justified anger functions as clarity rather than loss of control.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Certain forms of anger are not destabilising — they are *diagnostic*.  
This node maps how ethically-proportionate, controlled fury appears in analytical writing, why institutions fear it, and how it sharpens early recognition of harm.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Anger as structural clarity, not volatility  
- Why adversaries misread justified fury as threat  
- How controlled tone activates professional audiences  
- The political risk of moral coherence during crisis years

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Anger as Method  
Controlled fury clarifies:
- where harm originates  
- who benefits  
- what patterns repeat  
- which excuses are false  

It is forensic, not emotional discharge.

### 2. Why Institutions Fear It  
Because controlled anger:
- cannot be dismissed as hysteria  
- disrupts euphemistic frames  
- shortens denial timelines  
- activates the professional class  

### 3. Why It Is Politically Dangerous in Volatile Years  
2020–2025 public anger was already high.  
A book that gives readers *vocabulary* for that anger becomes a lever — not a flare.

### 4. How Suppression Reacts  
Typical responses:
- cooling  
- reputational distancing  
- “tone concerns”  
- quiet shelving  
- deprioritised publicity  

The suppression is about **containment of clarity**, not emotion.
