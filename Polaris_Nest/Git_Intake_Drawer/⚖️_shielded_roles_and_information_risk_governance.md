*Why MOD’s SIROs remain nameless and what that means for accountability.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) sits where governance meets secrecy. Their anonymity is an artefact of a system built to hide the person most responsible for exposure.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Functional Anonymity:** names redacted under FOI s.40/24.
- **Rotating 3★ appointments:** responsibility without public identity.
- **Structural Shield:** security justification doubles as reputational buffer.
- **Impact:** public traceability of accountability → near zero.

---

## 🧿 Analysis  
Shielded roles show how risk ownership is displaced upward and outward. By making responsibility invisible, the department inoculates itself against blame. Transparency becomes an operational threat instead of a civic necessity.
