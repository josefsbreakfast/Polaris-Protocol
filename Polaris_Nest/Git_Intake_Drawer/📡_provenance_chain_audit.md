# 📡 Provenance Chain Audit  
**First created:** 2025-10-31  
*Tracing authorship, consent, and custody across the life of a digital record.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

A **provenance chain audit** is the forensics of authenticity.  
It reconstructs *who touched what, when, and under what authority*—  
the invisible biography of a file.  
Where verification proves integrity at a moment, provenance proves it across time.  

> *Truth has a timestamp.*

---

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Chain-of-custody mapping** — documenting every hand-off and transformation.  
- **Cross-system reconciliation** — aligning internal logs with external signatures.  
- **Temporal integrity** — verifying chronological order to detect backdated edits.  
- **Consent lineage** — confirming that permission followed the data downstream.  
- **Audit resilience** — reports remain verifiable even if original systems vanish.

## 🧠 Pattern Analysis  

### 1️⃣ The ledger problem  
Most organisations keep partial logs—storage timestamps, email trails, approval forms—  
but lack a unified ledger linking them.  
A provenance audit stitches these fragments into a narrative timeline, exposing gaps where accountability should live.

### 2️⃣ Divergent clocks  
Different systems record events in different time zones, formats, or precisions.  
Reconciling them converts administrative chaos into evidential clarity.  
Temporal misalignment is often the first clue of tampering or concealment.

### 3️⃣ Consent continuity  
Verification without consent lineage is incomplete.  
Every derivative dataset must carry its ancestor’s consent token, allowing a reviewer to trace ownership back to the participant.  
If a link breaks, processing halts until consent is re-established.

### 4️⃣ Institutional amnesia  
Legacy migrations and vendor changes erode memory.  
A robust audit embeds redundancy: mirrored logs, open formats, and periodic public hashing to prove the record once existed intact.

## ⚖️ Governance Implications  

Under **UK GDPR** and **Data Protection Act 2018**, controllers must demonstrate *accountability* and *integrity of processing.*  
A provenance chain audit operationalises these duties by turning policy into proof.  
In evidential contexts—journalism, research, or law enforcement—it also supports admissibility by demonstrating *continuity of possession.*  
Ethically, it honours the principle that every data subject retains visibility over their digital shadow.

## 🛠 Implementation Principles  

| **Layer** | **Audit mechanism** |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Logging** | Append-only ledgers with cryptographic signing (blockchain optional, immutability essential). |
| **Time synchronisation** | Network-wide trusted clock authority; UTC standardisation. |
| **Consent linkage** | Hash consent token at each transfer; reject files without match. |
| **Verification check-ins** | Scheduled integrity scans and hash comparisons. |
| **Public transparency** | Publish anonymised proof-of-existence hashes for external validation. |

## 🏮 Footer  

*📡 Provenance Chain Audit* is the narrative half of verification—  
the story of how evidence remembers itself.  
It completes the **Cloneproof Protocol** constellation alongside:  

- **🧬 Voice-Model Capture Risks** — why provenance can be lost.  
- **⚙️ Verification & Watermarking Standards** — how authenticity is measured.  
- **🛡️ Survivor-Consent Frameworks** — how permission travels with the data.  

> *Integrity is not trust—it’s trace.*
