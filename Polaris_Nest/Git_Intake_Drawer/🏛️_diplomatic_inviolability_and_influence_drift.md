# 🏛️ Diplomatic inviolability and influence drift

*How protected diplomatic space enables influence without trace, and why weak process turns relationship management into policy capture.*

## 🧭 What this node is
This node explains how **diplomatic inviolability**, informal engagement, and elite relationship management can:

- bypass ordinary transparency,
- concentrate influence upstream,
- and generate policy continuity through drift rather than decision.

It does **not** allege illegality.  
It maps **structural opacity**.

---

## 🏛️ Inviolability (what it is, what it isn’t)
Embassies are **not sovereign territory**.

They are:
- inviolable under diplomatic law,
- protected from entry and search,
- shielded from routine disclosure regimes.

The effect is practical insulation:
- meetings are not FOI-able,
- informal assurances leave little record,
- influence occurs outside administrative audit trails.

This is a design feature of diplomacy.

## 🧩 Influence without transaction
Modern diplomatic influence rarely looks like:

- bribes,
- instructions,
- or explicit threats.

It looks like:
- access,
- reassurance,
- framing,
- selective disclosure,
- and cultivation of trust.

This produces **anticipatory alignment**:
- decision-makers internalise partner priorities,
- friction feels like betrayal,
- delay feels responsible.

Nothing illegal needs to happen.

## 🧠 Why ministers are the focal point
Because UK authority is concentrated:

- influencing ministers influences the system,
- downstream institutions cannot countermand,
- and civil–military actors become implementers, not arbiters.

Once ministers are comfortable:
- continuity self-executes,
- refusal space collapses below,
- and policy hardens without formal declaration.

---

## 🔁 Drift mechanics (how it happens)
Influence drift typically follows this pattern:

1. Early crisis framed as exceptional.
2. Private reassurance substitutes for public boundary-setting.
3. Reviews are initiated, not suspensions.
4. Time passes under continuity.
5. Facts on the ground change irreversibly.
6. Later adjustment is framed as pragmatism.

No single step looks decisive.  
Together they entrench posture.

## ⚖️ Why this matters for prevention
Genocide prevention and IHL compliance require:

- early interruption,
- explicit lines,
- and visible consequences.

Diplomatic drift:
- delays confrontation,
- preserves ambiguity,
- and reframes duty as discretion.

By the time influence is visible externally, **prevention windows have closed**.

---

## 🧯 Downstream effects
- Ministerial comfort substitutes for legal certainty.
- Civil servants lack grounds to refuse.
- Courts and committees inherit faits accomplis.
- Public accountability is displaced by secrecy norms.
- Law becomes ambience rather than constraint.

---

## 🧷 Working claim
Diplomatic inviolability does not cause harm.

But where:
- authority is centralised,
- safeguards are weak,
- and crisis is prolonged,

it enables **influence without accountability**, and policy becomes the cumulative effect of comfort rather than the product of decision.

## 🏮 Footer

*Diplomatic inviolability and influence drift* is a structural diplomacy node in the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to explain how lawful diplomatic practices can, under weak process conditions, undermine early intervention duties without leaving evidence of wrongdoing.
