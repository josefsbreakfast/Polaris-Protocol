# ⚖️ Redress Models and Limits — Learning from UK Precedents  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Considers how compensation schemes in the UK handle large-scale harm, and why a hybrid model (banded core awards + assessed damages for severe cases) is most appropriate for data-twin/false-provenance harms.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Simple banded compensation risks underpaying those who suffered catastrophic harm. Full assessment for all cases risks delay and administrative overload. UK practice shows a **hybrid model** can balance fairness with feasibility. This node records precedents and applies them to the current context.

## 📍 UK Precedents  

### Post Office Horizon  
- Core: fixed offers to accelerate payments.  
- Supplement: “full claims track” for consequential losses and catastrophic harms.  
- Lesson: need for individual assessments alongside banding to capture outlier losses.  

### Infected Blood  
- Core: tariff-based interim awards.  
- Supplement: provision for assessed top-ups once lifetime impacts clearer.  
- Lesson: catastrophic cases need bespoke handling; hybrid structure is accepted.  

### Windrush  
- Primarily banded scheme, but criticised for being too rigid and under-compensating those with profound harms.  
- Lesson: pure tariff models fail those at the extreme end of harm.

## 📍 Models Considered  

### 1. Pure tariff  
- **Pros:** fast, predictable costs.  
- **Cons:** cannot capture catastrophic harms; risk of systemic underpayment.  

### 2. Pure assessment  
- **Pros:** individual justice.  
- **Cons:** high cost, delays, legal overhead; vulnerable to bureaucratic stalling.  

### 3. Hybrid (recommended)  
- **Tier 1 (Banded awards):** £25k–£200k, evidence-based, for majority of cases.  
- **Tier 2 (Assessed damages):** unlimited, tribunal-assessed, for catastrophic harms (career destroyed, lifetime earnings loss, medical/psychological impact).  
- **Tier 3 (Systemic settlements):** optional class/group remedies for clusters (e.g., whole cohorts in a department or profession affected).

## 📈 Strategic Insight  
- Hybrid models are already in use in the UK; adopting one here aligns with precedent.  
- Provides justice to those most harmed without overwhelming the system.  
- Protects public finances by banding most cases while recognising catastrophic outliers.
