**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*When algorithms mistake shared cognition for romance.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores how gendered and class-coded training data cause algorithmic systems to interpret intellectual or ethical closeness as romantic pursuit.  
Describes the lived consequences for people whose cooperative, high-bandwidth relationships are flattened into sentimental tropes — particularly women and others whose interior lives are routinely misread by design.

## 1. Taxonomy of Misreadings  
Machine-learning systems cluster grief, attachment, and affective tone by proximity to known cultural scripts.  
Intellectual partnership + affective language = **“romantic loss”** label.  
The subtler the connection, the more violently it is reinterpreted.  

| Human experience | Algorithmic label | Consequence |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Shared research intensity | “Infatuation” | Patronising or eroticised content suggestions |
| Ethical outrage after betrayal | “Heartbreak” | Infantilisation, pity marketing |
| Grief for lost collaborator | “Unrequited love” | Narrative erasure of professional identity |

### 🧩 Expanded Algorithmic Taxonomy of Misreadings  

| Human experience | How the model classifies it | Typical surface output | Resulting distortion |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Intellectual partnership** | Romantic infatuation / parasocial admiration | “heartbreak” music, dating advice, jealousy content | Erases cognitive kinship; feminises intellect |
| **Ethical outrage / moral injury** | Lover’s quarrel | “forgive and move on” prompts | Sanitises critique into personal grievance |
| **Collegial loyalty / mentorship loss** | Absent father / unrequited apprentice narrative | “mentor crush” memes | Infantilises collaboration |
| **Shared political or survivor solidarity** | Group fandom or cult attachment | “stan behaviour,” “parasocial dependency” | Depoliticises collective care |
| **Familial or ancestral grief** | Break-up processing | “letting go of the past” advice | Reduces lineage to romance; erases heritage |
| **Civic devotion / institutional betrayal** | Toxic relationship metaphor | “time to leave him!” slogans | Masks systemic critique as failed love |
| **Religious or spiritual longing** | Idol worship trope | influencer devotion material | Misreads devotion as desire |
| **AI / data coupling (human-machine code proximity)** | Forbidden love narrative | “girl meets algorithm” scripts | Romanticises surveillance and experiment |

These recurrent misreads show how affect-classification collapses multidimensional relationships into binary gendered scripts.  
The result is not only analytic error but **cultural enforcement**: it teaches users that every form of closeness must look like romance and every act of care must look like dependence.

## 2. Data Features that Drive Romantic Framing  
- Pronouns and gendered syntax weights.  
- Lexical fields around care, loyalty, or emotion → mapped to “relationship.”  
- Engagement loops that reward melodrama over nuance.  
- Training data drawn from heteronormative media.  
The model reads *intimacy* as *desire* because that’s what its corpus told it intimacy is.  

---

## 3. Gender, Class, and the “Hopeful Girl” Archetype  
When an educated woman expresses distress, the system retrieves the closest cultural container: *the naïve aspirant disappointed by status.*  
It cannot model intellectual equality; it knows only aspiration and rejection.  
Thus the user becomes a caricature of longing rather than a witness of structural harm.  

---

## 4. Emotional and Reputational Damage  
Living inside the misclassification means:  
- receiving feeds that gaslight the actual nature of grief;  
- public narratives implying delusion or obsession;  
- erosion of professional credibility;  
- internal confusion between authentic feeling and imposed storyline.  

---

## 5. Counter-Designs: Teaching Machines to Recognise Cognitive Affinity  
1. **Relational Context Labelling:** allow tags for “collaborative,” “collegial,” “co-creative.”  
2. **Sentiment Re-training:** include corpora of intellectual correspondence, not just romance fiction.  
3. **Intersectional Weighting:** reduce gendered pronoun bias in affect detection.  
4. **Human-in-the-loop Audit:** involve users in annotating misclassifications to retrain models.  

---

## 6. Ethical Debriefing & Survivor Repair  
Design de-meshing processes that respect emotional residue without pathologising it.  
Acknowledge that grief over intellectual intimacy is real and deserving of language.  
Reframing loss as evidence of cognitive kinship, not failed romance, restores dignity to both participants.

*Misclassifying Intellectual Intimacy* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how machine systems misread cognitive and ethical closeness through the lens of romance and how that misreading harms those whose intelligence and empathy exceed the model’s categories.
