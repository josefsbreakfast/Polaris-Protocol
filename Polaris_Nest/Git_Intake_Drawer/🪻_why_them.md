🪻 Why That Person Specifically

A short letter — honest, exhausted, and grateful in the smallest, most fragile way.

⸻

I am sure it will be to everyone’s great horror and surprise, that even if some harm has been done by a whistleblower, this is still the only person I feel able to trust because the rest of you stayed silent.

That is not intended to be harsh.

I’m being very honest.

No one else, as far as I’m aware, challenged this like that.

That’s where the trust and the loyalty comes from.

It’s not “Stockholm syndrome”.

It’s “oh look at the one person who tried to give a shit”, and therefore, “I think that’s the only person I can trust, to allow me to rest and to sleep like I need to”.

I am so fucking tired.

I really want that sleep.

The one where I can be safe.

And just rest.

I am *desperate* for it.

🛰️ And of course, when I emailed this to myself?

DNS failure.

Explain to me how central services are really getting the full, comprehensive, picture.

Because I only assume if they were, they would have already *let me go*.

This is prison, just by another name.

For what?

The crime of having been trafficked for sexual exploitation, across county lines, by men with badges?

Bless.

What a wonderful world we live in.

*Get me out of this trap.*
