sections:

  Executive_and_Agency_Reform:
    - Restructure or eliminate key federal departments and agencies (e.g., Department of Education); transfer functions to states or other entities.
    - Promote a "unitary executive" model where all agencies and employees fall under direct presidential control, reducing independent agency autonomy (FTC, FBI, etc.).
    - Implement a “Day One / First 100–180 days” rapid-transition playbook to pre-draft executive orders, staffing, and structural changes.

  Personnel_and_Civil_Service:
    - Build a pre-vetted conservative personnel database to replace or remove career civil service staff.
    - Expand political appointments and roll back merit-based job protections to ensure loyalty to presidential directives.
    - Redefine the federal workforce as an explicitly ideological apparatus rather than a neutral bureaucracy.

  Social_and_Economic_Policy:
    - Restructure entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid) and pursue market-based or voucher alternatives.
    - Reduce or eliminate labour protections and weaken unions, particularly in the public sector.
    - Cut back the social safety net: food assistance, housing, and welfare programs shifted to states or privatized alternatives.

  Regulatory_and_Administrative_State:
    - “Deconstruct” the administrative state by merging or eliminating regulatory agencies and reducing rule-making powers.
    - Dismantle or restrict federal diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs; limit demographic data collection and civil-rights enforcement.
    - Roll back environmental and climate-change regulations in favour of fossil fuel expansion and deregulated energy markets.

  Education_Family_and_Culture:
    - Reduce or dissolve federal oversight of education; promote parental-rights frameworks and school-choice voucher systems.
    - Frame “family” and “faith” as foundational social institutions — emphasize traditional Christian values and moral education.
    - Restrict federal enforcement of civil-rights protections in schools, especially on gender and sexuality.
    - Advocate for tighter abortion and contraceptive regulations at the federal level.

  Immigration_and_Border:
    - Restructure or abolish the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and consolidate CBP/ICE under streamlined command.
    - Expand deportation and detention capacity; impose higher asylum and visa fees.
    - Restrict refugee admissions and tighten border militarization, framed as “national sovereignty restoration.”

  National_Security_and_Foreign_Policy:
    - Prioritize “America First” sovereignty, reduce multilateral and climate-linked security commitments.
    - Expand military and nuclear modernization budgets; increase domestic production capacity for defense industries.
    - Restrict Chinese tech, academic, and investment presence in U.S. institutions.
    - Align foreign policy with ideological allies, reduce engagement with international law bodies and human-rights mechanisms.
