*Concise, privacy-first checklist for reclaiming digital calm and gathering low-risk evidence.*

## Goal
Give yourself breathing room online: reduce surveillance surface, limit automated flagging vectors, and collect minimal evidence so you can prove patterns later if you choose.

---

## Quick checklist (45–90 min)

### 1 — Evidence & timeline
- Create `timeline.md` — 1-line entries (date/time, platform, what changed).  
- Save screenshots, emails, notifications; zip into `evidence_[date].zip`.

### 2 — Account hardening
- Rotate passwords; enable hardware-backed 2FA.  
- Revoke third-party app permissions.  
- Audit recovery emails/phones.  
- Lock devices (PIN + biometrics).

### 3 — Low-noise OPSEC
- Create a *clean control account*.  
- Use it for neutral A/B tests.  
- Avoid posting sensitive material from suspected compromised devices.

### 4 — Honeytoken & A/B tests
- Post identical content from main + control.  
- Add unique nonsense tokens (e.g., `#mellifluous-cactus-8271`).  
- Compare reach/visibility after 24h and 48h.  
- Log results in `visibility_tests.csv`.

### 5 — Minimise attack surfaces
- Disable auto contact-sync.  
- Turn off voice/mic access for non-essential apps.  
- Set profiles to private temporarily.

### 6 — Suppression request
Send a calm support message:  
> “On [date] my post/account appeared to have reduced visibility. Could you confirm if an automated action occurred, and the appeal route?”

### 7 — Backup & safe sharing
- Email `evidence_[date].zip` to a secondary trusted account.  
- Keep offline encrypted copy.
