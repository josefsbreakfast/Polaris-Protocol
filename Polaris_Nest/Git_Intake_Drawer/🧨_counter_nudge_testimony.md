*Personal account of how coercive nudging reshaped memory, trust, and recovery timelines.*

## ✦ Overview  
Nudges began as productivity tools, but once saturated with suppressive or contradictory signals, they forced an adaptive response: block them all out.  

- Positive prompts felt suspect.  
- Negative prompts felt relentless.  
- Self-blame became default (“I must have forgotten”).  

## ✦ Survivor Account  
> “I trained myself to ignore most nudges on electronic devices. Even when I did send the email, being told I hadn’t left me blaming myself. The survival tactic was to stop trusting prompts altogether. It looks like resilience. In truth it’s erosion.”  

Estimated recovery horizon:  
- 3–6 months for adrenaline/cortisol baseline to drop.  
- 1–2 years for deeper recalibration of trust in sensory & digital cues.
