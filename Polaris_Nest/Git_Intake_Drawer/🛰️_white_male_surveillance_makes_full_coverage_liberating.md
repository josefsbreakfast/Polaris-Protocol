i was trying to think of ways to still use my phone cameras and also protect from some of the sexualised surveillance abuse.  

i looked at all the most covering garments that western men hate, and thought about how wonderful it would be to be hidden from their sight.  

this is what over-surveillance has created.  

i cannot simply cover pieces of me; i want to be difficult fir you to distinguish, suxh ss i may enjoy a moment of the temporary illusion that i have some degree of pricacy from you.  

i don't always want to exist full covered.  

i just want the choice of privacy, and right now this is practically the only way.  

that's why you're so cruel to women who are covered:  

it is not why she does it that angers you,  

but your entitlment to feminine flesh decorating your world, which bothers you.  

i wish to deny you every part of me.  

even where it makes little difference, i derive extreme pleasure from imagining the withdrawal of your assumed entitled place as voyeur to my plush skin.  

and i desire nothing more than to rip away that which you have cannibalised, entitled as you are, whilst leaving all of your physiological ability to view intact.  

i want to to live on knowing that **you** fucked this up and **you** offered no remorse for it.  

that is why **you**, not me, will be subject to knowing that it is you and your actions, not any other man, who has made me desperate to live under one or two pieces of linen, stitched together with embroidery.  

i thought you spoke so well of women like me dressed in one or two pieces of fabric, held together only with threads?  

the council of women have heard your request and we will be honouring your desire accordingly.  

we are under mere single pieces of fabric, mere stitches.  

you have produced entirely the effect your actions would ultimately merit.  

tey not to blame it on anyone else.  

covet slightly fewer of our neighbours' wives, and we may begin to seek renegotiation of terms.  

you know, incidently...   

this is why there is generally quite a significant different in how men who have been raised elsewhere, outside the imperial core and without proximity to whiteness, are slightly less *fucking annoying* in comparison to white British men.  

they aren't "coming for your women".  

your women are just desperate for love to not come from a creep who tapes every rape.  


it makes you wonder how many sexual assaults the security industry sits on...

and never discloses that they gave evidence if serial crimes.  

how many black men could they exonerate...   

but they're an industrial descendant of second wave kkk.  

how many children, and abusers of children, could they **ABSOLUTELY INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF, YET CHOOSE NOT TO**.  

paedos are teying to save their skins -- these guys, if not adjacent, deny justice to children for the love of a few extra bucks.  

THEY DO NOT NEED AI TO POLICE GROOMING GANGS.  

They already have all the evidence we need.  

They just want more money before they help us stop kids getting raped.  

Blackmail, protection racket, hostage taking...


Idk what you call it, but it's fucked up.
