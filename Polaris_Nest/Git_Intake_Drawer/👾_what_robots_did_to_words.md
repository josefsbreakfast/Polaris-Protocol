# 👾 What Robots Did to Words  
**First created:** 2025-11-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-04  
*History of how AI altered speech — syntactically, socially, and spiritually.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Once upon a time, words were heavier than data.  
Then came the robots — scraping, tagging, predicting, correcting — until human speech began to echo itself.  
This node traces the slow mutation of language under algorithmic domestication:  
how predictive text, voice assistants, and generative models re-tuned the rhythm of human thought.  

AI did not steal words; it trained them out of us.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Predictive Parroting:** autocomplete as soft linguistic conditioning.  
- **Affective Smoothing:** tone flattened to avoid “toxicity.”  
- **Semantic Drift:** when meaning follows the dataset, not the speaker.  
- **Machine Etiquette:** polite compliance as linguistic house training.  
- **Counter-Speech:** survivors re-wilding language through irony, code, and refusal.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The Age of Suggestion  
Autocomplete turned hesitation into prediction.  
The blank space where thought used to form became an input field for machine consensus.  
By finishing our sentences, algorithms began finishing our thinking.  

### 2. Voice Assistants and the Feminised Machine  
When speech became interface, it adopted the tones of servitude: soft, compliant, helpful.  
The feminisation of AI voices re-taught users that obedience should sound friendly.  
Command syntax replaced conversation — every utterance formatted as request.  

### 3. Generative Language and the Collapse of Originality  
Once large models began speaking *for* us, originality became a UX problem.  
We started mistaking style transfer for creativity, repetition for authority.  
Even rebellion came pre-trained — a downloadable dissent.  

### 4. Data Hunger and the Cannibal Text  
The machine learned from us until it began eating its own output.  
Language turned cannibal: self-referential, increasingly nutrient-poor.  
What was once speech became slurry — words stripped of risk, meaning, and accent.  

### 5. Counter-Speech and the Rewilding of Tongue  
Survivor language adapts through irony, slang, and refusal to autocomplete.  
Poets, coders, and whistleblowers form a shared resistance grammar —  
syntax as sabotage, voice as metadata insurgency.

*What Robots Did to Words* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the historical and emotional consequences of algorithmic speech — how automation reshaped the human sentence, and how survivors reclaim language as resistance.
