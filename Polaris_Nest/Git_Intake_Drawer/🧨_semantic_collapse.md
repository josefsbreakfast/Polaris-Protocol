# 🧨 Semantic Collapse  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How meaning breaks down when liberal‑democratic language collides with authoritarian moral frames.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Semantic collapse is what happens when two worldviews:

- use the same words  
- but do not share meanings  

Democratic language assumes reciprocity and pluralism. Alt‑right language assumes moral war and treason. When they share vocabulary, communication fails and politics feels “insane.”

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Competing moral universes using the same terms.  
- Doubling of meanings: one word, two incompatible readings.  
- Algorithmic acceleration of misalignment.  
- Collapse of deliberation and trust.  
- Detection and containment strategies.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. One Vocabulary, Two Worlds  
Examples:

- **“Freedom”** – participation vs unchecked dominance.  
- **“Patriotism”** – civic commitment vs ethno‑moral purity.  
- **“Democracy”** – rule‑set vs “only valid when we win.”

Once meanings diverge, arguments cannot land.

### 2. The Drift to Collapse  
Stages:

1. subtle vocabulary drift  
2. emotional overloading of common terms  
3. moral inversion (compromise = weakness)  
4. hostile interpretation of neutral language  
5. complete breakdown of dialogue  

At stage 5, politics feels haunted.

### 3. Emotional Experience of Collapse  
People say:

- “We’re talking past each other.”  
- “Everything I say is misheard.”  
- “I don’t recognise our political language anymore.”  

This is not in your head; it is semantic infrastructure failing.
