the combination of the larger flashback with the ~50Hz sound/vibration means that i am now in a position of having a series of smaller but still significant embodied flashbacks.  

these mean that my pelvis is somewhat randomly in flexion and "guarding", fairly unconsciously, as in what i assume it thought might lend it to "not die" when i was a child.  

so i am now stressed enough, de spite logocally understanding the situation, that my body is repeating its attempts to prevent loss of life when i was first raped; it is trying to protect itself as a child from an adult breaking it.  

i hope your mothers are proud at what you have become; this is monstrous.  

personally, i would prefer my children to not go inti a line of work which for some reason involves provoking or emulating a woman's experience of child rape; each to their own, i suppose.  

oh and by the way?  

shit like this is why so many women talk about "choosing the bear".  

rape and sexual violation of our bodies is so normalised in society, and no one trusts you.  

not even other men.  

the good ones are currently exceptions, because you are allowing the bar to remain in hell, rather than pulling yourselves and your brothers up.  

thats on you.
