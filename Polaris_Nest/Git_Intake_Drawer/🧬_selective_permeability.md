*Don’t out-power the system; re-gate the flow.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
When interacting with high-capacity, high-reach actors online, direct confrontation amplifies their signal.  
Selective Permeability reframes resistance as **gating**, not blocking: allow only what sustains coherence and close the rest.  
It borrows from membrane biology—semi-permeable boundaries that sustain life by filtering, not sealing.

## 🧫 1. Membrane Logic  
Every cell survives by choosing what passes through.  
Absolute openness causes osmotic collapse; absolute closure causes starvation.  
Digital ecosystems follow the same rule.  
Permeability is a governance function: who crosses the threshold, how often, and by what transport mechanism.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Gating Types  
- **Mechanical Gates:** explicit barriers (moderation rules, queue systems, approval workflows).  
- **Electrical Gates:** mood or rhythm thresholds—access depends on tone, timing, and trust.  
- **Chemical Gates:** shared references, humour, or vocabulary that only compatible participants recognise.  

Together, these define your **operating membrane**.

## 💡 3. Energy Budget  
Each interaction costs ATP—attention, time, emotional glucose.  
Measure inputs by **metabolic expenditure**, not moral worth.  
If an exchange leaves depletion instead of curiosity, adjust gate thresholds.  
Sustainability is sovereignty.

## 🔄 4. Dynamic Re-Gating  
Permeability must evolve with conditions:  
- Tighten after spikes of noise.  
- Loosen during trust and growth phases.  
- Periodically recalibrate using reflection logs or community feedback.  
Living membranes adapt; brittle ones burst.

---

## 🪞 5. Transparent Filtering  
Ethical gating is visible, not secretive.  
State the boundary: “asynchronous replies,” “no urgent DMs,” “scope of moderation.”  
Transparency prevents gaslight; users can choose to stay or leave.  
This clarity converts boundary into pedagogy.

---

## 🧠 6. Avoiding Power Symmetry Traps  
Powerful actors thrive on symmetric struggle—every push creates counter-push.  
Asymmetry defuses the game:  
- Slow tempo.  
- Change format.  
- Re-route energy to long-form documentation.  
When you refuse mirrored escalation, their amplification loops break.

## 🧩 7. Re-Gating Checklist  
✅ Do I understand my current membrane shape (open/closed)?  
✅ What energy do I lose per interaction?  
✅ Which gates need automation?  
✅ What should stay purely manual (human empathy)?  
✅ When did I last re-calibrate thresholds?
