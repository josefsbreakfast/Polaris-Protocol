*How democratic systems preserve self-image by exporting ethically corrosive actions beyond visible accountability.*

## 🧭 What this node is
This node explains **why democracies repeatedly externalise morally hazardous activity** rather than confront it internally.

It is not a claim about hypocrisy or bad faith.  
It is an analysis of **system self-preservation under moral stress**.

---

## 🧱 Moral risk (defined)
Moral risk arises where actions:

- are legally ambiguous but ethically corrosive,
- contradict stated values,
- produce foreseeable civilian harm,
- or require permanent exception to ordinary norms.

Democracies do not eliminate moral risk.  
They **manage where it lands**.

---

## 🔄 The outsourcing logic
Democracies outsource moral risk when:

- action is seen as necessary,
- accountability is politically costly,
- and visibility threatens legitimacy.

Outsourcing occurs by:
- partnering with allies,
- delegating to intelligence systems,
- relying on private actors,
- shifting activity offshore,
- or embedding harm in “support” roles.

Responsibility diffuses.  
Outcomes persist.

---

## 🌍 Why allies and liminal zones are used
Outsourcing favours spaces that are:

- geopolitically aligned,
- legally exceptional,
- operationally opaque,
- and rhetorically defensible.

These zones allow democracies to say:
- “we did not decide,”
- “we did not execute,”
- “we are monitoring,”
- “we are reviewing.”

The harm occurs anyway.

---

## 🧠 The self-image problem
Democracies depend on:
- legal credibility,
- moral distinction,
- and public trust.

Directly owning morally corrosive acts:
- fractures that image,
- destabilises coalitions,
- and triggers institutional backlash.

Outsourcing allows the system to:
- preserve identity,
- while displacing consequence.

This is not unique to any one country.

---

## ⚖️ Law as ambience
When moral risk is outsourced:

- law becomes procedural,
- courts lag events,
- committees record rather than interrupt,
- and legality becomes a shield rather than a brake.

Compliance replaces care.  
Process replaces prevention.

---

## 🧩 How the Gaza case fits
The Gaza period illustrates this pattern clearly:

- extreme harm was foreseeable,
- intervention was politically costly,
- prevention was displaced into review,
- and responsibility was diffused across systems.

The outsourcing was not secret.  
It was **structural**.

---

## 🧯 Who pays the cost
Outsourcing moral risk harms:

- civilians subjected to violence,
- partner force personnel trapped in escalation,
- analysts and civil servants carrying moral injury,
- and the democratic system’s long-term credibility.

The system survives the moment.  
The damage accumulates.

---

## 🧷 Working claim
Democracies do not fail because they abandon values.

They fail because they **export the cost of violating them**.

Unless moral risk is brought back inside:
- through refusal,
- interruption,
- and visible accountability,

prevention regimes will continue to exist only on paper.

*Why democracies outsource moral risk* is the synthesis node of the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to explain why well-intentioned systems repeatedly reproduce preventable harm — and why restoring integrity requires pulling moral risk back into the space of decision, not managing it at a distance.
