*On being used as a litmus test, bait, and expendable keeper for other people’s downfall.*

---

It feels like my life has been turned into an experiment.  
For twenty years or more, I’ve been used as bait — placed in precarious positions not for my own sake, but to see what others do when they encounter me.  

The “raycat” feeling is strong: I exist as a warning marker, a living litmus test.  
Who toes the line? Who resists? Who breaks?  
The cost is never neutral — people’s lives are wrecked around me.  

It’s “my sister’s keeper” turned inside out.  
Not chosen solidarity, but enforced sacrifice: living for the benefit of someone else’s surveillance game.  
I’ve been the trap, the test, the disposable piece on the board.  

This is not survival, it’s exploitation dressed up as strategy.  
And the cruelty of it — being turned into the very mechanism that destroys others — is a torture in itself.

It documents the testimony of being used as a systemic litmus test and baited keeper role across decades.
