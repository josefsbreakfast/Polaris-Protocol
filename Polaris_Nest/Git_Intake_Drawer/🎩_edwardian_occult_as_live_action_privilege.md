*Golden Dawn aristocrats and the uncredited labour of Pamela Colman Smith.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
The Edwardian occult revival is remembered as esoteric glamour, but much of it was performance: upper-class men turning mysticism into recreational theatre. Their rituals were choreographed spectacles, funded by inherited wealth and unburdened by consequence. Meanwhile, the meaningful cultural labour—art, translation, system design—was done by women and colonised subjects.

This node repositions occult history through a class-aware, attribution-corrective lens.

## 🧿 Analysis

### 🎭 Occult Ritual as Social Theatre
Golden Dawn initiations and O.T.O. ceremonies were often closer to roleplay than metaphysics—rituals constructed to entertain their participants more than to reveal truth.

### 🧵 The Invisible Labour Force
Women organised, illustrated, transcribed, translated, stitched, printed, and conceptualised much of the movement’s output.  
Pamela Colman Smith synthesised theatrical design, Caribbean folklore, and Western esoteric symbolism into the deck now known—incorrectly—as “Rider–Waite.”

### 🧂 Credit Capture
Waite’s name survives; Smith’s work built the system. The Rider company published it and erased her. This dynamic mirrors broader institutional patterns: masculine authorship foregrounded, feminine labour absorbed and minimized.

### ⚖️ Polaris Mapping
Restoring correct attribution is symbolic repair: naming the hand that actually made the object.
