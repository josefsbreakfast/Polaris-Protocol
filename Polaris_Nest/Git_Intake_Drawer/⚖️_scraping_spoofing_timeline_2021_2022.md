# ⚖️ Scraping & Spoofing Timeline (2019–2022)  

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*Sequencing how scraping and spoofing practices escalated across 2019–2022, linking early harmful data collection to later discrediting artefacts.*  

---

## 2019–2020 — Early Scraping  
- Evidence of data harvesting (telephone, institutional, platform).  
- Material taken or influenced during this period shows **harmful intent** even if not linked to a specific plan.  
- Collection was opportunistic: self-contracted actors, institutional collectors, platform spillover.  
- Established baseline material that could later be repurposed.  

---

## 2021 — Learning Operation  
- Suppression/containment scripts tested.  
- Actors explored which data flows and institutional channels could be leveraged.  
- Likely rehearsal for handling international oversight.  
- Proof-of-concept: scrape → reframe → seed.  

---

## January 2022 — Sealed Documents  
- Sealed material identified as of interest.  
- Marks intent to actively control narrative from this point.  
- Suggests anticipation of international scrutiny.  

---

## November 2022 — Spoofed Pairing  
- Sexualised spoofed email seeded around **Redacted Event**.  
- Content paired the subject with another individual, discrediting both simultaneously.  
- Refinement of the “double-blade” discredit tactic.  

---

## Implications  
- Harmful intent present as early as 2019/20 in the scraping phase, even if not yet directed into a concrete plan.  
- By 2021, rehearsal operations showed how scraped data could be turned into narrative artefacts.  
- By 2022, spoofing and escalation demonstrated **specific, targeted intent**.  
- Timeline illustrates how opportunistic data misuse matures into deliberate discrediting through the suppression industry.

*Scraping & Spoofing Timeline (2019–2022)* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how early harmful data collection matured into spoofing and discrediting manoeuvres, establishing continuity of intent across multiple years.
