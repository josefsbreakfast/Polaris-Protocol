# ⚖️ Scraping & Spoofing Timeline (2021–2022)  

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*Sequencing how scraping and spoofing practices escalated across 2021–2022, linking precursor operations to later discrediting artefacts.*  

---

## 2021 — Learning Operation  
- Early suppression/containment scripts tested.  
- Actors appear to map: what data flows, what institutional channels, and what international oversight would need to be managed.  
- Established proof-of-concept: scrape → reframe → seed.  

---

## January 2022 — Sealed Documents  
- Sealed material becomes a point of interest.  
- Strong indicator of intent to control narrative from this date at the latest.  
- Suggests that actors anticipated international scrutiny.  

---

## November 2022 — Spoofed Pairing  
- Sexualised spoofed email seeded around **Redacted Event**.  
- Content paired the subject with another individual, discrediting both simultaneously.  
- Signals refinement of the “double-blade” discredit tactic.  

---

## Implications  
- Timeline shows continuity of intent from 2021 → 2022.  
- Each phase adds layers of legitimacy: from “learning op” to sealed-doc interest to full spoof pairing.  
- Demonstrates how scrapers and spoofers operate as an **industry loop**, not as a single conspiracy.
