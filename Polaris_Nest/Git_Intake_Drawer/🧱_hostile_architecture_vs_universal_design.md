*How control-driven design codes reproduce exclusion and exhaustion.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Benches with spikes, cold ledges, anti-sleeping rails — hostile architecture literalises contempt.  
Universal Design, by contrast, begins from **shared use**: the assumption that difference is normal, not deviant.  
Between them lies a moral index of who a city thinks belongs.

## 🔍 Notes for Expansion  

- Hostile architecture as policy instrument (anti-loitering, class policing).  
- Universal Design origins in disability activism and post-war rehabilitation.  
- How austerity repurposed “safety” language to justify exclusion.  
- Design justice movements and counter-mapping projects.
