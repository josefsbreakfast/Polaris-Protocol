## 🧭 Orientation  
In the film’s final act, the dictator’s broadcast cuts out for only a few minutes.  
The armed ranks waiting outside Parliament hesitate; then they lower their rifles.  
What might have been a massacre dissolves into quiet.  
The regime collapses not through victory or defeat, but through a sudden failure of sound.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Signal Failure as Liberation** — the disappearance of the commanding voice reveals individual agency.  
- **Collective Moral Reflex** — people choose, almost simultaneously, not to enact violence.  
- **Symbolic Violence** — destruction redirected from bodies to a building; spectacle replacing slaughter.  
- **Plausible Humanity** — the moment feels believable because it mirrors how hesitation actually works in groups.

## 🔍 Analysis  
Every authoritarian system depends on continuous, coordinated speech.  
Orders become obedience through rhythm and repetition; silence interrupts that rhythm.  
When the chain of command loses its tone—even briefly—people rediscover the option to pause.  
In *V for Vendetta*, that pause saves lives.  
The story becomes a study in **de-escalation by absence**, an inversion of propaganda’s constant noise.

The ending’s realism lies not in physics but in psychology: most violence requires permission.  
Remove the voice that grants it, and a crowd remembers its own restraint.

*🎙 The Silence After Command* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It examines how the withdrawal of a commanding voice can collapse systemic violence into symbolic release.
