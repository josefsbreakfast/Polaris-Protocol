## 💄 Dramatis Personae  

| Character | Role in the episode | Catch-phrase |
|------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Dr Cipher Byte** | Evil-genius IT villain in a leather cardigan | “No one will ever find the logs!” |
| **The Audit Log** | Sentient compliance record; speaks only in UTC timestamps | “At 03:07:44 Z, you did WHAT?” |
| **The SOC 2 Scooby Gang** | DPO, sysadmin & two interns with clipboards | “Let’s split up and check the access tokens!” |
| **The Cloud** | Eternal witness in the sky | *[ominous humming of redundant backups]* |

## 🎬 Cold Open  

INT. UNIVERSITY DATA CENTRE — NIGHT.  
Lightning. Leather cardigan. Sinister typing.  
> “Tonight I shall rewrite reality! Every grade, every payroll — *mine!*”  

He hits *Enter.*   
Eighty-four replicas politely disagree.

## 💾 The Audit Log Awakens  

From /var/log comes a growl.  
> **AUDIT LOG:** “Unauthorized write detected.”  
> **DR BYTE:** “You can’t talk — you’re a system file!”  
> **AUDIT LOG:** “Error: false.”

## 👻 Why the Villain Always Loses  

*Because the Admin is never The Villain.*  
*Too busy fixing the printer after the COO touched it.*

| Evil Plan | Cartoon Reality Check | Who Rats Them Out |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| “I’ll delete the logs.” | They’re append-only. | Immutable Storage Bucket. |
| “I’ll spoof the user.” | Device fingerprints disagree. | The SIEM that never sleeps. |
| “I’ll change the timestamps.” | NTP laughs in synchronised derision. | The Time Server. |
| “I’ll corrupt the backups.” | Cross-region replication says no. | Cloud Compliance Officer. |
| “I’ll erase all evidence.” | Off-site archives raise one eyebrow. | The Intern with Excel skills. |

## 🧠 Reveal Scene  

> **DPO:** “Let’s see who you really are!”  
> *(Pulls off leather cardigan.)*  
> **DPO:** “It’s just another change request without approval!”  
> **Dr Byte:** “And I would’ve gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling compliance officers!”  

The Audit Log updates the ticket and closes it as *Resolved – User Error.*

## 🌈 Epilogue  

Press release: “No personal data were harmed in the making of this breach.”  
The Audit Log sips black coffee and hums a checksum.
