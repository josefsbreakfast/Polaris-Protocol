# 🪼 Who Is Acting?
**First created:** 2025-12-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-18  
*Tracing authority, agency, and attribution under conditions of information war and peacetime law.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node addresses a persistent governance ambiguity: **who is acting, under what authority, and for whose interests**, when information activity escalates in a formally peacetime state amid high-intensity conflict narratives. It does not allege wrongdoing. It maps **attribution fog**—the conditions under which cause, mandate, and responsibility become hard to distinguish.

---

## 🧭 The Core Clash (Frames In Collision)  
- **War framing vs. credible genocide framing** (with credibility grounded in international judicial signals, not rhetoric).  
- Frame choice alters what counts as:
  - legitimate speech,
  - journalism,
  - intelligence,
  - disinformation,
  - extremism,
  - or state-protective action.

**Result:** legitimacy regimes diverge while actors operate in the same public space.

---

## ⚖️ Peacetime Law, Wartime Pressure  
- The UK remains **formally in peacetime**, yet information practices reflect wartime intensity.  
- This produces a **grey zone** where:
  - enforcement feels exceptional,
  - explanation remains ordinary or opaque,
  - and accountability pathways lag operational reality.

---

## 🧩 Category Blur (Where Boundaries Fray)  
- **Journalism ↔ OSINT ↔ Intelligence-shaped activity**  
- **Political organisation ↔ Security risk ↔ Terrorism thresholds**  
- **Public interest ↔ National interest (“British interests”)**

These are not purely legal confusions; they are **operational and communicative** confusions that shape action before doctrine catches up.

---

## 🕸️ Stakeholder Field (Non-Exhaustive)  
- Individuals and collectives  
- Journalists and independent investigators  
- NGOs and advocacy groups  
- Policy organisations and think tanks  
- Vendors, contractors, analytics providers  
- Government departments and agencies  
- Private actors (risk, reputation, finance)

**Key point:** actions may occur **near** state power without being state-directed.

---

## 🧠 Attribution Fog: Why Cause Is Hard To See  
- **Ecosystem proximity:** small ponds, dense networks, fast circulation of risk signals.  
- **Defensive behaviour:** vendors/contractors pause or alter activity pre-emptively.  
- **Language shields:** “PR,” “comms,” and “stakeholder management” obscure information operations.  
- **Process gaps:** KPI/outcome focus eclipses lifecycle accountability.

---

## 🪼 Unknown Variables (Marking What Must Be Excluded, Not Asserted)  
- **Unknown variable:** Which frame (war vs. credible genocide) is operationally dominant for which actors.  
- **Unknown variable:** Where peacetime authority ends and security exception begins in practice.  
- **Unknown variable:** When journalism/OSINT crosses an enforced—but unexplained—threshold.  
- **Unknown variable:** Which actions are state-mandated versus contractor- or vendor-adjacent.  
- **Unknown variable:** How “British interests” are being defined and prioritised at any given moment.

---

## 🧯 Governance Implications  
- **Absolute denials without process transparency** increase distrust under ambiguity.  
- **Lifecycle governance** (generation → transient existence → deletion) matters more than possession.  
- **Training debt** accumulates when staff import assumptions from other sectors.  
- **Bipartisan vulnerability:** these gaps recur across ideological lines.

---

## 🧪 What Reduces the Fog (Non-Accusatory)  
- Clear articulation of **search scope and process**, not just outcomes.  
- Public explanations of **category boundaries** during prolonged conflicts.  
- Explicit handling of **vendor/contractor responsibility** “on behalf of” controllers.  
- Separation of **data harm**, **democratic harm**, and **narrative harm** in oversight.

*🪼 Who Is Acting?* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It maps attribution ambiguity to support governance clarity without presuming intent.
