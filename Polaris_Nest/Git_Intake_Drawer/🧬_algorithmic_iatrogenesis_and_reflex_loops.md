## 💉 Algorithmic Iatrogenesis — When Platforms Chase the Numbers  

In medicine, “chasing the numbers” describes what happens when a clinician treats a chart instead of a person.  
Focus drifts from how the patient is *actually doing* to whether their readings look “normal.”  
The same pathology drives today’s information systems.

Algorithms don’t see meaning — only engagement.  
They cannot tell the difference between admiration, rage, or voyeurism; they only detect spikes.  
When a woman’s public post begins attracting coordinated traffic, the system interprets the noise as relevance and starts reinforcing it.  
Each click, whether hate or curiosity, becomes evidence of “interest.”  

The result is a digital iatrogenic injury:  
the cure (optimisation) makes the patient (the information environment) sicker.  
Platform logic treats engagement like oxygen saturation — it must be kept high — even if what’s actually circulating is poison.  

Defamation, pornographic deepfakes, and outrage bait are not random by-products; they are the **side effects of algorithmic over-medication**.  
The system over-corrects for engagement, ignores the person, and compounds the harm.  
Like a mis-titrated drug, the intervention creates its own pathology.

## 🧬 Reflex Loops — When the System Confesses  

If you watch long enough, the machinery of harassment begins to tell on itself.  
Each attempt at suppression leaves a diagnostic trace.  
A single search result can read like an x-ray of the attacker’s intent.

Example:  
1. A reflective post on language and communal caretaking.  
2. A note observing that *people tell on themselves*.  
3. Pornographic defamation attached to the same legal name.  

Three entries, one confession: **investment → anxiety → sexualised punishment.**  
The cluster itself reveals the ideological circuitry — who felt threatened, what they wanted to hide, and how they chose to retaliate.  

This is what a self-referential system looks like under pressure.  
The harder it tries to discredit the subject, the more precisely it maps its own obsessions.  
Every smear becomes a breadcrumb; every spike of engagement an admission of guilt.  
In forensic terms, the contamination *is the evidence.*

## 🧭 System Response — Interrupting the Loop  

A system that injures itself can still recover, but only if it understands its own physiology.  
The cure for algorithmic iatrogenesis is not more automation; it is **clinical literacy** about how harm circulates through data.  
Each actor in the network — platform, regulator, researcher, user — holds a part of the antidote.

### 🏥 1. Platforms — Stop Treating Engagement as a Vital Sign  
- Replace *engagement = health* with *integrity = health.*  
- Audit ranking algorithms for **iatrogenic side effects**: correlation between outrage spikes and harassment clusters.  
- Treat coordinated defamation as **systemic infection**, not user error.  
- Embed slow-review pathways that favour context over speed.  
- Publish “harm discharge summaries” — transparent reports on containment decisions and their downstream impacts.

### ⚖️ 2. Regulators — Diagnose by Pattern, Not by Case  
- Move beyond single-incident moderation complaints.  
- Investigate **repeat contagion routes** — the same networks re-appearing around different targets.  
- Require searchable transparency of **advertiser adjacency** to harassment content.  
- Frame digital harm under **duty-of-care statutes**, not just speech law; the issue is operational design, not opinion.

### 🧩 3. Researchers — Trace Reflex Loops as Data Artefacts  
- Build open-access taxonomies of **reflexive confession patterns** (the way attackers replicate their anxieties).  
- Use metadata forensics to identify when harassment becomes **policy rehearsal** — the pre-legislative stage of authoritarianism.  
- Co-produce analysis with survivors; they recognise the signatures first.  
- Record undertone faithfully: tone is diagnostic data.

### 🫱 4. Users & Witnesses — Practise Counter-Measurement  
- Refuse to feed the metric. Do not quote-tweet rage bait.  
- Capture screenshots and timestamps; **don’t** try to “fight” the algorithm in real time.  
- Use “metadata judo”: annotate your own posts so that context travels with the content.  
- Report patterns collectively — many small reports mapping the same behaviour expose the architecture faster than one viral call-out.

### 🌱 5. Democratic Immunity — Build Redundancy Into the Information Body  
- Fund independent **digital pathology units** within journalism and academia.  
- Treat survivor testimony as infrastructure, not anecdote.  
- Archive incidents longitudinally; healing comes from pattern recognition.  
- Teach the public how to read *the numbers as symptoms*, not truth.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🧬 Algorithmic Iatrogenesis and Reflex Loops* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces how optimisation systems convert harassment into infrastructure — and how those same systems ultimately confess their design through over-correction.  
The node bridges clinical metaphor and civic diagnosis: digital pathology as democratic defence.
