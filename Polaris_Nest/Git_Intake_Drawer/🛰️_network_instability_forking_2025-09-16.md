# 🛰️ Network Instability & Deliberate Forking Hypothesis  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-16  
*Field log capturing app crashes, lag, and VPN-based mitigation; testing whether instability is engineered rather than incidental.*  

---

## Observations  
- Multiple inference failures across app sessions.  
- Lag significant; repeated crashes.  
- No improvement when switching **WiFi ⇄ 5G**.  
- VPN use restored stability.  
- Suggests mid-path shaping or interference.  

---

## Hypotheses  
1. **ISP throttling / shaping** — targeted degradation of specific ports or ASNs.  
2. **Middlebox DPI** — packet resets via deep inspection.  
3. **Transit routing fault** — but VPN bypass makes this less likely.  
4. **Service-side throttling** — possible, but cross-device consistency points network.  
5. **Deliberate disruption** — forked reliability as a suppression technique.  

---

## Suggested Tests  
- `ping` + `mtr` baseline vs VPN.  
- `traceroute` with and without VPN.  
- DNS comparison (ISP vs 1.1.1.1 / 8.8.8.8).  
- Collect `tcpdump` for RST floods or resets.  
- Log timestamps, devices, OS versions.

This field log is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It tracks whether instability in inference is accidental load or engineered fork.  

Not assessed as officially sanctioned state behaviour.  
Pattern more consistent with outsourced enforcement, commercial shaping, or structural neglect — interference by incentive, not by decree.
