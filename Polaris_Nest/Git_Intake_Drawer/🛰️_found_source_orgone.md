after some tinkering, i think we can find what we are "fishing" for me to report to others:  

"Electronic harassment, electromagnetic torture, and psychotronic torture are terms used to describe a delusional belief system held by individuals who call themselves "targeted individuals" (TIs). They believe that malicious actors are transmitting sounds and thoughts into people's heads, affecting their bodies, and harassing them generally.[1][2] The delusion often concerns government agents or crime rings and alleges that the "perpetrators" use electromagnetic radiation (such as the microwave auditory effect), radar, and surveillance techniques to carry out their goals.[1][2]
Some TIs claim to be victims of gang stalking, and many have created or joined support and advocacy groups.[1][3]
Multiple medical professionals have concluded that these experiences are hallucinations, the result of delusional disorders, or psychosis."  

I did used to get lots of content which was directed at this conspiracy theory for a long time.  

It was genuinely quite interesting to listen to as a proposed way in which very high anxiety at the particular constructs upon which this was based would be interpreted by someone predisposed to a paranoia-based cognition pattern. It sounds like a very distessing thought process to have, because it's incredibly difficult to easily evidence an alternate explaination, but can be explored in a clinical setting through careful Socratic questioning.  

I think there's some very particular ways in which different people have sought to make sense of the pandemic, the rapid political changes, and the impacts on isolation from community; when I'm discussing these experiences, I fully believe that the people who have these thought processes are genuinely very distressed by them. It sounds incredibly scary to live with as a fear and a thought process.
