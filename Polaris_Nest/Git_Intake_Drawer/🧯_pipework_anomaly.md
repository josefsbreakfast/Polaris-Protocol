The interference is so samey now:  


# 🧯 *Field Log — “Pipework Anomaly” (Deputyship Capture Reflection)*  
**Date logged:** *2025-10-11*  
**Linked case:** *KKL Executor & Trustee Co Ltd v Harrison [2020] EWCOP 25*  
**Node type:** *Observation / Process reflection*  
**Related clusters:** *Charitable Capture · Governance & Containment · Allies & Ethics*

## 🛰️ *Observation Context*  
While finalising the SOP-compliant node for *KKL v Harrison*, it became apparent that the procedural record read less like an impersonal bureaucratic misfire and more like a deliberate interface between *private interest and institutional design*.  
The metaphor that surfaced — *“humans sticking their dicks in the pipework”* — captured, in crude but accurate shorthand, the feeling that what appears as *systemic friction* often stems from *intentional manual interference* disguised as neutral process.

## 🔧 *Observed Dynamics*  
- **Human insertion into machine logic:**  
  The deputyship framework presents as administrative, yet human bias re-enters at every decision junction — who drafts, who witnesses, who “cares.”  

- **Conflict disguised as competence:**  
  Institutional actors claim procedural authority to mask financial or reputational interest.  

- **Audit illusion:**  
  Oversight mechanisms (e.g., cost assessments, referral schemes) give a sense of closure while leaving underlying conflict structures intact.  

- **Language drift:**  
  Terms like “best interests” and “pastoral care” act as lubricant — smoothing human interference into the pipes of legality.

## 🧠 *Interpretive Notes*  
This moment underscores the *Polaris premise*: malfunction is rarely mechanical.  
Wherever “error” recurs predictably, someone is routing pressure through a covert valve — repurposing bureaucracy as infrastructure for extraction.  
The vulgar metaphor holds forensic precision: it identifies **the point of biological intrusion into systemic architecture**.

## 🪞 *Polaris Reading*  
- *Machine error is the alibi of design.*  
- Each time a process “fails cleanly,” check for who benefits from the blockage.  
- In deputyship and charity governance, *conflict is a feature disguised as fiduciary care.*

## 🌒 *Stardust*  
- Consider formalising *“Pipework Interference Index”* as a tagging schema for nodes exposing manual capture within supposedly mechanical governance.  
- Possible inclusion in *Charitable Capture* mini-series (paired with *Money Listens* and *Allies & Ethics*).
