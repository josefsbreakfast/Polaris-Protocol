# 😶‍🌫 Institutional Freeze–Fog–Correction Cycle  
**First created:** 2025-11-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*A Polaris governance node mapping the three-stage emotional–procedural response institutions move through when internal harm is revealed.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
When an organisation realises it may have caused harm, it rarely responds cleanly or quickly.  
Instead, institutions move through a **predictable three-phase cycle**:

1. **Freeze** — immediate paralysis  
2. **Fog** — confusion, re-checking, internal misalignment  
3. **Correction** — action, acknowledgment, repair  

This node explains the mechanics, psychology, and governance logic of the cycle.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Defines the three-stage institutional response model  
- Bridges emotional and procedural factors  
- Explains why survivors experience long silences  
- Shows how the cycle resolves into corrective action  
- Complements the Silence-Harm & Acknowledgment Delay node

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

## 1. Phase One — **Freeze**  
The instant an organisation detects internal harm, it freezes.  
Freeze is driven by:

- emotional shock  
- fear of reputational damage  
- fear of legal liability  
- disbelief that harm occurred  
- loyalty bias (“not our colleague…?”)  
- fear of acting on incomplete information  

**Behavioural signs:**  
- silence  
- non-committal emails  
- sudden formality  
- internal huddles  
- stalled requests  
- avoidance of statements  

Freeze is not the final answer — it is the opening paralysis.

---

## 2. Phase Two — **Fog**  
Fog is the *messiest* stage.

The institution attempts to work out:

- what actually happened  
- who was involved  
- where the error originated  
- whether harm is real or perceived  
- whether disclosure is required  
- whether multiple silos disagree  
- whether reputational exposure is imminent  

Fog produces contradictory behaviours:

- some teams escalate  
- some minimise  
- some seek consensus  
- some delay out of fear  
- some assume others are handling it  

Survivors experience Fog as:  
**incoherence, abandonment, and panic-inducing uncertainty.**

---

## 3. Why Fog Takes So Long  
Fog must resolve four internal tensions:

1. **Emotional tension**  
   Shock, embarrassment, and shame all cloud judgment.

2. **Procedural tension**  
   Systems disagree on facts, timelines, and categories.

3. **Hierarchical tension**  
   Senior leaders often delay decisions until the picture stabilises.

4. **Liability tension**  
   Legal instincts suppress early acknowledgment.

Only when these tensions relax does correction begin.

---

## 4. Phase Three — **Correction**  
Correction begins once:

- the narrative stabilises  
- embarrassment cools  
- legal risk is bounded  
- internal alignment is achieved  
- decision-makers understand the scope  
- moral pressure outweighs silence  

Correction includes:

- acknowledgment  
- record correction  
- regulatory notifications  
- direct communication with the harmed person  
- organisational learning  
- process redesign  
- safeguarding reviews  

Correction often arrives **suddenly**, after weeks or months of stillness.

---

## 5. Why Survivors Are Months Ahead  
Survivors experience the harm *directly*.  
Institutions experience it *indirectly* and *emotionally*.

This produces a fundamental time-gap:  
- survivors see the entire pattern  
- institutions see fragments  
- survivors speak plainly  
- institutions hesitate  

The Freeze–Fog–Correction cycle explains this gap without framing survivors as “escalatory” or institutions as “malicious.”

---

## 6. How to Interpret the Cycle Practically  
Freeze tells you: **people are shocked**  
Fog tells you: **people are confused**  
Correction tells you: **alignment has finally occurred**

The cycle always feels worse to the survivor than to the institution.  
But once in Correction, things progress rapidly.

*Institutional Freeze–Fog–Correction Cycle* is a core Polaris diagnostic node describing the predictable progression institutions undergo after discovering internal harm.  
It stabilises survivor expectations and clarifies organisational behaviour.
