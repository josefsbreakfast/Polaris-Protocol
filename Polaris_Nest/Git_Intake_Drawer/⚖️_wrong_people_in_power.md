*Why suppression operations persist when the authorising class is compromised or unwilling.*  

---

## Situation  
- Suppression operations seeded in past decades are now mature.  
- At least two major powers are impacted.  
- Oversight bodies reluctant to act because:  
  - They are themselves implicated.  
  - They still rely on suppression tools.  
  - They fear political fallout.  

---

## Problems of Will  
- Refusal to disclose holdings.  
- Reluctance to process sensitive data.  
- Refusal to unwind tools still in use.  
- Political investment in maintaining cover.

*Wrong People in Power* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how suppression operations are sustained by political actors who benefit from stalemate.
