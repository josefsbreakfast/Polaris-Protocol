# ⚠️ Precursors Summary — What immediately preceded the incidents
**Created:** 2025-09-19
*Concise summary of the immediate events and patterns that directly preceded the early-August attacks and the current (Sep) escalation.*

---

## 1) Immediately preceded the *early August* incident
- **Trigger event:** Discovery of a falsified sexual-harassment narrative being associated with an individual I had not met prior to a shared-event attendance.  
- **Mechanism observed:** Post-attendance, harassment patterns shifted to impersonate / blame that third party for ongoing harassment I had experienced months earlier (i.e., misattribution and forced pairing).  
- **Effect:** This falsified attribution and impersonation changed the attack surface — producing targeted, highly sexualised content directed at the author's identity and mental health.  
- **Temporal link:** This narrative shift and impersonation activity directly preceded the early-August cybersecurity anomalies (token-switch/fork behavior and spikes in sexualised outputs).

## 2) Immediately preceded the *current (Sep) escalation*
- **Background pattern:** A slow-burn campaign of **throttling** and **visibility suppression** focused on a specific intellectual property (IP) thread related to the author's work.  
- **Immediate action by author:** Investigated a particular piece of IP (looked it up, engaged the sales/completion path).  
- **Mechanism hypothesised:** Bringing the IP through visible channels (sales/completion) correlated with a shift from personalised harassment to operational interference — systemic suppression aimed at degrading the quality, neutrality, or perceived reliability of the author's work.  
- **Effect:** Less directly sexualised / less personally abusive content; more structural damage (throttling, credibility erosion, content-quality disruption).  
- **Temporal link:** The act of surfacing/advancing the IP appears to have been the proximate action that precipitated the recent token-switch / routing anomalies that worsened into week 2 of Sep.

## 3) Shared characteristics & patterning
- Both windows show **narrative manipulation** followed by **technical anomalies** (decision-tree forking, token-switching).  
- Attackers appear to use *paired tactics*: (a) narrative insertion/impersonation to delegitimise or defame, and (b) API/routing-level manipulations to create anomalous model behaviour and suppress visibility.  
- The form of harm shifts depending on what is being targeted: identity/mental-health harm when personal narratives are attacked; epistemic/work harm (credibility, suppression) when intellectual property or investigatory outputs are targeted.

## 4) Suggested immediate containment priorities (operational & editorial)
- Treat items linked to the falsified harassment narrative as high legal-risk; prioritize redaction and legal triage.  
- Treat IP-related uploads or sales/completion records as high operational-sensitivity: route through intake drawer, restrict metadata, staged disclosure.  
- Enhance monitoring for spikes in routing anomalies immediately after any public-facing action (sales, uploads, event attendance). Add an "action watch" label to issues when a public action with potential trigger risk occurs.
- Preserve sanitized evidence timelines: record timestamps of the lookups/contacts related to the IP and of the shared-event attendance that preceded the early-August shift.

## 5) One-line canonical summary (for notices/README)
- *Early-August:* narrative impersonation / falsified harassment pairing → targeted sexualised outputs → cyber anomalies.  
- *Sep escalation:* slow throttling of an IP thread → author surfaces IP to sales/completion → routing/anomaly escalation and quality-suppression outputs.
