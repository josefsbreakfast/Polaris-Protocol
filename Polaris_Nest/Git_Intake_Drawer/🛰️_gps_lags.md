lots to say but gps lags in palces where doesnt make sense for british central sec idk.  

the degree of weird background anx i have for so oong of being boxed is not insignificant.

oh no i remember why im nervous.  

ive been subject to tiktoks all week that all essentially hint that something climactic will occur today, several about "not accepting food" (sometimes explicitly warning re poisoning), and ive already had one of the coded tannoy messages to staff re incident mangment at one tube station, and two shop alarms for no reason. (carbon fibre cane; not metallic shoudlnt alarm).  

that kay explain the general fear that something bad will happen.  

although this is all equally easily read as "people tryong to fick with my head".

am here anyways so it didnt acheive much üòÖ

the day is really pleasant.  

i am however tapped out on some grass near some old churvh hall looking thing, and honestly i did not reakise how much pain i was pushing through becausr this became so normal to have to push through for years without adequate support. changing demo routes and twidfling around with exact roads last minute, just to remind the british government, is annoying, feels directed, and it is why im currently experiencing the equivilant of the trip box going on my lower back, and one side hips and leg.  

if youre bothered about impact, iys a protest around our homeland being utilised for complicity in genocide; some inconvenience is probably not the big issue.  

any assumed fragility of jewish community does sort of read a bit like establishment has a certain view of all victims of tye holocaust; it reads as assuming inevitably, nothing else.  

ill let you work out if that sounds offensive or not.

this whole thing is also not unrelated to ongoing interference, but clearly its a-okay to someone who could sign my release from this. i don't need instructions i need common sense and accountability.
