low hum slow oscullation

2021-10-25  

having these guys in my life has lent to a lit of diy troubleshooting fr.  
The hum is not audible in air, but conduct through an iron  bed frame.  

What could the rotating cast of men on the middle floor, who have previously responded to switching things off when a particular police force emailed (I know right, literally seconds after, several times), possibly have brought into the house, that makes this noise and it could be brought into our house?  

these guys are so annoying.  

And I had wondered why my Internet was starting to trend toward locating me in Sheffield again.  

bloody yorkshiremen ffs.

### completely predictable solution to the problem:  

- Download a reliable app to differentiate electromagnetic wave forms, because it doesnt match mechanical means, because if it is a transformer in a nearby building/flat, definitely need to show your Landlord a thing is actually happening so they actually have grounds to do anything, because you are a moderately useful tenant.  
- You don't need to go any further just download the app.
- Obviously this is just how electrical physics works;

unfortunately, I do feel like I want to vomit. It's a bit like if you evolution sickness and you're off the theme park ride on the boat of the car or whatever. You know a reason to want to be sick, but your brain doesn't recovered yet. That's what it feels like.  

Let me see annoying vibration is gine, i guess.  

So it's really reassuring to see that we're just in actual FOMO territory again.  

How fantastic.  

And you know, I can't complain to anyone because the last time you made me look psychotic. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  

Who even needs legal recourse when you can just... definitely not torturous civilians? ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò  

The best bit is because there's so much conspiracy theory shit online, people don't think this is possible.  

It's actually very easy.  

Someone just needs to put one of those vibrating beds from social care on procurement, slightly misinstall it, and you created an environmental stressor.  

You don't actually need to need the alarm, but in certain government environments, this will fly under HM treasury radar.  

So in theory in this country, if you were a fucking asshole, you could fuck with someone this way and not be noticed.  

Women and people marginalised on identity basis a highly likely to live in accommodation and lends itself to doing this next door, and it will drive anyone mad just with the impact of it. It will never be audible to a casual visitor. It will cause long-term harm to anyone living in the property.  

It's kind of like using anything we learned from sick building syndrome, and massively weaponising it.  

Anyway. I'm just reporting that the magically turned itself off once I did installed that but can give me evidence from the Landlord to do something.  

Anything else is obviously just my chatter, isn't it?  

and unless my communication is heavily gated, wow that was a coincidental time to get a message about a task huh?

sorry appreciate that. We've stopped the noise but the cat that previously had problems going to the bathroom pretty much everywhere that wasn't the litter tray, is now expressing all the attachment and feeling quite needy. I really don't want you guys to start doing this again.  

I don't know why we're going through the motions as if this is March or April, I don't know if you've recently been handled over to a different team. This didn't work last time and it caused a lot of distress and problems.  

It's also worth noting that this was a big factor towards escalating to cabinet.  

The reason it escalated that quickly is because of how highly distressing it was, and how it really could not wait but also how police representation ("neighbourhood police" who didn't know the neighbourhood ... those ones) would explain it away.  

I've only just managed to train her back into using the litter box consistently. She's an adult cat and she had a lot of pain following her hysterectomy and oopherectomy (the snip), and so this is really unhelpful.  

Puppy pads everywhere.  

Apart from the fact that it is already unpleasant for me (akin to motion sickness), it's highly distressing for one of my cats in particular. Please don't do it for her sake.  

if this is actually part of a standardised protocol, I really have to ask what we are doing to say godchildren in a dwelling when this happens, including children who are just in flats nearby who are not part of the operation at all. The only reason that I can tell what it is is because I've lived in a lot of old buildings. I'm used to having to differentiate what is going wrong with the pipework or the electrics or whatever, so I can tell that it's weird and that it's not standard.  

I have a lot of empathy for people who must go through this and think "why so ill?" or "why are my kids acting so weird all of a sudden?".  

Really speaks to not really thinking multidimensional about the impact of this; i've already talked about what looks like a lack of supervision, and so it's not too surprising that there's a lack of thinking about the environmental hazard to others.  

I appreciate the English law is incredibly complex and nitty-gritty, and I'm as annoyed by having to do forms as anyone else, but we also have to recognise this a reason that these laws are in place. There is real harm that can be caused by things like this. So quite frank I'm not really sure why we are still doing this. This is not legal in the UK. This is also not really achieving anything.  

I just want tonight as well that the way the social feeds have been recently already suggest that we're going back to that March/April period.  
again, I really don't get it.  

This is not secret and it's not covert.  

I don't know how you're justifying it, or what you're seeking to gain from it.  

If this is just evidence that interference is no longer working to cover what you want to cover, you just really expose yourself by putting yourself so close physically, and utilising technology in this manner.  

i'm just asking if you do a job, but it's harmful to me at least it was some degree of competence.  

and honestly, if this has any attachment to our infamous unit who is based university in Yorkshire?  

Stop embarrassing us.  

You know what I mean.  

People here think I'm okay; I don't want to be associated with this cluster fuck.
