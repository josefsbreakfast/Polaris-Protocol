low hum slow oscullation

having these guys in my life has lent to a lit of diy troubleshooting fr.  
The hum is not audible in air, but conduct through an iron  bed frame.  

What could the rotating cast of men on the middle floor, who have previously responded to switching things off when a particular police force emailed (I know right, literally seconds after, several times), possibly have brought into the house, that makes this noise and it could be brought into our house?  

these guys are so annoying.  

And I had wondered why my Internet was starting to trend toward locating me in Sheffield again.  

bloody yorkshiremen ffs.
