low hum slow oscullation

2021-10-25  

having these guys in my life has lent to a lit of diy troubleshooting fr.  
The hum is not audible in air, but conduct through an iron  bed frame.  

What could the rotating cast of men on the middle floor, who have previously responded to switching things off when a particular police force emailed (I know right, literally seconds after, several times), possibly have brought into the house, that makes this noise and it could be brought into our house?  

these guys are so annoying.  

And I had wondered why my Internet was starting to trend toward locating me in Sheffield again.  

bloody yorkshiremen ffs.

### completely predictable solution to the problem:  

- Download a reliable app to differentiate electromagnetic wave forms, because it doesnt match mechanucal means, because if it is a transformer in a nearby building/flat, definitely need to show your Landlord a thing is actually gappening so they actually have grounds to do anything.  
- You don't need to go any further just download the app.
- Obviously this is just how electrical physics works;

unfortunately, I do feel like I want to vomit. It's a bit like if you evolution sickness and you're off the theme park ride on the boat of the car or whatever. You know a reason to want to be sick, but your brain doesn't recovered yet. That's what it feels like.  

Let me see annoying vibration is gine, i guess.  

So it's really reassuring to see that we're just in actual FOMO territory again.  

How fantastic.  

And you know, I can't complain to anyone because the last time you made me look psychotic. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  

Who even needs legal recourse when you can just... definitely not torturous civilians? ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò  

The best bit is because there's so much conspiracy theory shit online, people don't think this is possible.  

It's actually very easy.  

Someone just needs to put one of those vibrating beds from social care on procurement, slightly misinstall it, and you created an environmental stressor.  

You don't actually need to need the alarm, but in certain government environments, this will fly under HM treasury radar.  

So in theory in this country, if you were a fucking asshole, you could fuck with someone this way and not be noticed.  

Women and people marginalised on identity basis a highly likely to live in accommodation and lends itself to doing this next door, and it will drive anyone mad just with the impact of it. It will never be audible to a casual visitor. It will cause long-term harm to anyone living in the property.  

It's kind of like using anything we learned from sick building syndrome, and massively weaponising it.  

Anyway. I'm just reporting that the magically turned itself off once I did installed that but can give me evidence from the Landlord to do something.  

Anything else is obviously just my chatter, isn't it?  

and unless my communication is heavily gated, wow that was a coincidental time to get a message about a task huh?
