# 🗂️ When Institutions Start Treating You as a Category, Not a Person  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*The moment bureaucratic drift becomes personally visible: when your individuality disappears inside someone else’s risk category, stereotype, or metadata tag.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
One of the earliest and most painful experiences of democratic or bureaucratic drift is the moment you are no longer treated as:

- a specific person  
- with a specific history  
- in a specific situation  

…but instead as:

- a category,  
- a metadata label,  
- a risk adjective,  
- a problem profile,  
- an identity stereotype,  
- or an “administrative type”.

This node explains the psychological and structural mechanisms behind this shift, why it happens, and why it is one of the clearest early indicators of institutional authoritarian drift.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Defines what it means to be “category-coded” by an institution.  
- Maps the transition from personhood → metadata → risk profile.  
- Explains why institutions switch from human to categorical processing under pressure.  
- Validates the emotional distress of being mis-seen or flattened.  
- Identifies category-coding as a key sign of democratic erosion.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 🗂️ 1. What Category-Coding Actually Is  
When a system is under pressure, humans become:

- types  
- patterns  
- risk objects  
- data points  
- workload units  
- potential liabilities  

Category-coding is the process of replacing **your actual self** with a **bureaucratic shorthand**.

This shorthand then becomes the basis of decision-making.

---

### 📉 2. Why Category-Coding Happens  
Institutions switch to categorical perception when they are:

- overworked  
- under-resourced  
- politically pressured  
- fearful  
- operating in crisis  
- following Prevent or safeguarding logic  
- overwhelmed by case flow  
- driven by culture war narratives  

In these contexts, categorisation is:

- faster  
- psychologically safer  
- organisationally rewarded  
- easier to justify  
- compatible with fear  

Human nuance becomes a “risk”.

---

### ⚡ 3. The Psychological Impact  
Being category-coded feels like:

- invisibility  
- humiliation  
- depersonalisation  
- dread  
- powerlessness  
- flattening  
- being misinterpreted on purpose  
- being treated as suspicious by default  
- being argued with by a “shadow version” of yourself  

It is an attack on the core experience of personhood.

Most people describe it as:

> “They were not even talking to *me* anymore.”

    C --> D["Assign Category<br>(risk / identity / behaviour)"]
    D --> E["Decisions Based on Category"]
    E --> F["Loss of Personhood"]
```

Once category-coded, it is extremely difficult to return to being seen as an individual.

---

### ⛓️ 5. Common Categories Institutions Use  
Institutions often default to simplistic categories:

- “non-compliant”  
- “emotionally unstable”  
- “potential risk”  
- “politically sensitive”  
- “Prevent-adjacent”  
- “complex case”  
- “hostile”  
- “overly emotional”  
- “attention-seeking”  
- “vulnerable adult”  
- “aggressive”  
- “high-demand service user”  
- “identity X = risk Y”  

None of these categories describe a real person.  
They describe **institutional fear**.

---

### 🧬 6. How This Links to Authoritarian Drift  
Authoritarian systems:

- love categories,  
- hate nuance,  
- fear individuality,  
- and rely on simplified models of people.

Democracies drift authoritarian long before they fully collapse,  
and category-coding is the frontline symptom.

It is the first moment the system says:

> “It is administratively easier if you are not too specific.”

That sentence has killed civil liberties across history.

---

### 🧩 7. Why Minorities and Dissidents Get Category-Coded First  
Because category-coding follows patterns of:

- racialisation  
- antisemitism  
- Islamophobia  
- anti-Black bias  
- xenophobia  
- ableism  
- misogyny  
- class prejudice  
- political othering  

Institutional gaze sees “risk profiles,” not people.

---

### 🔍 8. The Lived Experience: What It Feels Like  
People describe:

- sensing the “tone shift”  
- being spoken about as if they aren’t in the room  
- being told what they “must” mean  
- having their motives rewritten by systems  
- their words being filtered through suspicion  
- interactions feeling surreal or uncanny  
- the sense of “losing control of their own narrative”  
- being talked to in generic scripts  
- feeling like they are in a role they didn’t choose  

It is dehumanisation through admin.

---

### 🛠️ 9. How to Recognise it Early  
These are reliable early cues that you’re being category-coded:

- staff refer to you using adjectives before details  
- decisions are made about you, not with you  
- the system treats emotional expression as risk  
- questions become leading or circular  
- you get identical responses from different departments  
- nobody will write down clear reasoning  
- your individuality feels “lost in translation”  
- you sense “institutional fear” behind every choice  
- you stop being believed as the expert on your own life  

These are not coincidences.  
They are drift.

---

### 🧭 10. The Polaris Reframe  
Being category-coded is **not your fault**.  
It is a structural failure, not a personal one.

Your distress is valid because:

> **You are reacting to losing control of how the state sees you.  
> That is a core democratic harm.**

## 🏮 Footer  
**When Institutions Start Treating You as a Category, Not a Person** belongs to the Polaris Democratic Drift Phenomenology cluster.  
It identifies category-coding as one of the earliest and clearest signals of systemic instability and validates the emotional impact of losing personhood in bureaucratic environments.
