*How PREVENT’s anticipatory suspicion framework plants the structural foundations for authoritarian-style governance.*

## Orientation
This note explains how PREVENT’s foundational logic—anticipating ideological drift, monitoring behaviour, and escalating based on subjective impressions—functions as a structural seed for proto-authoritarian effects. It does not claim that PREVENT was created with authoritarian intentions. Instead, it documents how the system’s core design features naturally extend into behaviours associated with authoritarian states when layered onto failing services and risk-averse culture.

## Key Features
• PREVENT normalises early intervention based on subjective signals.
• “Spotting signs” encourages surveillance-like attentiveness.
• Behavioural interpretation becomes a form of social control.
• Low evidence thresholds enable disproportionate escalation.

## What makes PREVENT a proto-authoritarian seed
A system becomes proto-authoritarian when it exerts controlling, suppressive, or punitive effects without the explicit intent to do so. PREVENT introduces key elements of such systems:
• pre-crime logic
• anticipatory suspicion
• monitoring of affect and behaviour
• normalisation of reporting others
• low evidentiary thresholds
• escalation pathways that are difficult to reverse
These features replicate structural components of authoritarian governance even when embedded in a democratic setting.

## The role of anticipatory suspicion
PREVENT frames behaviours—anger, withdrawal, distress, political curiosity—as early warning signs. This converts ordinary emotion into searchable data. When people adjust their behaviour to avoid misinterpretation, the environment shifts from expressive to controlled, producing an authoritarian-like atmosphere.

## How subjective interpretation expands institutional power
Because PREVENT relies on human judgement, institutions gain broad discretion over what counts as risk. Subjectivity widens the net:
• distress becomes instability
• criticism becomes grievance
• ND traits become unpredictability
• fatigue becomes disengagement
When institutions can escalate based on feeling rather than evidence, power centralises.

## Why the seed grows in collapsing environments
A seed only becomes a plant under the right conditions. PREVENT’s proto-authoritarian features expand when:
• public services are under severe strain
• staff lack time to contextualise behaviour
• risk-aversion dominates decision-making
• templates replace judgement
• liability is feared
• training emphasises caution
In these environments, anticipatory frameworks shift from guidance to enforcement.

## Examples of proto-authoritarian drift emerging from PREVENT logic
• political expression becomes dangerous
• emotional expression becomes suspicious
• people self-silence to avoid escalation
• behaviour is moderated for institutional comfort
• reputational harm becomes a governance tool
• soft coercion replaces transparency
• dissent is conflated with instability or threat

## How PREVENT conditions a population
PREVENT indirectly teaches students, patients, staff, and community members to:
• avoid visible distress
• avoid conflict
• avoid political conversation
• maintain neutral affect
• comply with institutional expectations
This conditioning is not imposed through force but through fear of misinterpretation, creating a population that behaves in a more controlled, less expressive manner.

## Why the seed metaphor matters
Calling PREVENT “authoritarian” is inaccurate. The correct framing is that PREVENT contains the foundational logic from which authoritarian behaviours can grow under stress. The seed is structural:
• pre-emptive focus
• behaviour-level analysis
• suspicion embedded in everyday life
• escalation tied to subjective interpretation
The plant is what grows in failing systems.

It explains how PREVENT’s anticipatory framework can act as the foundation for authoritarian-style behaviours when combined with institutional fragility, subjective interpretation, and risk-averse culture.
