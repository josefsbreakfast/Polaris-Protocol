*How historical ideas about children as resources reappear inside modern data systems.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines how the long-standing treatment of children as **assets** did not disappear with legal reform, but instead **re-emerged in data systems**.

Where earlier systems extracted:
- labour,
- bodies,
- identity,
- or obedience,

modern systems extract:
- data,
- metadata,
- risk signals,
- and narrative leverage.

The medium changed.  
The logic often did not.

---

## 🧭 From child labour to child data

Historically, children were valuable because of what they could produce.

In data-driven systems, children are valuable because of what they can **generate**:
- records,
- behavioural traces,
- predictive signals,
- justificatory narratives.

Children become:
- early data points,
- long-lived profiles,
- future-risk containers.

This transforms vulnerability into **informational yield**.

---

## 🧿 Children as “clean” data subjects

Data systems often treat children as:
- lower-risk legally (wrong),
- less likely to challenge records,
- less able to contest inaccuracies,
- more likely to carry errors forward silently.

As a result:
- early misclassification hardens into fact,
- false narratives persist into adulthood,
- and correction becomes harder the longer the data lives.

Silence becomes a feature, not a bug.

---

## 🧠 Identity fragmentation and persistence

Children’s data is frequently:
- split across agencies,
- governed inconsistently,
- retained indefinitely,
- and repurposed without meaningful consent.

Unlike adults, children rarely control:
- how data is created,
- how it is interpreted,
- or how it follows them.

This makes childhood data uniquely powerful — and uniquely dangerous.

---

## 🧿 Risk scoring and narrative inheritance

In many systems, childhood data is used to:
- infer future behaviour,
- justify monitoring,
- shape institutional response,
- or rationalise constraint.

Once a child is framed as:
- risky,
- problematic,
- exceptional,
- or sensitive,

that framing tends to persist.

The data tells a story — and the person inherits it.

---

## 🛑 When data replaces safeguarding

Safeguarding should prioritise:
- care,
- correction,
- and protection.

But when children are treated as data assets:
- safeguarding becomes surveillance,
- care becomes compliance,
- and harm becomes “signal”.

This is not protection.  
It is **containment disguised as insight**.

---

## ⚖️ Why consent is structurally impossible here

Children cannot meaningfully consent to:
- long-term data retention,
- future interpretation,
- or cross-system reuse.

Yet systems routinely behave as though:
- early consent (or proxy consent) is permanent,
- silence equals agreement,
- and adulthood ratifies childhood capture.

This violates both the spirit and letter of children’s rights.

---

## 🧠 The lifecycle problem

Once collected, child data tends to:
- outlive its purpose,
- migrate across systems,
- and escape original context.

What began as:
- safeguarding,
- healthcare,
- or education data

can later function as:
- risk justification,
- credibility erosion,
- or institutional defence.

The child never opted into this trajectory.

---

## 🛠️ What ethical data practice would require

Ethical handling of children’s data requires:

- radical minimisation of collection  
- strict time limits on retention  
- active correction and deletion rights  
- recognition of adulthood as a reset point  
- refusal to treat vulnerability as informational value  

Without these, data systems quietly recreate the **child-as-asset** model.

---

## 🧠 Why this matters

When children are treated as data assets:
- harm scales silently,
- injustice becomes automated,
- and repair becomes administratively “impossible”.

Data remembers what systems refuse to correct.

Breaking this pattern is not a technical task.  
It is a moral one.

*The Child as Asset in Data* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how historical patterns of child exploitation reappear within modern data systems — and why this logic must be actively dismantled.
