# 🪼 We choose to allow online stalking of women and children  
**First created:** 2025-12-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*On the deliberate tolerance of digitally legible harm.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node documents a structural choice, not a technical failure: the routine tolerance of online stalking and harassment of women and children despite its clear detectability through existing metadata systems.

The behaviour is visible. The signals are legible. The inaction is deliberate.

## 🧿 Analysis  

Online stalking is not subtle. It produces repeatable, machine-readable signatures:  
timing convergence, proximity clustering, linguistic reuse, cross-platform shadowing, and persistence over time.

These same indicators are routinely used to detect spam, fraud, and political coordination.  
When the targets are women or children, those signals are reframed as “engagement,” “conflict,” or “drama.”

This is not a tooling gap.  
It is an incentive choice.

The downgrade of stalking into “normal internet behaviour” functions as a containment mechanism:  
- credibility erosion  
- forced individualisation (“just block”)  
- denial of systemic pattern recognition  

The result is predictable: harm continues, responsibility diffuses, and perpetrators gain structural cover.

## 🔥 What this node asserts  

- Online stalking is **already detectable at scale**  
- Platforms **already possess the analytic capacity** to identify it  
- Failure to act represents **governance choice**, not ignorance  
- The burden of proof is unfairly shifted onto survivors  
- Children are exposed through the same permissive logic

## 🏮 Footer  

*We choose to allow online stalking of women and children* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It records a systemic decision point where detectable harm is normalised rather than prevented.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
