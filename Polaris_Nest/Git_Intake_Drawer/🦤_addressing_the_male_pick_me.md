I am well aware what we're getting at in the content projected at a particular story, and how much we all want to talk about it.  

I am not really able to discuss it without saying things which count as libel; the untimely death of the main witness means no court has ever heard the case.  

And I am not stupid, so I only say it in what would be considered private communications, but I think we are all well aware of where I land on the matter.  

Nothing allows you to act poorly towards children. There's no qualifiers to that.  

As adults we ought to be prepared to meet just process to nip these behaviours as early as practicable, to prevent further harms.
