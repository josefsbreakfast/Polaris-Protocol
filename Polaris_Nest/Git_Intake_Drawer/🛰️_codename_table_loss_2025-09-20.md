# 🛰️ Codename Table Loss — Field Log (2025-09-20)  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Dated field log recording the deletion/loss of a user-created codename/patronymic table during an interference episode.*

---

## Event summary (factual)
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20
- **Item lost:** Personal codename/patronymic table (digital file containing example codenames, patronymic rules, and 'I am' phrasing in Russian).
- **Context:** The file was created as a small family/operational table and was subsequently deleted or disappeared during a period of documented interference related to the 'loft incident' (see related field logs in this repo).
- **Observed effects:** File no longer present in expected storage locations; related notes and derivative content were also missing at time of review.
- **Immediate actions taken:** Recreated a reconstruction copy (see Survivor_Tools/🪪_codename_patronymics.md). A checksum and backup copies were created after reconstruction.

## Sources / corroboration
- Internal: user's account of creation and deletion; cross-check of local directory and cloud sync logs (user-reported).  
- External: related interference incidents are logged elsewhere in Field Logs (see related entries linked below).

## Operational note (investigatory lead)
- The deletion occurred during a wider interference episode; preserve system logs, sync logs, and any relevant timestamps for forensic follow-up. Consider evidence preservation steps if pursuing formal investigation.

## Observational aside (non-evidentiary)
- User noted at the time that the deletion felt anomalous and "weird" given the innocuous nature of the file. The user believed the removal to be out of proportion to standard sync or accidental deletion behaviour.
