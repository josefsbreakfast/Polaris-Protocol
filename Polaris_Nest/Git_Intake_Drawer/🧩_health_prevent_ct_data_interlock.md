# 🧩 Health → Prevent → CT Data Interlock  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*Diagnostic mapping of institutional overlap between healthcare research data environments and counter-terrorism analytics frameworks in UK universities.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Universities running **clinical and psychological research** under NIHR or NHS umbrellas often also host **Home Office or defence-funded Prevent / CT programmes**.  
When these coexist within the same institutional data infrastructure — or share research staff, ethics boards, or IT governance — they can create unacknowledged bridges between **confidential health datasets** and **security-surveillance environments**.

The issue is not necessarily deliberate misuse.  
It is structural: an *adjacency problem* where compliance firewalls are weaker than institutional incentives for “data interoperability.”

## 🧠 Structural Pattern  

| Vector | Description | Risk Expression |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **1 – Infrastructure adjacency** | Shared repositories (e.g. White Rose Research Online) connect medical and CT faculties at Leeds, Sheffield, York. | Metadata from health trials may transit through systems with CT access permissions. |
| **2 – Research culture crossover** | Staff hold dual roles in health informatics & security analytics. | Prevent logic (risk scoring, behavioural flags) seeps into clinical-research framing. |
| **3 – Ethics board fatigue** | Same committees vet both health and CT proposals. | “Public safety” language erodes patient-participant confidentiality norms. |
| **4 – Funding consolidation** | NIHR / ESRC / Home Office co-funded “resilience” initiatives. | Financial incentives for data re-use outpace consent governance. |
| **5 – Semantic blending** | Terms like “vulnerability,” “behavioural activation,” “resilience” used in both domains. | Health interventions become proxies for behavioural-risk modelling. |

## 🧩 Case Anchors  
- **BEADS Trial** – NIHR HTA funded post-stroke depression study (UoN + Sheffield CTRU) → archived in *White Rose Research Online* (Sheffield node).  
- **VOICE-2 Study** – NIHR HS&DR funded dementia-care communication project → University of Nottingham lead.  
- **White Rose Universities** (Leeds | Sheffield | York) host overlapping research units in *policing, counter-terrorism, behavioural science,* and *health informatics.*

These adjacency lines mean that even if a clinical trial is cleanly run, its **data-governance perimeter** may overlap with Prevent-linked infrastructures.

## ⚖️ Governance & Duty-of-Care  
1. **Article 5(1)(f)** UK GDPR — Integrity & confidentiality: systems must isolate health data from security analytics.  
2. **Article 24** — Accountability: universities must evidence firewalls, not just claim them.  
3. **Equality Act 2010 s.149** — Public Sector Equality Duty: Prevent adjacency can constitute indirect discrimination where protected characteristics correlate with flagged “risk” variables.

### 🧨 Containment-Breach Risk — OSA-Flagged Data in Mixed Systems  
If data carrying an **Official Secrets Act (OSA) or security-classification flag** enters a mixed civilian infrastructure (e.g. NHS, NIHR, or university research servers), the flag functions as a **metadata artefact** rather than a legal boundary.  
Such systems interpret the tag as a query variable, not a clearance restriction, allowing replication and versioning to propagate it across datasets.  
Even without evidence of access, the coexistence of OSA-marked identifiers and open research data constitutes a **containment-breach condition** under **Article 5(1)(f)** UK GDPR (integrity & confidentiality) and under institutional security policy.  
This is a structural failure: the data becomes *theoretically available* to unauthorised contexts, appearing “up for grabs” through no single person’s intent.
