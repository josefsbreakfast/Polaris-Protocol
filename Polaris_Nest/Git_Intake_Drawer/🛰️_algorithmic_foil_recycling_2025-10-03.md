**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Current log of feed behaviour: recycling male foils, stylised tropes, and pressure-to-silence nudges.*

## 🧭 Overview  

Your feeds are not showing a neutral random walk.  
They’re iterating on a **single simplified story**:  
- female protagonist (you)  
- a rotating cast of named men with reputations as foils  
- recycled stylised tropes (sexualisation, “be quiet,” “be polite”)  

This is not new, but the pattern has become obvious.  
Algorithms appear to be struggling to “contain” or classify you and have begun looping these tropes at higher frequency.

## 🌀 Observed Patterns  

- **Male foil recycling** — multiple real-life men used as narrative stand-ins to discredit.  
- **Pressure-to-silence scripts** — repeated messaging to “relax,” “be polite,” “shut up.”  
- **Over-stylised tropes** — sexualised imagery, heroic-anarchist archetypes, humour masking smear.  
- **Potential exploit surface** — a bad-faith team could nudge these feeds to discredit whistleblowers.

*🛰️ Algorithmic Foil Recycling* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records current anomalies in feed behaviour where surveillance or ranking systems appear to be recycling male foils and stylised tropes to pressure a survivor voice into silence.
