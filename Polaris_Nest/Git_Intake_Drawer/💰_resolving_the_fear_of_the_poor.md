# 💰 Resolving the Fear of the Poor  
**First created:** 2025-10-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*On the reflexive anxiety of wealth toward visibility of need.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

From Victorian charity boards to modern policy think-tanks, the rich have designed institutions that **manage proximity** to poverty.  
The fear is not of crime, but of contagion — moral, aesthetic, emotional.  
To resolve it, we must name it as architecture: of distance, not defence.

## 🔍 Notes for Expansion  

- Historical roots: “deserving” vs “undeserving” poor.  
- Philanthropy as firewall.  
- Media archetypes (benefits scrounger, welfare queen, rough sleeper).  
- Economic dependence disguised as moral superiority.  
- Mutual visibility as cure: policy that assumes shared vulnerability.

*Resolving the Fear of the Poor* is a living stub of the Polaris Protocol.  
It examines class fear as a design principle and proposes visibility as antidote.
