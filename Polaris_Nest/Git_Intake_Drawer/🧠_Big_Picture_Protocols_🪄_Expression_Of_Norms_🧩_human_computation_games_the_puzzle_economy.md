# 🧩 Human Computation Games — The Puzzle Economy
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-11  
*How play became labour and verification became extraction.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
CAPTCHA was the first game most of us never agreed to play.  
When we clicked the blurry street signs, we weren’t just proving we were human — we were **training the machines that would later replace us**.  
This node traces how simple “puzzle” interfaces, from CAPTCHAs to addictive match-three games, convert micro-attention into monetisable machine learning.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Human computation** disguised as entertainment or security.  
- **Behavioural telemetry** harvested through friction loops.  
- **Consent laundering**: turning participation into presumed permission.

## 🧿 Analysis  
In the early 2000s, reCAPTCHA turned the labour of text transcription into book digitisation.  
By the 2010s, those puzzles became image-recognition tests for self-driving cars.  
Now, almost every “casual puzzle” system performs double duty — refining algorithmic prediction through aggregated human timing, error patterns, and perceptual heuristics.

CAPTCHA made *labour disappear inside leisure*.  
What was once paid annotation work became “prove you’re human.”  
The shift normalised invisible, unpaid participation in data-training loops.

When “play” feeds surveillance systems, enjoyment becomes a governance mechanism:  
each solved puzzle polishes the mirror that reflects you back as predictable.

*🧩 Human Computation Games — The Puzzle Economy* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the conversion of micro-attention into training data and the moral erasure of labour behind “fun.”
