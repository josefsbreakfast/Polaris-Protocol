# 🛰️ Proximity to Experiments Note — Counterfactual St George’s 2016  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Records the hypothesis that being at St George’s in 2016 would have increased exposure to early behavioural-insight interventions, and that displacement away reduced that proximity.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
The subject reflects that if they had attended St George’s (London) in 2016, they may have been in closer institutional and geographic proximity to early behavioural-insight pilots led or influenced by the Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team (BIT). Being nudged to Nottingham instead may have reduced the likelihood of directly observing anomalies in these interventions.

---

## 📍 Observed Dynamics  
- **BIT focus areas 2010–2016:** HMRC (tax compliance), DWP (benefits/job-seeking), NHS & DH (organ donation, obesity, smoking cessation), NICE & Cambridge collaborations.  
- **London proximity:** St George’s as a major medical school and NHS trust sat geographically and institutionally closer to BIT’s early health pilots and ministerial oversight.  
- **Counterfactual:** attendance at St George’s could have placed the subject in an environment where behavioural interventions were actively trialled or evaluated.  
- **Hypothesis:** displacement away (to Nottingham) may have functioned to limit exposure to these experiments — particularly for an individual likely to notice and log anomalies.

## 📝 Extension — Memory of “test-like” nudge  
- The subject notes that the nudge toward Nottingham, and away from St George’s, carried a striking **“behavioural psychology test 101” feel**.  
- This impression persists as a memory not because the event was dramatic or personally charged, but because of how **oddly constructed** the choice felt.  
- The decision point seems disproportionately memorable relative to its emotional weight; it **should not have stood out**, yet it does because the framing felt designed.  
- The test-like quality is logged here as an **anomaly of presentation** rather than as evidence of motive.

---

## 🔎 Why This Matters  
- **Observational sensitivity:** individuals inclined to record and analyse subtle anomalies could provide unplanned scrutiny of pilot interventions.  
- **Democratic implication:** if displacement occurs systematically, it may suppress early detection of policy risks (sludge, equity harms).  
- **Recordkeeping:** logging this as hypothesis ensures future analysts can cross-reference institutional pilot sites with personal displacement patterns.  
- **Extension note:** memory anomalies (events sticking out more than their inherent importance would suggest) can indicate test-like framing.

---

## ⚠️ Caution  
- This note records a **hypothesis**, not an evidentiary claim of motive or action by any specific party.  
- No direct evidence has been presented that St George’s hosted BIT pilots in 2016; the claim is about *proximity risk* not documented presence.  
- The “test-like” impression is recorded descriptively and neutrally.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Proximity to Experiments Note* is a Field Log node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It captures subject hypothesis on displacement away from London in 2016 as potentially reducing observational exposure to early behavioural insights pilots, and records the anomalous “test-like” feel of the nudge itself.
