# ⚖️ System Governance  
**First created:** 2025-10-31  
*Architectures of oversight, error, and self-correction inside automated bureaucracies.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The **System Governance** cluster examines how law, automation, and human habit intertwine.  
It tracks the small, nearly invisible choices—metadata fields, risk flags, polite silences—that shape the entire moral geometry of data governance.  
Each node studies a different hinge between accuracy and authority:  
how a typo becomes a classification, how belief becomes evidence, and how compliance becomes comedy.

> *Governance fails most quietly when it follows its own rules too well.*

## ⚖️ Intent  

To document the *governance layer as ecosystem*:  
- the code that governs the human,  
- the human who governs the code,  
- and the silence that passes for both compliance and care.  

Each node functions as a **diagnostic lens**—a way to see how oversight collapses under its own etiquette.

*⚖️ System Governance* is the skeleton of the Polaris Protocol’s accountability map.  
It anchors the **Metadata Integrity** and **Voice Fidelity** constellations, linking technical provenance to narrative ethics.  

> *Integrity is not a file format. It’s a habit of correction.*
