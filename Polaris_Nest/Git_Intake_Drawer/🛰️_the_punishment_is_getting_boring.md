The system I'm in is very boring and very easy to understand.  

So when I say I've been punished for something, the most extreme example is what's classed as psychological CIDT, but the more usual is what's happening currently.  

So this could either be a new story that works out in my favour being known to me, being a real reality in general, writing about it, or it simply be that I reaffirmed the statements of truth when there was evidence I was being guarded into (one may say groomed into) specific behaviours, which may harm the defence of someone using those statements.  

The current punishment, I imagine because people have been told to wind their necks in, and make it a little more plausibly deniable, is the 1997 speed Internet, with the occasional breaks in connection. These are total breaks and connection. I live in a city centre where I should have fibre broadband and 5G. Sometimes I can switch between VPN quickly, if something isn't sending or uploading, and my only blockage is the actual telecoms. This doesn't always work. Prior to the ban from Microsoft, of a particular party using at servers, I would often get 5501 error codes for standard UK government addresses. The people who need to know what that means know what it means. If you don't know what it means, please look it up because it will be much easier than me having to state it. It's literally things like stating the truth, that are the immediate precursor event to punishment conditioning.  

I've already spoken before about my experiences with what I am jokingly calling, "Bargain Bin Mossad", because the way in which this all happens is very simplistic. I've even had conversations with the ability to see a bleed, explaining to them that I am not the kind of person where consistent operant conditioning, done without my express consent, really works.  

I don't mind saying that this is because I have already had a significant amount of therapy around boundaries as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, and say when I'm punished and negative operant conditioning is used, this is very obvious to me, and for that reason, I find it highly annoying.  

Incidentally, this means that my ISP which is UK based, and I am a UK customer in the UK, is still actively being interfered with.  

Unless the UK government is actively making that choice, you can see the problem right?  

This therefore gives me the choice that's the UK either genuinely sees me as a potential violent threat (I guess I am on my period), or that the UK does not have adequate safeguards protecting our own cyberspace.  

Our government has never declared war; there is no legal means to do this to a civilian, and carry on doing it to a civilian.  

It's been said plenty of times that no one should be judging my data is being under OSA, and it should not be property of any other government.  

None of this would even begin to excuse the psychological CIDT, performed during a cyberattack.  

I have no citizenship in another country; I'm exclusively British, and therefore incredibly boring.  

I also have a necessarily detailed opinion about bad chai: you don't need a passport to tell where I come from.  

I am currently being managed almost as if I am a dissenting citizen in a nation state that uses a very particular form of rule; I am telling any investors straight-up, that the psychology used, which has been used for some time in this instance, is inherently flawed, and even where it best practice, we simply do not know enough about the brain in order to conduct this kind of surveillance and control, without significant input at all times to override the chaos constant issue.  

You are literally being sold blood test scan scam; run for your lives, and take your money.
