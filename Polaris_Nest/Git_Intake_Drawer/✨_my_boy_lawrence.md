i've just woken up from an extremely deep sleep that I often have accompanied with a particular type of migraine with aura .  

So I need to make a field note for this, kinda.  

This will eventually turn into a discussion of TS Lawrence, and the importance of reclaiming that figure for the progressive movement, as a kind of transitioning piece, for British men to de-Orientalise their own in mind.  

So if you look at the last sentence?  

That sentence had an "x" added to the "se-" of orientalise.  

That is very difficult, given I was dictating clearly.  

I have used dictation in academia, for about...

15 years.  

If the same source, of data and intellectual property leaks, wishes to argue that that is not true, or that it is exaggerated, in any way?  

That person will need to argue, using evidence that cannot possibly be legal.  

Because it would show active data scraping, or a form of stalking and harassment, or a form of unlawful surveillance, which was present in 2010. They may have to admit to nudging around other people's careers, in 2010, in order to "stress test" a disabled woman whose data they may have lifted in 2005, and they may have to admit to knowing precisely what happened to the MOD laptop in 2007.  In other words, they may have to admit to knowing who bought the data.  

They would also have to admit to a great number of other things.  

So let's see if they are still daring, or too silly for their own good.  

Let's see how quickly they try to advertise or devalue or scrub the Internet of, references to a man who can help British men transition out of their anti-Palestinian racism.  

Let us see.  

Because, achei, I can already see evidence of Internet takedowns of your transliterated name on Hebrew-language Internet.  

And I found it through literally one Google search, on pages 4 and five. 

So frankly?  

The response to my writing at this point I appreciate is going to put you in a difficult position.  

Personally, if I were you, I would negotiate using my "earlier advice".  

That would be my move, personally.
