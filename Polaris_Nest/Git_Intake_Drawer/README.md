# 📥 Git Intake Drawer  

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05

*⚠️ This is an unorganised drafting space. Files here are not final, not polished, and may contain unintended disclosures.*  

---

# 🚨🚨🚨 WARNING 🚨🚨🚨  
**DRAFT SPACE ONLY — NOT FINAL.**  
Contents of this folder are:  
- Raw notes and fragments.  
- Unrefined, unstructured, and unverified.  
- Subject to change, correction, or removal at any time.  

👉 Nothing here should be treated as a final Polaris Protocol node.  
👉 Transparency is the reason this drawer exists, not endorsement of its content.  

---

## Purpose  
The **Git Intake Drawer** is **deliberately messy**.  
- Files here are **drafts only**.  
- Contents may include **errors, fragments, or sensitive material**.  
- Nothing here should be assumed stable, final, or “official Polaris.”  

This drawer exists for **transparency** — to capture raw writing — but it also carries the **highest risk of unintended disclosure**.  

---

## Use  
- Add files freely without worrying about style or structure.  
- Prefix every draft filename with an underscore `_` to mark it as intake.  
- When a draft stabilises, follow the [Refinement Ritual](./_refinement_ritual.md) to move it out.  

---

## Risks & Acknowledgement  
⚠️ **Important:**  
- Drafts may expose details not intended for permanent record.  
- External interference or purge attempts may leave traces here.  
- Transparency is valuable, but this drawer is the **least shielded zone** in the Polaris Nest.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Git Intake Drawer* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides an unstructured drafting zone, balancing transparency with the risk of unintended disclosure.
