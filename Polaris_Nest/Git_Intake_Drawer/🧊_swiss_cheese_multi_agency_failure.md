# 🧊 Swiss Cheese Multi-Agency Failure  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*Applying the Swiss Cheese Model to safeguarding and multi-agency architectures.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Multi-agency safeguarding is supposed to strengthen protection. Instead, mismatched assumptions, excessive optimism about personnel, and pooled trauma data produce the exact conditions the Swiss Cheese Model warns about: **aligned holes**, compounded failure, and preventable harm.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Swiss Cheese Model applied to safeguarding.  
- How “assumption of goodness” creates structural holes.  
- Why multi-agency pooling increases alignment risk.  
- Governance redesign: layer, isolate, log, verify.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### **1. The First Hole: Assumption of Universal Goodness**  
When staff are treated as inherently safe because of the sector they work in, governance collapses.  
Goodness is not a metric.  
**Behaviour is.**

### **2. The Second Hole: Over-Pooling Data**  
Trauma markers, risk flags, welfare notes, Prevent triggers — once centralised, they produce a **hyper-visible vulnerability map**.

### **3. The Third Hole: Cross-Agency Amplification**  
Anonymous IDs collide.  
Assumptions travel across departments.  
One error becomes **consensus**.

### **4. The Alignment Event: Systemic Misread**  
When all holes line up:  
- naïve cultural beliefs  
- pooled trauma metadata  
- under-supervised access  
- inter-agency pattern reinterpretation  

…the system misclassifies the individual and locks the misread in place.
