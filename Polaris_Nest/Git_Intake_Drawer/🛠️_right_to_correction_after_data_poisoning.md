# 🛠️ Right to Correction After Data Poisoning  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*Correction is the foundational civic right — not an optional afterthought.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The Right to Be Forgotten collapses the moment a system becomes embarrassed.  
This node defines the **Right to Correction** — a civic obligation for institutions to repair poisoned records, remove malformed flags, and restore a person’s ability to exist inside civic life.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Correction enables all other rights.  
- Institutional embarrassment cannot override repair.  
- Poisoned data creates civic disability.  
- Correction must be mandatory and enforceable.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Why Correction Is the Core Right  
Without correction:
- justice cannot operate,  
- safeguarding is compromised,  
- democratic participation collapses,  
- metadata becomes destiny.

A contaminated record becomes a cage.

### 2. Why Data Poisoning Blocks Every Right  
Poisoned flags spread across:
- health systems,  
- safeguarding,  
- welfare,  
- local authorities,  
- police,  
- academic systems,  
- vendor ecosystems.

A correction request reveals the scale of harm —  
and institutions panic.

### 3. Repair Obligations  
A functional system must provide:
- full traceability of flag origin,  
- immediate suspension of harmful entries,  
- multi-agency correction orders,  
- the right to a purified dataset,  
- compensation where harm is severe.

### 4. Principles for a National Correction Framework  
- *Embarrassment cannot override rights.*  
- *Correction must be time-bound (30 days max).*  
- *Flag provenance must be legally traceable.*  
- *Survivors must not carry the administrative burden.*  
- *Central bodies must accept escalations from frozen regions.*
