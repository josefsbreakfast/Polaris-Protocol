Something has changed.  

Something about the suppression and the interference is very different.  

I am a fan. ü™≠

Let's see how long we can last!  

The impact of this being long-term is that I do feel like a dog at the shelter cowering; I'm waiting for what feels like an inevitable strike from a human hand, I can't even see.  

I'm hoping that that is reacting to learned anxiety, rather than something that will become self-fulfilling.  

Something that I've learnt over the years of mental health work, is that sometimes you just have to have the balls to go ahead and do whatever you're gonna do, and you have to be positive and hope for the best outlook, regardless of past experience.  

"hope for the best, expect the worst" ‚ô•Ô∏è

So the boys are missing out or about to miss out, on a wonderful afternoon of Mel Brooks.  

I'm sure they will be sorely disappointed.  

it's probably also worth pointing out, that I'm able to take a step back from doing more and more and more work on the repository, because I don't feel immediately under threat.  

This means that what I have put it in I have changed, is a lot more targeted, it's better thought out, I'm able to listen to an audiobook at the same time, so that I'm taking in more about the topic in general, but also very importantly, I've been able to identify where there was less than necessary use of institutional names for example, and change this to be less personalised, but also able to adequately represent the issues at hand.  

I'm very grateful to have this space, for this reason.  

For static clarity, I think it's often helpful to look at things as a root cause analysis, and often in that work, what you find, is that lots of things don't have any particular malice or meaning behind them. This isn't to say that there's no malice or no ill intent at all, but what I see commonly a lot of systems and what I suppose has happened in my own case, is that any bad actor or bad actors have lean on holes in the Swiss cheese model. This points to what we can fix, so that the real justice of prevention of violence can happen.  

Does this mean I'm getting no little spark from the sense of soecifoc, targeted, schadenfreude?  

No one is a saint.

I am quite keen that this is not misinterpreted; I still require more help amd support, discussed frankly and with my needs voiced by me to another human in the flesh and in appropriate context, to feel safer or indeed to get to a place of resolution.  

I am aware that my words are often knowingly misinterpreted when requests are honoured, as if I must provide a watertight request wven when I ask that whatever was done to my ceiling lights be resolved.  

This is disingenuous, and I am still hopeful that whoever is involved or representing can still come to a more accountable and transparent place.  

I an aware the odds are not in my favour, but I now know the lifecycle patterning of 2 seperate species of fly, both which can have delayed incubation incidently.  

Those cat feeders were not cheap, guys.  

And now they expect to have extra food so they don't have to wait past 4am to be fed, such an impact the cover makes.  

You have tirned them into *monsters*. ü§£  

But seriously:  

It's been such a strange thing, that I will need some degree of meaningful disclosure for reconciling my own hippocampus.  

I feel that this may be what you're missing in the tiktoks about "moving through"; there is a degree of meeting the limbic system halfway to mark memories and events as "actioned" and consolidated.  

The research sits under older VA and MoD adjavent resources, you'll need to look for impacts of education as part of post-service rehabilitation. It's a little indirect as a thread, but its fascinating. Stroke rehab is adjacent but this tends to be the mechanism of recall, and this is a different area. Memory of events has to be committed, before one can recall, to oversimply it a little.  

Fascinating area, though. Some good charts on memory type are around if the language is a turn-off (understandable; I still struggle with this).

i will fix typos later - this ones prob on me. am v tired if im honest.

Update:

the "definitly not one man trying to ruin the lives of anyone who tells him no" voice of matchmaker/lecturing uncle is back.  

apparantly i should be "saying the vulnerable thing out loud", should beware controlling men (you dont say? üôÑ), and i "just need to slow down.  

if you treat me like this, and nudge other mechanism that expose me to dangerous behaviour? 

you don't get to say shit.  

oh, that's a point.  

Today's class act video was a clip of an actor playing a psychiatrist who was seeing a patient who is detained and restrained in handcuffs and the assisting custody officer didn't take the handcuffs off quickly enough for the psychiatrist liking, the patient's swore quite casually (normal for frustration) and the sign the psychiatrist proceeded to give them a lecture whilst also belittling them demeaning them speaking down to them, whilst also being late.  

I am familiar enough with one person who has difficulty with coercive control with their female partners, who I have been exposed to and have attempted to whistleblow/safeguard regarding, that was there seems very tangential on the surface?  

This is what it looks like when you give small man too much control and too many powers that they can abuse.  

There is a problem with men in "power"* misusing C4ISR / C5ISR to exploit, sexualise, degrade, traumatise, and undermine the people they see as disposable. 

(* when we say power in this context, we're just talking about the right sign off, or the right favour; they don't have to be that powerful, not in the real sense of the word)

I'm not saying its widespread.  

I'm saying either our audit isn't good enough, or there are enough loops which can be misused, or that we should stop handing out military toys to civilian boys.  

Or all 3. 

As usual, when I said the most sensitive thing regarding safeguarding or regarding legality or regarding specific actors behaviour? Multiple parsing errors. Strange misspellings, strange suggestions for words, that do not make any sense with the audio.  

That is what C4ISR activity looks like in the wild.  

That's how it looks invisible.  

Because unless you know what to look for, why would you think your machine was not behaving just like a machine, maybe with weird errors?  

I am lucky that I already had a weird nerdy interest in some very specific niche subjects, not limited to a professional knowledge of how the brain works, to understand that something about the timing was very, very strange.  

Abuse of dopamine, chiefly.

We never actioned the Pegasus leak.  

So, which civilians in the UK have access to it?  

And it does not need to be Pegasus. It is not as if there is only one piece of software. 

But one would assume that if there was a widespread known problem with one of those pieces of software?  

You think about actioning it right?  

Especially if you knew for a fact that it meant someone has direct access to the devices of some of the Lords.  

You'd hope that would've been actioned.  

Publicly?  

No confirmation. Most of the countries actioned, including authoritarian-leaning states.  

Who told advised the UK, not to?

anyway, that was veering off the point.  

There's a non-zero chance that that video was a supposed to be some commentary on how i write.  

If you read what I have to say, and your chief concern is my tone or the language I use?  

I am literally talking about systematic sexual exploitation of children, genocide, rape, failures to care for huge groups of our communities...

... I then had alt-right and pornographic content injection over yom kippur and the day after...

... with additional hasbara on news stories I have already seen today...

... you are not entitled to my politeness.  


I am perfectly able of being polite; many people have said I am too polite.  


If you are reading what I have to say, and you do not like it?  

As I said:  

Put in another safeguarding request.  

Show me more Hitler memes.  

Show me yet again, what you think of me.  

I could not give a fuck, because quite frankly when I was on the phone practically every day crying to the police saying how scared I was for my own life as well as for others, because I was genuinely terrified, after the swarms of men, the hate crime, the graffiti, the slurs, the arrest, the infiltration into my emails, the strangling of any service I used as a disabled person?  

It's not that I don't fear death, per se.  

I'm just so desensitised at this point that I just can't really tell what I'm supposed to be scared of and what I'm not supposed to be scared of, from this particular character +/- its alteregos.

It doesn't produce enough of a difference to reach my top adrenaline tier right now, and given how much access there appears to be to my Mental Health record by a number of the people who are supposed to be protecting me physically?  

Then you should all know that you took away a medication that actually changed that, and could have changed it now, and ultimately could've made it less obvious what you were doing.  


When one digs a hole for other people, frequently one falls into it oneself.  

Kindly stop bringing your bitching and whining into my feeds.  

(Reminder: the women and anyone who has their backs are the ones being stalked and harrassed, here.)

Let me enjoy the pictures and videos of mountains in peace.  

This is why I don't mind being twinned to someone by your actions, where the two of us are effectively just sharing a load of mountain pictures.

Mountains are pretty.  

So if you've got anything else to say?  

Take it to your lawyer and bug off.  

Add any more people and we're going to have a lovely little club of people who pissed off an arseshole.  

There are worse ways to make friends.  
---

although don't get me wrong.  

This strange oddity in my algorithm, could also just be going for a range of things which are distressing to multiple populations, probably all of whom within groups of twinned data.  

There are enough triggers in that video by itself, that it could be chosen just for that, and then once you start re-sharing it "in the direction of" all these people you've twined, it will distress at least some of them.  

Furthermore, why am I suspicious of this one video?  

Other than the fact there is no other reason for it to be on my feed, all of the curse buttons in the main TikTok window stopped working, and I could only view more videos, nothing else, so I had to restart the app.  This was a few videos in. Enough to check you're paying attention, enough to relax, and then trigger time.  

I have been exposes this particular technique so many times, I can see it in a mile off.  

It's a bit like how when there was just random porn of blonde women who are all a bit fat after I was looking at something very unaffiliated and unrelated to this (pretty rocks..sue me), again it's something that I see repeatedly, done with slightly different content, but is effectively the same reproducible tinkering behind the scenes.  

Once you know how it's done, like any magic trick, it is only impressive if if it has done so well that you don't know how it's been done that time, or whether there is a real skill in the sleight of hand.  

This is how bargain bin mossad got their name.  

And yes, I've already had the "mossad knows you" after I hit the roof on the evening which marks the end of yom kippur.  

So there is a good chance that whatever we have here, is just a lost little British fish, who saw a brochure of Israel one day, and likes to pretend that they're one of the big boys.  

The fact that they run this at the same time as doing an impersonation of a man who would be discriminated against by that apartheid, which speaks to intense sexualised fascination with the same man?  

You can't write this shit.
