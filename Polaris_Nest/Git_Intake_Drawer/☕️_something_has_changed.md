Something has changed.  

Something about the suppression and the interference is very different.  

I am a fan. ü™≠

Let's see how long we can last!  

The impact of this being long-term is that I do feel like a dog at the shelter cowering; I'm waiting for what feels like an inevitable strike from a human hand, I can't even see.  

I'm hoping that that is reacting to learned anxiety, rather than something that will become self-fulfilling.  

Something that I've learnt over the years of mental health work, is that sometimes you just have to have the balls to go ahead and do whatever you're gonna do, and you have to be positive and hope for the best outlook, regardless of past experience.  

"hope for the best, expect the worst" ‚ô•Ô∏è

So the boys are missing out or about to miss out, on a wonderful afternoon of Mel Brooks.  

I'm sure they will be sorely disappointed.  

it's probably also worth pointing out, that I'm able to take a step back from doing more and more and more work on the repository, because I don't feel immediately under threat.  

This means that what I have put it in I have changed, is a lot more targeted, it's better thought out, I'm able to listen to an audiobook at the same time, so that I'm taking in more about the topic in general, but also very importantly, I've been able to identify where there was less than necessary use of institutional names for example, and change this to be less personalised, but also able to adequately represent the issues at hand.  

I'm very grateful to have this space, for this reason.  

For static clarity, I think it's often helpful to look at things as a root cause analysis, and often in that work, what you find, is that lots of things don't have any particular malice or meaning behind them. This isn't to say that there's no malice or no ill intent at all, but what I see commonly a lot of systems and what I suppose has happened in my own case, is that any bad actor or bad actors have lean on holes in the Swiss cheese model. This points to what we can fix, so that the real justice of prevention of violence can happen.  

Does this mean I'm getting no little spark from the sense of soecifoc, targeted, schadenfreude?  

No one is a saint.
