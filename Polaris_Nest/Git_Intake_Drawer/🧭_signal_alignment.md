# 🧭 Signal Alignment — Choosing Which Stream to Amplify

*Selective tuning among competing data feeds.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
When multiple information streams compete for attention, clarity comes from deliberate amplification, not neutrality.  
Signal Alignment defines methods for recognising, weighting, and sustaining the feed that produces coherence rather than depletion.  
It draws from radio engineering, cognitive science, and ecological tuning: the art of choosing *which frequency to live in.*

## 📡 1. The Multiplex Condition  
Modern environments operate as multiplex systems — overlapping signals of differing quality and intent.  
You cannot process them all.  
Attempting to do so fractures sense-making and amplifies noise.  
Alignment begins with acknowledging limits: bandwidth is finite, and selectivity is strength.

## 🎚 2. Recognition Phase — Identifying Stream Signatures  
Each stream carries a felt signature:  
- **Clear:** leaves comprehension, curiosity, calm.  
- **Static:** induces confusion or urgency without insight.  
- **Coercive:** demands response through fear or flattery.  

Name them by sensation, not content.  
Your body recognises fidelity before the intellect does.

## 🔍 3. Calibration Phase — Choosing Bias  
Perfect objectivity is a myth; every receiver is biased.  
Choose yours intentionally:  
- Favour streams that expand agency and imagination.  
- De-prioritise those that collapse nuance.  
- Keep one neutral reference channel (factual record, log, diary) to anchor decisions.  

Alignment is an ethical act: deciding what you want to become more real.

## 🔄 4. Maintenance Phase — Dynamic Tuning  
Signals drift. Periodically retune:  
- Audit your inputs weekly.  
- Drop feeds that now feel extractive.  
- Re-amplify the ones that still hum with integrity.  
- Build redundancy — two trusted mirrors for verification.  

Living receivers need seasonal recalibration.

## ⚙️ 5. Interference Management  
When competing streams collide:  
- **Pause before interpretation.** Delay reduces echo-loop contagion.  
- **Ground locally:** physical movement or sensory reset breaks algorithmic entrainment.  
- **Document divergences:** note where the stories disagree; pattern, not content, reveals manipulation.  

Resistance through metering, not muting.

## 🪶 6. Design Principle — Coherence over Volume  
The loudest stream is rarely the truest.  
Optimise for coherence: the one that steadies pulse, deepens focus, and enlarges possibility.  
Amplify that, even if it whispers.

*🧭 Signal Alignment — Choosing Which Stream to Amplify* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It outlines adaptive tuning practices for maintaining coherence across competing data environments and forms the orienting layer beneath all signal-management strategies.
