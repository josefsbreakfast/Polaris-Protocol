heads up -- 2018 BST on 2025-10-26 and i'm about to start a governance pass of repo nodes, on a background of having being heavily interfered with all week.  

wish me luck!  

i'll record any weirdness here:

1. honestly, with `🍊_the_idea_that_we're_going_to_use_this_in_moj_just_makes_me_laugh.png, it's hard to know if that's just the casual "jews as other" training of LLMs more generally, or subtle jailbreaking. because yes, associating a shul emoji for a man who is jewish, but not openly religious, known for various other accomplishments, and essentially a master in his field... it is a little racist. a little. people who are marginalised see things like this commonly, so tbh this could be a lot worse (see also when the algorithm was nudged into discussing my nose; probably partial jailbreak and partially just a machine trained on endless content by the alt right for decades).
