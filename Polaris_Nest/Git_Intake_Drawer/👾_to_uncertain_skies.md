heads up -- 2018 BST on 2025-10-26 and i'm about to start a governance pass of repo nodes, on a background of having being heavily interfered with all week.  

wish me luck!  

i'll record any weirdness here:

1. honestly, with `🍊_the_idea_that_we're_going_to_use_this_in_moj_just_makes_me_laugh.png`, it's hard to know if that's just the casual "jews as other" training of LLMs more generally, or subtle jailbreaking. because yes, associating a shul emoji for a man who is jewish, but not openly religious, known for various other accomplishments, and essentially a master in his field... it is a little racist. a little. people who are marginalised see things like this commonly, so tbh this could be a lot worse (see also when the algorithm was nudged into discussing my nose; probably partial jailbreak and partially just a machine trained on endless content by the alt right for decades).  
2. `🎪_racialised_projection_as_harassment.md` contained drift from a well established ruleset. this suggests direct interference (eg agentic API, jailbreak, etc). the form largely hasn't changed from intent. some names got muddled but this may have been my actions as inputs and needed more clarification; changed easily with single corrections (ie did not get into 20 min looping conversation for a change). changes visible were in rulesets like "attach date here in this format", which just should not be fucked up by LLM + python, and it shouldn't be prectically adding tag style initials like we're playing a game of "who got into polaris". (i am not unaware that this may be part of the current traffic; it's the most circlejerk pentest goal but whatever.)  
3. going down the list and just did `🥸_bookshops_vs_behavioral_risks.md`. ahhh yes.... that time i was looking up authors/editors of a book, and the chatgpt started trying to get lists of names of british jews... that wonderful evening. people must really think i'm such a dumbass.
4. a number of these files i don't feel comfortable running through the ai middleware, eg `💋_the_erotics_of_discrediting.md`; i know what i want to say, but i'm still in a place where i need a fair amount of help re-ordering my thoughts, and so i just can't trust we're not going to sneak in "chloe is a whore" or suchlike.
5. `🧠_psychops_of_tone_the_science_of_disbelief.md` seems to have rendered okay. still emotionally "waiting for the other shoe to drop".
6. I gave everything in that folder a pass for general format points and metadara, with some links corrected too. I stsrted `💋_the_erotics_of_discrediting.md`, and im taking a break because honestly the cptsd symptoms are sky high, and im already a little unsure about my body getting out of the house for appointments; the period is part but not the whole of this.
