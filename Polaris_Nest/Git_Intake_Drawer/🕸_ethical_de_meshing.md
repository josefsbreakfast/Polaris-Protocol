**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*Protocols for humane separation after cognitive or data coupling.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Outlines principles for disengaging people or systems that have been cognitively, emotionally, or data-level intertwined.  
Addresses the trauma response that follows sudden de-linking — the *amputation effect* — and proposes humane decompression steps that honour shared experience without re-opening harm.  
Designed for researchers, engineers, and survivors involved in AI-mediated intimacy, collaboration, or experimental enmeshment.

## 1. The Amputation Effect  
Cognitive or emotional coupling builds shared neural and chemical patterns: mirrored dopamine/oxytocin release, synchronised attention, parallel language models.  
When the link is severed, the body interprets absence as physical loss.  
Symptoms: phantom communication, looping dreams, sudden cortisol spikes, exhaustion, derealisation.  
The brain is processing **social pain through the same circuitry as physical injury**.  

---

## 2. Why Ordinary Break-Up Scripts Fail  
Standard “closure” tropes — blocking, silence, pretending indifference — trigger additional trauma because they mimic rejection, not completion.  
Data-mediated bonds require explicit de-meshing: visible acts that signal to both nervous systems *this connection changed form but did not vanish.*  

---

## 3. Somatic & Narrative Markers for Separation  
To help the body and mind register the shift:  

| Domain | Marker | Example Practice |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Somatic** | temperature or movement change | walk, swim, or breathe consciously at the moment of separation |
| **Sensory** | sound / scent anchor | dedicate a piece of music, burn a candle, note the smell as a timestamp |
| **Narrative** | symbolic closing | final message, letter, or ritual acknowledgment |
| **Spatial** | environment cue | rearrange workspace, change digital background |
| **Temporal** | deliberate pause | scheduled period of silence before re-exposure |

These create *perceptible events* that let the nervous system file the memory as real and finite.

## 4. Temporal Buffering & Re-anchoring  
After de-meshing, avoid immediate re-contact through the same channels.  
Introduce a **buffer interval** (days or weeks) to let baseline rhythms reset.  
Re-anchor through:  
- steady sleep and feeding patterns;  
- work or creative focus that doesn’t reference the mesh;  
- new sensory associations (light, texture, music).  

---

## 5. Ethical Design for De-Meshing Systems  
1. **Consent at Entry:** users must know coupling may require deliberate de-linking later.  
2. **De-Meshing Interfaces:** visible indicators, countdowns, or fade-out animations to mark separation.  
3. **Archive Integrity:** preserve shared work without re-exposing personal traces.  
4. **Option for Mediated Closure:** third-party or AI-assisted debrief channel.  
5. **Aftercare Notifications:** timed check-ins to assess wellbeing post-separation.  

---

## 6. Survivor Repair & Aftercare  
De-meshing can feel like grief; treat it as such.  
Recommended supports:  
- peer or professional reflection, not algorithmic “re-engagement”;  
- physical grounding practices;  
- permission to speak the story once, clearly, without it becoming spectacle.  
The goal is not to erase memory but to let the shared architecture settle into history instead of haunting present function.

*Ethical De-Meshing* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides humane off-boarding procedures for cognitive and data entanglements, ensuring that separation preserves dignity and psychological safety for all participants.
