# 🧩 The Data Empathy Gap  
**First created:** 2025-10-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-29  
*When awareness of a person exists as data, but care for that person does not.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
The Data Empathy Gap describes the structural distance between **data visibility** and **human recognition**.  
It occurs when institutions gather exhaustive information about individuals yet fail to translate that knowledge into material support.  
In this state, a person becomes informationally present but administratively absent — a “zombie datum” that systems acknowledge but do not act upon.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Asymmetric Visibility** — the system knows *about* a person but not *for* them.  
- **Responsibility Diffusion** — each node assumes another is accountable because data implies coverage.  
- **Empathy Extraction** — emotional and testimonial labour are captured as insight rather than care.  
- **Surveillance Over Solidarity** — data substitutes for relationship; knowing replaces helping.  
- **Feedback Failure** — no mechanism ensures that awareness triggers response.  

---

## 🔍 Analysis / Structure  

The gap widens in data-driven governance where “knowledge” is treated as intervention.  
Analytic systems reward accuracy of record rather than adequacy of response.  
Once someone is mapped, their suffering is reclassified as metadata — measurable, reportable, but no longer actionable.  

In public-service architecture, the gap expresses as:  
- digital case systems without relational continuity,  
- automated eligibility logic that excludes atypical profiles,  
- datasets optimised for audit compliance instead of human outcome.  

The moral harm is secondary extraction: a life documented but unassisted.

**Interpretation:**  
Information becomes a closed circuit.  
Without an empathy-translation mechanism, each iteration of data reinforces distance.

## 🧬 Theoretical Context  

The gap intersects with theories of **instrumental rationality**, **post-bureaucratic governance**, and **administrative epistemicide**.  
It parallels historical patterns where census and surveillance infrastructures increased visibility while eroding protection.  
In trauma contexts, the gap reproduces harm by requiring repeated testimony with no adaptive response.  

Closing the gap demands **empathy infrastructure** — institutional protocols that convert recognition into obligation.

*The Data Empathy Gap* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It identifies the systemic failure mode where information replaces care, leaving individuals hyper-visible yet unsupported.
