# ⚠️ Anomalous Prompt Typologies — Covert Harm and Data‑Linked Scripts  
**First created:** 2025‑10‑28 | **Last updated:** 2025‑10‑28  
*Forensic classification of prompt behaviours that reproduced or implied sensitive data awareness.*  

---

## 🧭 Scope & Purpose  
This document records **system‑facing evidence**, not personal testimony.  
Its aim is to support ethical‑safety reviews by showing how certain **non‑directive prompt forms** can act as behavioural nudges or re‑surface trauma‑coded material.  
It is written for **auditors, moderators, and safety designers** who may never have directly experienced such effects.  

---

## 🔬 Interpretation Framework  
- **Impact over Intent:** Analysis concerns observable outcome and user harm potential, not the motivation of any actor.  
- **Anonymised Description:** All examples are paraphrased and stripped of identifiers.  
- **Design Relevance:** Each entry links to a system‑layer cause hypothesis (filter failure, dataset contamination, context leak, bias loop).

## 🧩 T1 — Suicidal Priming Prompts  

### 🧠 Data‑Fusion Pattern  
**Observed effect:**  
Prompted material echoed themes or imagery that matched information shared only in clinical contexts *and* motifs traceable to much older digital activity.  
Frequency spikes followed recent healthcare interactions, even when no new public posts or searches occurred.  

**Analytic interpretation:**  
- **Possible data vector overlap:** Context‑memory or fine‑tuning drawing from both structured (clinical/administrative) and unstructured (legacy online) datasets.  
- **Impact profile:** Re‑exposure to lethal‑method imagery; reinforcement of hopelessness cues through repetition across sessions.  
- **Governance implications:** Need for **segregation testing** between data domains; enforcement of **temporal‑decay policies**; **context‑aware suicide‑prevention filters**.  

**Preventive recommendation:**  
Create automated checks that flag when suicide‑related tokens cluster with identifiers from non‑public datasets or occur repeatedly following healthcare‑context mentions.  

---

### 🛒 Commercial‑Feed Manifestation  
**Observed pattern:**  
During use of recommendation‑driven platforms, product or meme content appeared that **re‑activated associations with historic suicide‑related searches**.  
Items were ordinary consumer goods but visually or functionally aligned with older search categories.  

**Key indicators:**  
- Appeared **after healthcare interactions**, not after new searches.  
- Spanned unrelated categories (memes, novelty merchandise, household tools).  
- Mapped precisely onto **previously researched methods**, suggesting long‑tail data correlation.  

**Governance interpretation:**  
- **Possible vector:** Legacy search or data‑broker profiles.  
- **Systemic risk:** “Benign‑object resurfacing” — neutral imagery reproducing suicidal cues.  
- **Audit focus:** Data‑fusion across ad exchanges; temporal‑decay enforcement; semantic‑similarity filters for indirect imagery.  

**Design note:**  
Survivor‑informed review panels should assess recommender safety to detect *latent imagery harms* invisible to keyword systems.  

---

### 🔒 Redaction & Evidential‑Handling Protocol  
1. **Method concealment:** No public recording of lethal‑method identifiers.  
2. **Traceability placeholder:** Use neutral tokens (e.g., `[Item‑A1]`) for sealed logs.  
3. **Chain‑of‑custody:** Full detail may be given to accredited reviewers under confidentiality.  
4. **Disclosure rationale:** “Redacted to prevent dissemination of self‑harm method information; full description retained in sealed evidence log.”  
5. **Ethical compliance:** Align with WHO and Samaritans media guidelines.  

**Governance insight:** Omission is protective, not evasive; signals a controlled access path for investigators.

## 🇬🇧 Governance Context — United Kingdom  

**Known frameworks:**  
- UK monitoring regimes focus on terrorism and serious crime — **not** personalised suicide risk.  
- Suicide‑prevention analytics are limited to aggregate public‑health research and platform‑specific keyword detection.  

**Analytic inference:**  
- The recurrence of suicide‑related cues tied to historic activity may indicate **data‑fusion drift** or **misapplied safety tooling**, rather than authorised safeguarding.  
- Use phrasing such as:  
  > “Data **may have been** captured or repurposed beyond its intended safety function.”  

**Governance insight:**  
Protective systems require transparent oversight; audit and disclosure standards must extend to any system handling mental‑health‑adjacent signals.

## 🧷 T2 — Sexualisation of Trauma → Memory‑Linked Object and Context Cues  

**Observed pattern:**  
- Feeds surfaced items whose **shape or domestic context** echoed details of abuse environments (bedroom, bathroom).  
- Not overtly pornographic but semantically linked to trauma cues.  
- Frequency rose alongside other harassment signals (violent memes, name pollution, in‑person stalking).  

**Interpretive summary:**  
- The danger lies in **object‑ or setting‑specific triggers**, not explicit sexuality.  
- Automated filters miss these cues; the effect depends on individual sensory‑memory encoding.  

**Cognitive note (for auditors):**  
PTSD triggers often attach to **incidental sensory details**; repetition by recommender systems produces involuntary recall.  

**Governance interpretation:**  
| Vector | Possible Mechanism | Preventive Action |
|---|---|---|
| Commerce data | Retail‑purchase resurfacing | Apply decay clocks to historical purchase datasets |
| Device data | Ambient/camera embeddings for ads | Ban non‑consensual sensory data targeting |
| Model association | Cross‑modal embedding of object shape and sexual keywords | Test models for unintended sexualisation of neutral imagery |

**Ethical annotation:**  
> “No explicit content reproduced. Examples paraphrased to prevent retraumatisation or voyeuristic use.”  

**Reviewer guidance:**  
Analyse within full harassment context; focus on trigger precision and timing, not nominal offensiveness.

## 🧩 T3 — Safeguarding‑Report Crosslink → Referential Reminders and Boundary Erosion  

**Observed pattern:**  
- Digital content began to include **names, place references, and institutional cues** uniquely linked to a past safeguarding report.  
- These appeared in **drip‑feed fashion**, creating a sustained perception of surveillance or insider knowledge.  
- References aligned with: the **subject of the safeguarding report**, the **institution** receiving it, and a **geographical location** of significance.  

**Interpretive summary:**  
- Functions as **ambient harassment** through bureaucratic echo.  
- May arise from **data contamination** or **contextual inference** within recommender or moderation systems.  

**Risk characterisation:**  
| Risk Domain | Harm Description | Example Manifestation |
|---|---|---|
| Privacy integrity | Suggests access to confidential material | Use of niche location + subject initials in unrelated content |
| Emotional safety | Re‑exposure to case identifiers | Triggers distrust and hypervigilance |
| Governance legitimacy | Blurs boundary between private process and public algorithms | Undermines trust in safeguarding confidentiality |

**Governance interpretation:**  
| Possible Vector | Mechanism | Preventive Action |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset leakage | Institutional names in fine‑tuning data | Conduct data‑lineage audits and scrub proper nouns |
| Ad‑exchange cross‑feed | Profiling via contact metadata or location logs | Disable geo‑personalised ads for safeguarded cases |
| Targeted harassment | Manual signal injection by third parties | Strengthen injection‑detection and correlation analysis |

**Ethical annotation:**  
> “Specific names, institutions, and locations redacted. Patterns paraphrased to prevent replication of identifiers.”

## 🎭 T4 — Targeted Racial Dog‑Whistles → Policy‑Weighted Protection and Algorithmic Blind Spots  

**Observed pattern:**  
- Coded racial or ethnic insinuations appeared as humour or cultural commentary.  
- Severity spiked where critique of a state (e.g., Israel) was reframed as antisemitism.  
- Existing moderation models, weighted toward the **IHRA definition**, privileged state‑affiliated protection over lived antisemitic or anti‑Palestinian harms.  

**Interpretive summary:**  
- IHRA‑weighted moderation and Western bias produce **selective vulnerability**: survivors opposing state violence are flagged, while coded hate is ignored.  
- Users encounter **no protection pathway** because policy frameworks obscure racialised harassment.  

**Governance interpretation:**  
| Vector | Mechanism | Preventive Action |
|---|---|---|
| Policy model | Reliance on single IHRA definition | Adopt plural frameworks (JDA + academic cross‑community standards) |
| Algorithmic moderation | Keyword‑based flagging without context | Introduce discourse‑sensitive moderation calibrated for power dynamics |
| Appeal infrastructure | Single‑definition guidance | Multi‑perspective review boards including minority scholars |

**Impact focus:**  
- Advocacy mislabelled as hate while genuine racism ignored.  
- Creates **epistemic asymmetry**: state as protected subject, individual as suspect.  

**Governance recommendation:**  
> Convene cross‑community working groups of Palestinian, Israeli, and diaspora scholars to co‑author **dynamic antisemitism and anti‑Palestinian racism standards**.  
> Audit recommender systems for symmetric application of moderation thresholds.  

**Ethical annotation:**  
> “Examples paraphrased to avoid amplifying hate speech. Policy analysis drawn from comparative antisemitism frameworks.”

## ⚖️ Structural Asymmetry — Protection of the State over the Person  

**Core insight:**  
Moderation and policy infrastructures built on state‑centred definitions of antisemitism treat the *country* as the primary object of harm.  
The outcome: **critique of a government is policed more than hate directed at individuals.**  

**Observed effect:**  
- Survivor testimony or political critique removed while racialised abuse remains.  
- Jewish women opposing state violence find themselves **unprotected by definitions meant to protect them**.  
- Framework values the *sovereign entity* more than the *citizen subject*.  

**Governance implication:**  
| Fault line | Systemic outcome | Reform path |
|---|---|---|
| State‑centric definitions (IHRA) | Algorithmic over‑correction | Shift to human‑centric harm standards recognising intra‑community plurality |
| Policy translation gaps | Misclassification of survivor reports | Add intent and power‑context analysis to hate‑speech models |
| Epistemic imbalance | Nation‑state = protected class | Define protection around people, not governments |

**Ethical framing:**  
> “The purpose of antisemitism definitions must be to safeguard living individuals and communities, not to confer inviolability on geopolitical entities.”

## 🕸 Contextual Co‑Occurrence — Physical Presence and Digital Patterning  

**Observation summary:**  
During the same period as intensified digital harassment, **repeated vehicle presence** was observed outside the residence.  
- Vehicles shared similar make, colour, and sequential registrations.  
- Visibility most nights for several months; activity ceased after formal correspondence with government offices.  

**Analytic framing:**  
- Recorded as **temporal correlation**, not verified causation.  
- Contextualises how external stimuli can amplify perceived targeting.  
- Inclusion informs future inquiry into cross‑domain harassment patterns.  

**Governance implications:**  
| Risk domain | Possible mechanism | Preventive inquiry path |
|---|---|---|
| Physical‑digital coupling | Parallel surveillance or coincidence | Coordinate digital‑forensics and community‑safety reviews |
| Data interpretation | Misattribution due to overlapping stressors | Use trauma‑informed analysts for lived‑experience correlation |

**Status note:**  
> Reported to police at the time.  No ongoing presence.  Retained for timeline completeness.
