# 🕳️ Governance Black Hole  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*How responsibility for civic surveillance slips between regulators until no one is actually in charge.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Once a charity or NGO starts doing practical surveillance work — protest monitoring, evidence gathering, quasi-policing — you would expect multiple oversight bodies to step in.  

In practice, each regulator only sees a slice of the activity and assumes the others are handling the hard questions.  
The result is a **governance black hole**: surveillance and enforcement-adjacent work proceeds under charitable cover, with volunteers deployed into legal and physical risk, and no-one clearly responsible for their safety or for the systemic harms.

This node maps that abdication chain.

The cascade shows how each authority passes the problem on:

- Charity Commission: *“We don’t regulate operational tactics.”*  
- ICO: *“We don’t regulate mission scope or ideology.”*  
- Police/CPS: *“We don’t question how third-party evidence was collected.”*  
- HSE: *“They’re volunteers, not employees.”*  
- Electoral/foreign oversight: *“This isn’t party campaigning.”*  

What’s left is a **sphere of power with no supervising owner.**

## 🛟 Duty of Care and Oversight Risks  

Even if every actor involved has the best possible intentions, the black hole creates specific, predictable dangers:

### 1. Volunteers in Harm’s Way  

- **Physical risk:**  
  Volunteers are sent into highly charged protests or rallies, possibly facing counter-protesters, police operations, or crowd disorder.  
  Without formal risk assessments, legal-observer training, or coordination with event organisers and police, this can breach basic health-and-safety expectations for the charity sector.

- **Legal risk:**  
  Volunteers may inadvertently:
  - stray into **harassment** (repeated filming or tailing of individuals);  
  - mishandle **special-category data** (religion, political opinion) in ways that breach data-protection rules;  
  - become **material witnesses** in criminal proceedings without any legal briefing or support.  

  A responsible charity governance structure is expected *not* to expose volunteers to foreseeable legal jeopardy.

### 2. Sector Norm Violation  

In mainstream charity practice, there is a strong norm:  
> **You do not place volunteers in foreseeable danger — physical, psychological, or legal.**

Humanitarian observers, legal-observer groups, and community mediators typically rely on:

- Clear **codes of conduct** and **role boundaries**  
- **Formal training** for operating in public-order environments  
- **Insurance and legal backup**  
- Written **safeguarding and debrief protocols**

When a charity runs surveillance-style operations without matching that governance, it is out of step with its own sector’s duty-of-care culture.

### 3. Harm to Subjects and Bystanders  

Lack of oversight isn’t only bad for volunteers:

- Individuals filmed or profiled at protests can experience:
  - doxxing, employment or disciplinary action based on partial or biased footage;  
  - chilling effects on legitimate political speech;  
  - long-term data retention with no realistic way to exercise subject-access rights.  

- Errors, misidentifications or ideological bias are **nobody’s formal responsibility** to detect or correct.  

The black hole therefore generates **unaccountable harm** on both sides of the lens.

### 4. Strategic Fragility  

From an institutional perspective, this governance vacuum is also fragile:

- Any serious incident (volunteer injury, wrongful targeting, data scandal) can rapidly escalate to:
  - Charity Commission investigations,  
  - ICO enforcement, or  
  - civil litigation by affected individuals.  

The same structure that maximises short-term operational freedom maximises long-term liability.

## 🧿 Diagnostic Summary  

The governance black hole is not an accident; it is a **structural by-product** of:

- Outsourcing quasi-policing functions to civil society  
- Fragmented regulators with narrow mandates  
- Charitable language masking high-risk operational practices  

Even under the most generous interpretation of intent, the combination of **surveillance**, **weak duty-of-care systems**, and **volunteer labour** is inherently unstable and ethically brittle.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Governance Black Hole* is a diagnostic lens within the Polaris Protocol.  
It names the space where multiple regulators assume “someone else” is watching, leaving volunteers and targeted individuals to carry the risks of quasi-policing done under charitable cover.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
