# 🐝 Carceral Disability  
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*How “care” infrastructures reproduce custody logics.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Examines how disability management systems mirror carceral control.  
Across housing, healthcare, benefits, and safeguarding, disabled people are kept *safe but separate* — contained through bureaucratic visibility rather than supported through relational proximity.  
Shows how “out of sight, out of mind” functions as a moral cover for systemic neglect.

## 📑 Key Sections  

1. **Containment as Care**  
   - The administrative framing of protection becomes a rationale for confinement.  
   - Service design assumes immobility and obedience rather than agency.  

2. **Visibility Control**  
   - Systems track and record without recognising; surveillance replaces witness.  
   - Individuals become *case files* whose data stand in for personhood.  

3. **Geography of Isolation**  
   - Placement, transport limits, and inaccessible infrastructure act as walls.  
   - “Supported living” can mean social exile: too far to visit, too risky to challenge.  

4. **Loops of Dependency**  
   - Reduced mobility → fewer social ties → higher bureaucratic risk → more oversight → less mobility.  
   - The feedback loop sustains institutional dependence under the guise of care.  

5. **Proximity as Resistance**  
   - Rested, local, human connections counter the logic of remote management.  
   - Mutual-aid and community-care networks build porousness where the state imposes walls.

*🐝 Carceral Disability* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how disability policy and “safeguarding” architectures reproduce carceral logic under the guise of protection.
