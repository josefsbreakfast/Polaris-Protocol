# 🧱 Ideological Loyalty as Pyramid Scheme
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07
*Diagnostic satire unpacking the ideological economy of access within British professional networks.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
In elite institutions, ideological loyalty functions as a **multi-level marketing structure**.  
Access to power requires performance of belief; dissent leads to professional invisibility.  
This node dissects how loyalty economies transform moral posturing into tradable capital.

---

## 🧩 Key Features
- **Ideological Franchising:** Loyalty signals replace actual competence.  
- **Network Capture:** Mentoring loops sustain acceptable belief.  
- **Fear Laundering:** Converts suspicion into justification for obedience.  
- **Cultural MLM:** Virtue sold downstream; immunity distributed upstream.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content

### 1. The Upline of Power
Symbolic proximity to authority is marketed as moral achievement.  
Belief is optional; performance is mandatory.

### 2. The Downline of Conversion
Junior professionals internalise loyalty rituals as prerequisites for success.  
Conformity becomes a skillset; dissent a liability.

### 3. Product ≠ Product
The stated good (ethics, equality, progress) is merely cover for the real product: **access** and **immunity**.

### 4. 🪙 Market of Virtue
Moral alignment operates as currency.  
Ethics panels and diversity statements become boutique exchanges trading reputational credit.  
Virtue-trading stabilises hierarchies: moral language detached from practice, integrity reduced to aesthetic.
