# ♨️ Prosocial Nudge Burnout: Over-Nudging of the Same Individuals

*How repeated behavioural pressure concentrates on a small group until they emotionally, psychologically, or socially collapse.*

## 🛰️ Orientation
This note explains how behavioural-governance systems repeatedly target the same prosocial, empathic, or compliant individuals. Because these people respond reliably to subtle cues, systems unintentionally over-use them. The result is cumulative stress, emotional depletion, and eventual burnout. This belongs in the Counter_Nudge_Playbook because it describes an institutional failure pattern: nudging becomes over-nudging, which becomes harm.

## ✨ Key Features
• The most responsive people are nudged the most.
• Compliance creates visibility and increased expectations.
• Over-nudging produces emotional fatigue and collapse.
• Burnout is misread as non-compliance, triggering further escalation.

## How over-nudging happens
Nudges are designed as gentle behavioural prompts. However, they rely on the assumption that the target will adjust easily. The people who adjust first become the “proof of concept,” and institutions slowly begin to depend on them. Over time, these individuals are subjected to more prompts, more responsibility, and higher expectations. Their compliance becomes a resource.

## Concentration of behavioural pressure
Because antisocial or resistant individuals ignore nudges, systems place increasing behavioural weight on those who respond. This leads to disproportionate demands: an empathic worker calming down every meeting, a considerate housemate absorbing all domestic friction, or a socially conscious citizen modifying behaviour to compensate for others.

## The burnout trajectory
The early stages look like accommodation, then depletion, then emotional shutdown. Prosocial people often feel ashamed of burnout because they believe they “should be able to handle it.” When they finally reach a limit, their withdrawal or frustration is interpreted as instability or unreliability rather than exhaustion.

## Misinterpretation by systems
Once burnout begins, institutions may mistake it for non-compliance or increased risk. In stressed systems, emotional fatigue can be escalated instead of supported. This traps the individual in a cycle where the very traits that made them responsive become grounds for further intervention or scrutiny.

## Why over-nudging is dangerous
Over-nudging erodes wellbeing, removes autonomy, and creates a quiet moral injury. It teaches people that cooperation leads to exploitation. At scale, this produces disengagement: those who once upheld the system lose trust in it. For public services, this represents a loss of social capital and relational glue.

## A predictable outcome, not an accident
Burnout in this pattern is not personal weakness. It is a predictable outcome of an imbalanced behavioural governance design. Systems strain the most compliant individuals until they cannot continue, then misinterpret the collapse as a behavioural issue rather than exhaustion.
