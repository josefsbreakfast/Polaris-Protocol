# 📓 Field Log — Metadata Interference and Defamation Campaign  
**First created:** 2025-11-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-01  
*Chronological record of observed metadata anomalies and harassment escalation surrounding a June 2025 public event.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

This log records personal observations of persistent metadata interference, feed manipulation, and reputational content anomalies that began after attending a public speaking event in mid-June 2025.  
It is intended as a factual record of what was seen, when, and what steps have been taken to report or mitigate it.  
No causal claims are made regarding any individual, organisation, or author; the purpose is documentation for pattern analysis and accountability.

## 🗓️ Chronology  

| Date / Period | Observed Event | Immediate Effect | Actions Taken |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Mid-June 2025** | Attendance at public lecture / panel featuring the author of *Authoritarian Century* | Normal online activity beforehand | — |
| **Late June – Early July 2025** | Noticeable interference in personalised feeds; disappearance of event-related content and recording | Social feeds skew toward defamatory framing of the author | Internal note; attempted to locate recording for unrelated research need |
| **Mid-July 2025** | Escalation to targeted impersonation attempts and racialised “minstrel-show” style content across multiple platforms | Increase in digital harassment and algorithmic amplification | Formal report to relevant authorities (date + case reference if available) |
| **August 2025** | Launch of *Polaris Protocol* project | Created in response to the sustained harassment and data interference | Began structured documentation and forensic capture of anomalies |
| **Sept – Nov 2025** | Continuing metadata anomalies; narrative attempts connecting user activity to defamatory storylines about the same author | Persistent distortions in search and recommendation algorithms | Ongoing evidence capture; no further public comment |

### Observed Data-Broker Effects  

In parallel with the harassment timeline, search and recommendation feeds began surfacing material that appeared to stitch unrelated datasets together.  
The pattern suggests **cross-vendor data entanglement** — where shared brokers and analytics partners recycle identifiers across services.  
This produced search results and adverts that referenced specific institutional files and subcommittee evidence in improbable combinations.  
There is no technical reason these elements should co-occur unless they share an upstream data vendor or a deliberate narrative-seeding operation.  

These anomalies are being treated as indicators of **search poisoning** and **narrative orchestration**, not proof of direct institutional intent.  
Institutions may simply be the data source being re-used by third parties.  
The operational effect, however, is reputational: a coordinated story that models how digital ecosystems can be used to keep people quiet by re-contextualising their activity online.  

This observation aligns with the themes of *Authoritarian Century* — the weaponisation of the ordinary internet as a governance tool — and further supports the decision to document these interference patterns inside *Polaris*.

## 🧩 Current Status  

- Metadata interference and defamatory framing remain visible across certain social and search platforms.  
- No evidence suggesting direct involvement of the author whose work was discussed; interference appears to exploit public attention around them.  
- Objective: maintain verifiable records, avoid speculative attribution, and continue to liaise with reporting channels already notified in July 2025.

## 🧭 Notes for Ongoing Work  

- Continue timestamped screenshots and export of feed data where possible.  
- Keep communication with authorities and platforms factual and concise.  
- Avoid speculation about motive or origin until technical evidence confirms linkage.  
- Maintain separation between personal safety logs and analytic nodes inside *Polaris*.

*Field Log — Metadata Interference and Defamation Campaign* is a factual record created for archival and evidentiary purposes within the Polaris Protocol.  
It should not be read as accusation but as a structured observation set.
