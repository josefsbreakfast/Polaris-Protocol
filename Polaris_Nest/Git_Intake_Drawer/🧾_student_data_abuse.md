*How education’s duty of care became a data-extraction industry.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node exposes the structural transformation of student information from record-keeping to commodity.  
Between 2018 and 2025, testing boards, universities, ed-tech vendors, and government “innovation units” built a market that treats the daily behaviour of children and young adults as an investable asset.  

The euphemisms were *impact*, *personalisation*, *data-driven learning*, *AI for good*.  
The reality was the mass resale of names, grades, ethnicities, disabilities, keystrokes, moods, and routines—packaged as “insights” for advertisers, analytics firms, and political micro-targeters.  

> “We don’t sell the data; we license it.” — *College Board spokesperson, NYT 2018*  
> “Colleges buy student names for 47 cents apiece to appear more selective.” — *WSJ 2019*  

Every public statement about *responsible data partnerships* concealed the same equation:  
**student trust = market inventory**.  
This file records the evidence trail, the scale, and the legal and moral breaches that turned classrooms into capture devices.

## 🌐 Scale of Extraction  

| Sector | Approx. records per year | Data types | Primary channels |  
|:--|:--|:--|:--|  
| Testing & Admissions | 30–40 million profiles | Name, address, ethnicity, GPA, income, disability, religion | College Board & ACT licensing (“Student Search Service”) |  
| Learning Platforms | Billions of daily events | Clicks, scrolls, keystrokes, voice, location | LMS telemetry (Google Classroom, Canvas, Blackboard) |  
| Proctoring & Assessment | Millions of video/audio files | Face, gaze, voice, background | Remote-exam apps & AI monitoring |  
| Campus Infrastructure | Terabytes per semester | Wi-Fi pings, card swipes, CCTV, transactions | University IoT & security systems |  
| Broker & AI Pipelines | Hundreds of millions of records | Aggregated demographic + behavioural segments | Commercial brokers & AI training datasets |  

**Documented scale:**
- *Duke Tech Policy Lab (2023)* traced student-labelled datasets across hundreds of brokers.  
- *Human Rights Watch (2022)* found 90 % of education apps shared user data with advertisers.  
- FTC reports show major brokers maintaining profiles on virtually every U.S. consumer, minors included.  

Each academic term, a mid-sized university now produces **tens of millions of behavioural event rows per day**, feeding vendor dashboards marketed as “student success.”  

> “Data are the new oil, and universities must learn to drill responsibly.” — *Financial Times 2024*  

Behind that phrase lies an infrastructure of continuous capture whose volume exceeds the open-government data flows of entire ministries.

## 🕰 Historical Record — How the Market Was Built (2018 → 2025)

---

### 1️⃣ The Phenomenon — From Record-Keeping to Marketplace  

What began as routine admissions and research data-handling evolved into a commercial pipeline:  
**collection → contractual transfer → aggregation → licensing → AI training.**  
Each stage was framed as efficiency or innovation; each stage expanded exposure.

> “Educational data are the last untapped resource. We help institutions unlock their value.” — *Vendor marketing copy, 2023 procurement brief.*

By the mid-2020s the infrastructure spanned testing boards, admissions platforms, ed-tech vendors, universities, and data brokers.  
Consent was treated as a UX nuisance rather than a right.

---

### 2️⃣ Case Study — “The 47-Cent Sale” (*WSJ & Business Insider 2019*)  

The *Wall Street Journal* uncovered that the **College Board** and **ACT** were selling, or “licensing,” the personal data of high-school students for **$0.47 per record**.  
Buyers were elite universities seeking to inflate application numbers to appear more selective.

> “For 47 cents, the College Board will sell a student’s name, address, religion and intended major.” — *WSJ (2019)*  
> “Colleges purchase names of students they plan to reject to boost exclusivity.” — *Business Insider (2019)*  

Students received glossy recruitment letters from schools that would never admit them.  
It generated profit and prestige for institutions; humiliation and data exposure for the children.

> “I just stared at my computer and cried.” — Jori Johnson, student quoted in *WSJ 2019*  

---

### 3️⃣ How It Became Normalised — Bureaucracy as Laundering  

1. **Compliance Justification** — “We must collect data to improve outcomes.” Absence of data = negligence.  
2. **Procurement Outsourcing** — Private vendors gained controller-level access under “on-behalf-of” contracts.  
3. **Consent Erosion** — Educational purpose exemptions removed parental/student choice.  
4. **Analytics Expansion** — Behavioural metrics reframed as “insight.”  
5. **De-Identification Myth** — “Anonymised” datasets re-sold, trivially re-identifiable.  
6. **Regulatory Capture** — Governments adopted the same vendors for “digital transformation.”  

> “Data compliance became a Trojan horse for data exploitation.” — Polaris synthesis note

---

### 4️⃣ Market Practices — Broker Catalogues & App Leakage (*Hechinger Report 2022*)  

The *Hechinger Report* revealed that data brokers openly advertised lists tagged:  
> “Autistic children,” “Low-income households,” “Underperforming students.”  

Most records didn’t leak from schools but from **apps and scholarship sites** posing as educational helpers.  
A student checking eligibility for a bursary or using a “study quiz” could unknowingly authorise sale of their data to advertisers and political marketers.  

This is the **distributed surveillance architecture** of education: fragmented apps, unified exploitation.

> “We found brokers selling children’s learning profiles for pennies.” — *Hechinger Report (2022)*  

---

### 5️⃣ Institutional Framing — Innovation as Justification (*Universities UK & FT 2024*)  

Policy bodies reframed extraction as progress. *Universities UK* called it *“unlocking the value of data.”*  
The *Financial Times* praised universities for “learning to drill responsibly.”

> “Universities are sitting on an untapped data goldmine.” — *FT (2024)*  
> “Turning research data into insight is essential for national competitiveness.” — *UUK (2024 Insight Paper)*  

Such rhetoric transforms duty of care into a commercial licence.  
The language of **ethics and impact** becomes the marketing of **surveillance and sale**.  
Universities are positioned as “trusted intermediaries,” granting moral cover to what is functionally data brokerage.

## ⚙️ Technical & Legal — The Engine and Its Breaches  

---

### 1️⃣ Behavioural Data — The Hidden Layer of Educational Surveillance  

Beneath the demographic and admissions trade sits a deeper current: **behavioural telemetry**.  
Every movement of a cursor, every keystroke, every pause in a learning video becomes a datapoint.  

**Captured streams include:**  
- LMS logs: clicks, dwell-time, scroll depth, device IDs.  
- Proctoring feeds: face, voice, gaze, ambient sound.  
- Campus systems: Wi-Fi pings, card swipes, CCTV overlays.  
- “Well-being” apps: mood check-ins, chat transcripts, biometrics.  

> “Our analytics platform can detect disengagement within 30 seconds.” — *Vendor brochure, 2022*  

These are sold as *student-success metrics* or *early-warning systems*; in truth they are continuous surveillance loops.  
Students are never told that their **boredom, stress, or lateness** is being turned into a risk score or that those scores may feed hiring and admissions models.  

**Psychological telemetry has become a tradable good.**

---

### 2️⃣ Exposure Risk — How Commercial Access Becomes Public Endangerment  

When data are packaged for sale, *security* becomes a marketing option, not a duty.  

**Vectors of exposure:**  
- **Broker resales** — datasets resold indefinitely to new buyers.  
- **API leakage** — open developer endpoints returning live student IDs and grades.  
- **Data breaches** — entire proctoring or LMS databases dumped on forums.  
- **Inference attacks** — re-identification via school, postcode, activity pattern.  
- **Shadow matching** — brokers merge records with social-media profiles.  

> “It is easier to purchase children’s data from a broker than to obtain redacted documents via Freedom of Information.” — *Polaris field note, 2025*  

The consequence is physical: stalking, blackmail, targeted harassment.  
Educational surveillance creates the very exposure risk it claims to prevent.

### 3️⃣ Why It’s Illegal — Statutes and Frameworks  

#### 🇺🇸 United States  
**FERPA** prohibits disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records without consent; commercial resale is outside its permitted exceptions.  
**COPPA** forbids the collection of data from children under 13 without verified parental consent.  
**State laws** (CCPA/CPRA, Illinois SOPPA) explicitly ban the sale of student data.  
Labeling a transaction a “license” does not remove it from these statutes.

> “A sale by any other name is still a sale.” — California Attorney General Guidance (2021)

#### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom / 🇪🇺 European Union  
Under **UK GDPR** and **EU GDPR**, profiling of minors for marketing or behavioural prediction requires explicit consent and a documented lawful basis.  
“De-identification” does not exempt processors if re-identification is reasonably possible.  
ICO guidance (2021) warns that using children’s data for marketing or profiling **breaches fairness and transparency principles**.

#### 🌍 International Rights  
The **UN Convention on the Rights of the Child**, Articles 16 & 17, guarantees privacy and protection from exploitation; covert data trade violates both.  
The **OECD Privacy Guidelines** demand accountability and purpose limitation, both absent in the educational-data market.

**Summary:** across jurisdictions, the resale or repurposing of student data for profit is unlawful.  
The system persists only because enforcement is weak and terminology is evasive.

> “The law was written for filing cabinets; the abuse lives in the cloud.” — Legal scholar, 2024

## 💔 Moral Dislocation — The Betrayal of Duty of Care  

Every safeguard of education—trust, mentorship, curiosity—was repurposed as surface area for extraction.  
The rhetoric of *innovation* turned guardianship into brokerage.  
Universities and boards claimed to “empower learners” while quietly profiting from their trace data.

> “Turning research into insight.” — *Universities UK (2024)*  
> “Learning to drill responsibly.” — *Financial Times (2024)*  

These phrases describe not moral progress but **ethical inversion**: the conversion of care into capital.  
Students were taught to disclose themselves to learn; the system learned to monetise disclosure.  

It is a profound moral dislocation—education’s values hollowed out, their vocabulary re-used to market surveillance.  
The crime is not only technical but linguistic: the words *impact*, *well-being*, *personalisation* became camouflage for violation.

## 🛠 Quick Remediation Playbook  

**For institutions**  
- Publish all vendor contracts and data-sharing registers.  
- Add “no resale / no enrichment” clauses to every procurement.  
- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for all analytics tools and release them publicly.  
- Replace metrics of “engagement” with qualitative measures of care and trust.

**For regulators & advocates**  
- Audit testing and ed-tech vendors for unlawful resale under FERPA, COPPA, GDPR.  
- Require public disclosure of all “de-identified” datasets shared for research or AI training.  
- Classify behavioural telemetry from minors as *sensitive data* under law.  
- Enforce deletion and restitution: children’s data are not a renewable resource.

**For students & parents**  
- Exercise Subject Access Requests (SARs) to obtain personal-data copies.  
- Revoke consent where possible and demand deletion confirmations.  
- Document suspicious app behaviour or data requests and report to regulators.  
- Build peer education: privacy literacy is collective defence.

> “The opposite of innovation is not stagnation; it is integrity.” — *Polaris aphorism, 2025*
