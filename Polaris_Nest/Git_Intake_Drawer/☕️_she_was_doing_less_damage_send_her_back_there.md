on my last few edits, i am coming to the realisation that a particular bent of the messaging during yesterday's dopamine-depletion day, may have simply been targeted around "send her back to LinkedIn, she was doing less damage there!",  

which i suppose may be true...  

which is why i shall still be writing here.  

although i take your point.  

after all, *y not both*?  

with love --  

(because on some level, why are you continuing the surveillance if you're not getting something out of it? apple doesn't fall too far from the tree now, does it?)
