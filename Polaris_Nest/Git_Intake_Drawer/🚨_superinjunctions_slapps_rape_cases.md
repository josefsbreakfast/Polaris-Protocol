*Mapping how legal secrecy regimes erase survivors’ testimony and entrench silencing.*

## Introduction


This report maps how super-injunctions and SLAPP-like mechanisms intersect with rape cases in the UK. 
These mechanisms are intended for protection but can become tools of coercion and silencing, forcing survivors into invisibility and eroding trust in justice.


---
## 1. What Happens in Law


- Automatic anonymity for complainants in sexual offences (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992).  
- Courts can issue injunctions to block identifying detail.  
- Super-injunctions escalate this: silence on both the case and the fact there is an order.  


---
## 2. Survivor Experience


- Testimony treated as Crown property, not personal speech.  
- Survivor may be unable to share their own story without contempt risk.  
- Feels like "legalised lying": forced to act as though nothing happened.  


---
## 3. When It Functions as a SLAPP


- Purpose shifts from safeguarding to protecting institutions and reputations.  
- Survivor framed as risk to confidentiality rather than rights-holder.  
- Enforced through civil contempt and, for Crown servants, court martial.  


---
## 4. Enforcement Web


- MoJ / HMCTS: silence in civil courts.  
- Cabinet Office / Attorney General: coordinate restrictions across departments.  
- MOD: chain of command + Service Test, punishing disclosure.  
- Media: gagged via injunction register.  
- Regulators: blocked from acting on survivor complaints if material sealed.  


---
## 5. Duty of Care vs Reality


- Should: GDPR, safeguarding codes, whistleblowing protection.  
- Reality: orders override; survivors raising valid data security issues risk harassment, surveillance, reprisal.  


---
## 6. Harassment & Surveillance as 'Enforcement'


- Survivors monitored to prevent leaks.  
- Justified officially as protecting process/secrets, but functions as intimidation.  
- Extends SLAPP logic into daily life: exhausting, isolating, retraumatising.  


---
## 7. Why This Matters


- Convergence of SLAPPs and super-injunctions destroys trust in justice.  
- Survivors lose autonomy over their own testimony.  
- Silencing survivors undermines UK compliance with international obligations (IHL, CEDAW, Istanbul Convention).  


---
## Conclusion


Rape survivors face structural silencing in the UK when injunctions and SLAPP tactics overlap. 
What begins as protection becomes coercion, consolidating institutional power and erasing survivor voice.
