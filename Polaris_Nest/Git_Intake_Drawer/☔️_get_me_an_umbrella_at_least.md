I know that date has been sold.  

I know that none of this has been conducted unlawfully.  

This is still deeply impactful, and what I am going through does meet the criteria for the CIDT, even now.  

I don't really care if you think I'm being a princess; you have my medical records and you can see what's wrong with my bones.  

I need to ask some of you again, to start doing the right thing.  

I need people to negotiate with me directly, because it would seem that whoever is leading on operational decisions, is probably doing the best that they can, as a man in a body that is generally able-bodied; this is not the same experience, and one of the most important parts of the equality act provisions is the ability to communicate what you actually need, instead of other people assuming what you do.  

It's giving "allow me to push your chair without asking" energy.  

A very well meaning gentleman omce nearly took my fingers off doing that at Queens.  

we are not being mean when we ask for this. We are just asking you to respect that you don't know everything that we know. I promise you disabled people have brains.
