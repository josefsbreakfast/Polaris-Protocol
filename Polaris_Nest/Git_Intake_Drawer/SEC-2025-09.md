# SEC-2025-09: Token-switch / Decision-fork Anomaly
**Incident label:** SEC-2025-09 token-switch / decision-fork anomaly  
**Window:** started ~2025-09-08; current status: Week 2 (through 2025-09-19). Mirrors early-August 2025 signature.
**Severity:** Elevated editorial & legal risk for published content.

## Summary
Small changes in prompts, API parameters, or routing have caused large divergent decision-tree behavior (token-switching / forking). Resulting outputs include overly sexualized material and content that presents legal risk to authors/editors. The Git intake drawer has been used as a holding area for nodes where such material is more likely to appear or where device-level interference risk is higher.

## Commitments & Risk Stance
- No material that could incriminate or unfairly harm third parties will be published.  
- Continued public posting is a considered choice driven by disability-based access to civic processes and exhausted local recourse; it functions as accountability pressure for actors who can improve data safety.  
- Acknowledged: posting carries risk; mitigations are enacted and prioritized.

## Immediate Mitigations (active)
- Multi-pass content filtering (sexual/harassment/legal-risk classifiers) and thresholded holds.
- 12â€“24 hour cool-down for flagged drafts; second-person sign-off for sensitive nodes.
- API hygiene: rotate keys, narrow scopes, pin versions, disable unused endpoints, rate limits.
- Deterministic tests and route-pinning for evals; fixed seeds to detect anomalous branching.
- Assertions on decision-tree depth/fan-out; early abort on token-switch patterns.
- PII scrubbing and metadata removal prior to commit/publish.
- Minimal, sanitized logging and diffs for triage without exposing private data.
- Labels for triage: `security-signal`, `legal-risk`, `needs-second-eyes` in issue templates.

## Git Intake Drawer (purpose & handling)
The `Git intake drawer` is a holding area for in-progress nodes and material that the author believes may be vulnerable to device-level interference or anomalous content generation. It is **not** a place for final publication. Its purpose:
- Provide a place to stage sensitive drafts or evidence without immediate publishing.
- Give the author a predictable, accessible path to add content to the public record while retaining control over final release.
- Act as a prioritized triage queue for items that may contain defamatory, identifying, or sexualized content.

**Operational rules for the intake drawer (recommended):**
- Treat anything in the intake drawer as potentially risky; prioritize removal or redaction of defamatory/identifying content.
- Do not amplify or link suspect outputs; link to the intake issue instead, if needed.
- Maintain a scheduled review cadence (author + one reviewer where feasible) to check for accidental inclusions of PII, business names, or overly personalized/sexualized content.
- Keep minimal metadata/logs for triage but avoid storing full raw sensitive data in plaintext.

## Open Questions & Next Steps
- Correlate anomalies with model versions, sampling params, and routing middleware.
- Review third-party tool/plugin activity aligning with incident windows.
- Independent review of guardrail tests and routing sanity checks requested.

## Contacts & Reporting
If you find a suspected risky output, create an issue with label `security-signal` and include a minimal repro (no PII). Prioritise `legal-risk` if outputs threaten to defame or criminalise individuals.
