# 🕸️ The Grief of the Imperial Core  
**First created:** 2025-10-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*Reconciling moral injury, complicity, and loss within the heart of empire.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores the emotional and civic consequences of living inside the imperial core — the societies that built and still benefit from extraction.  
Considers how grief, denial, and moral dissonance manifest in everyday life: in academia, bureaucracy, and digital infrastructures.  
Asks how mourning empire might become an ethical project rather than a paralysing one.

3. **Colonial Aftercare** — how repair demands discomfort and redistribution.  
4. **Unlearning Dominion** — rituals of relinquishment and collective humility.  
5. **From Guilt to Griefwork** — pathways toward active mourning and responsibility.
