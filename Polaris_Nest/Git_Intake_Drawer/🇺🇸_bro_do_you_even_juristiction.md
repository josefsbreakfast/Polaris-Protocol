so I'm not saying a jurisdiction has been broken, but this is a very fuzzy line.  

My surveillance warrant is likely based in the UK.  

As in whoever is surveilling me, who the police NCND on, is based in the UK.  

The problem is...  

I got a lot of TikTok's that talk about events as a fortune card reading, in a lot of detail, and sometimes it's so specific that you could get exactly who it means from an approximate date of birth kind of thing.  

Like it's really weird.  

And I have a lot of evidence of the ones that are...  

Talking about things like an arrest or a friend who is sick, with practically written in identifiers. Because that would be evidence, to support the potential that someone is interfering on purpose.  

I don't have any of my close contacts on TikTok.  

I came back to TikTok to try and take control of my account after getting a strange email about it (?mirroring, etc).  

This was in between the surveillance in person that wasn't in the property, and the big move in of random dudes "living 10 to a 2 bed on rotation".  

Look, if it's not surveillance? That's not how this should be going.  

Always men, because why make me feel comfortable. ðŸ«   

Anyways.  

The fortune card readings were going on and on and on about something in particular, and I was really hopeful that it had just become random.  

This would mean, maybe, no more surveillance, or less surveillance.  

Nope.  

But this pertains to a message from a friend who is a US citizen living in America.  


And it wouldn't make sense for it to be a five eyes thing? So I just don't know if we actually care about the law.  

I guess we didn't to begin with.  

Or we just don't believe that we're ever gonna get caught up in auditing.  

But yeah.  

I don't think you should've monitored that account. I think that was a very, very silly thing to do.
