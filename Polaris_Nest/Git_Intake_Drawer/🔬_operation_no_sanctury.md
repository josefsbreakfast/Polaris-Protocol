*Diagnostic node on the Newcastle child sexual exploitation prosecutions and their institutional implications*

---

## 🧾 Overview  
Operation Sanctuary (later Shelter) was Northumbria Police’s flagship investigation into group-based child sexual exploitation in Newcastle (2014 onwards).  
- **Convictions (2017):** 17 men + 1 woman, guilty of rape, trafficking, and supplying drugs.  
- **Victims:** at least 22 young women and girls, many groomed through alcohol/drugs.  
- **National context:** parallels Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford; indicates systemic minimisation of early warnings.

---

## 📉 Timeline  
- **Pre-2014:** Local services note vulnerabilities; inconsistent police response.  
- **2014:** Northumbria Police launch Operation Sanctuary; intelligence sweep identifies extensive CSE network.  
- **2015–2017:** Trials across four court sittings.  
- **2017:** Guilty verdicts; sentences up to 20+ years.  
- **2018:** Joint Serious Case Review (David Spicer) published — finds earlier responses “lacked consistency and impact.”  
- **2018:** Controversy over police use of convicted rapist as paid informant.  

---

## ⚖️ Institutional Patterns  
- **Silence/inaction pre-2014:** Victim reports not escalated; safeguarding gaps.  
- **Post-2014 surge:** Multi-agency coordination, visibility in national media.  
- **Controversial tactics:** Paid informant undermined trust in safeguarding institutions.  
- **Review lessons:** Better inter-agency intelligence, need for cultural recognition of grooming models.  

---

## 🔍 Signals of Wider Systemic Issues  
- **Comparative failures:** Echoes of Rotherham (suppressed concerns, reputational protection).  
- **Intersection with Prevent:** Framing risk communities in terms of extremism vs exploitation blurred priorities.  
- **Exploitation typologies:** Drugs, debt bondage, sexual coercion — overlapping with county lines models.
