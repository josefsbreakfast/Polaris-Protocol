# Polaris Node: UK Constitutional Fault Lines (2025)

## Core Idea
The UK is experiencing a **multi-vector constitutional crisis**. 
Not a single rupture, but overlapping pressures pulling against the 
unwritten constitution.

---

## Nodes & Pressures

### ⚖️ Judiciary
- Increasingly drawn into **political disputes** (Brexit prorogation, Rwanda asylum policy, Gaza/Israel arms sales).
- Perceived **politicisation** risks public trust.
- Tensions around the **Human Rights Act** and **ECHR alignment**.

### 🏛️ Parliament
- **House of Lords**:
  - Contentious reform (Hereditary Peers Bill).
  - Lords flexing power against government (Data Bill defeats, Gaza debates).
- **House of Commons**:
  - FPTP produces **majorities on minority votes**.
  - Weakens sense of democratic legitimacy.

### 👑 Executive
- Expanding reliance on **secondary legislation** and Henry VIII powers.
- **Dominance over Parliament** amplified by large majorities.
- Perceived gap between **rhetoric vs. reform** (incrementalism).

### 🌍 International Law & Foreign Policy
- **Genocide Convention obligations** (re: Israel/Palestine).
- **ICJ rulings** forcing UK policy responses.
- NATO, Ukraine, and broader defence obligations add external pressure.

### 💷 Economy
- Weak growth, cost-of-living crisis, Brexit fallout.
- Public confidence in government competence eroding.
- Fiscal pressures limit reform capacity.

### 🏴 Devolution
- **Scotland**:
  - Asserting positions resembling foreign policy (e.g., IDF-linked boycotts).
- **Northern Ireland**:
  - Protocol tensions unresolved.
- **Wales**:
  - Growing calls for autonomy and constitutional clarity.

### 🗳️ Public Opinion
- Consistently **ahead of Parliament**:
  - >60% want Lords reform.
  - Majority support ending arms sales to Israel.
  - Broad support for stronger AI regulation.
- Disconnect fuels sense of **crisis of legitimacy**.

## Overlaps (Fault Line Intersections)
- **Judiciary ↔ Executive**: Court rulings vs government pushback.
- **Parliament ↔ Executive**: Lords resist executive dominance.
- **International Law ↔ Executive**: Gaza, arms sales, ICJ compliance.
- **Devolution ↔ International Law**: Scotland taking semi-foreign policy stances.
- **Public Opinion ↔ All Institutions**: Public appetite for change vs. cautious incrementalism.
