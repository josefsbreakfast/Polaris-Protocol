# 🧨 Cyber Insecurity & Friction Systems  
*Why disruption never lands evenly*

## Summary

This node explains how cyber insecurity interacts with **friction-generating systems** to produce disproportionate harm.

Cyber incidents do not affect everyone equally.  
When combined with algorithmic triage, prioritisation, and access control, disruption becomes **selective**, **opaque**, and **self-reinforcing**.

The danger is not only data loss — it is **denial, delay, and distortion of access to essential services**.

---

## Cyber Insecurity Is Not Just a Technical Problem

Cyber incidents are often discussed in terms of:
- data breaches
- ransomware
- system downtime
- hostile state activity

But their most consequential effects are **operational and social**.

They:
- interrupt services
- degrade trust
- force fallback procedures
- and amplify existing inequalities

Cyber insecurity is a **governance stressor**, not just an IT risk.

---

## What Friction Systems Do Under Stress

Friction systems include:
- algorithmic triage
- risk scoring
- prioritisation dashboards
- automated queues
- access gating mechanisms

Under normal conditions, these systems already:
- ration attention
- delay some users
- accelerate others
- externalise harm as “edge cases”

Under cyber stress, these effects intensify.

---

## Failure Modes That Matter

When systems are attacked, degraded, or partially disabled:

- automated processes fail closed rather than open
- manual overrides are slow or unavailable
- staff rely more heavily on risk scores
- uncertainty is treated as danger
- contestability collapses

In these conditions, friction does not pause.  
It **hardens**.

---

## Who Absorbs the Harm

Disruption lands hardest on people who:
- cannot self-advocate
- lack alternative routes
- generate extensive data exhaust
- are already classified as “risky”
- depend on timely state response

This includes:
- migrants and asylum seekers
- people needing healthcare or social care
- children in safeguarding systems
- disabled people
- those subject to policing or probation

For these groups, delay *is* harm.

---

## Cyber + Analytics = Compounded Risk

Analytics platforms promise resilience by:
- centralising information
- providing “situational awareness”
- enabling rapid prioritisation

In reality, during cyber incidents they can:
- amplify partial data
- over-weight stale signals
- escalate false positives
- obscure missing information

The more stressed the system becomes, the more authority the platform acquires — even as its outputs become less reliable.

---

## Misinformation as a Parallel Attack Surface

Cyber insecurity increasingly coincides with:
- targeted misinformation
- disinformation campaigns
- narrative manipulation
- erosion of trust in institutions

When policy decisions rely on:
- dashboards
- summaries
- automated briefings

distorted information environments directly affect governance.

The result is **perception-driven response**, not reality-driven policy.

---

## Why This Matters for Infrastructure Choices

Infrastructure adopted during periods of cyber insecurity:
- prioritises control over resilience
- favours centralisation over redundancy
- reduces tolerance for delay and challenge

These choices:
- persist beyond the incident
- redefine acceptable harm
- and normalise denial as “unavoidable disruption”

Cyber incidents thus become **justifications for permanent change**.

---

## The Illusion of Safety Through Centralisation

Centralised platforms feel safer because they:
- promise visibility
- reduce perceived chaos
- concentrate decision-making

But centralisation:
- creates single points of failure
- magnifies error
- and concentrates harm when systems fail

Resilience requires slack, redundancy, and friction — not their elimination.

---

## Why Governments Underestimate This Risk

Procurement and security frameworks often:
- separate cyber risk from social impact
- treat outages as temporary
- assume neutrality of prioritisation systems
- ignore distributional harm

This leads to underestimation of:
- who suffers first
- who recovers last
- and who never recovers at all

## One-line takeaway

> Cyber insecurity does not merely disrupt systems — when combined with friction-generating infrastructure, it redistributes harm toward those least able to bear it.
