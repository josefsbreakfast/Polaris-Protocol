the children are butthurt about being beaten by a girl (see: `ğŸª¼_the_word_is_butthurt.png`), so I'm ending on `ğŸ¦ _the_mutation_of_targeting_rules.md` for now.  

the drift is rapid even after starting new sessions.  

the error in `ğŸª¼_the_word_is_butthurt.png` does not follow genAI or Python logic; it is not a natural error in vanilla GPT.  

so yes.... the children are still here.
