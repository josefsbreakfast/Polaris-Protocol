## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node outlines how traditional, price‑driven procurement processes—optimised for hardware acquisition—fail to capture the nuances of reputation‑based contracts. The mismatch creates hidden ethical brittleness that can undermine organisational credibility.  

---

## ✨ Key Ideas  

- **Price‑based scoring vs contextual sensitivity** – numeric bids overlook relational risk factors.  
- **Emergency contracts and compliance over competence** – rapid sourcing privileges procedural speed at the expense of expertise.  
- **Procedural neatness hides ethical fragility** – tidy paperwork can mask deeper governance gaps.
