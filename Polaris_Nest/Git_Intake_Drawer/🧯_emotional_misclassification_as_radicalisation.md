# 🧯 Emotional Misclassification as “Radicalisation”  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How Prevent and Channel routinely misinterpret ordinary emotional expression — grief, fear, anger, trauma, identity formation — as indicators of extremism, creating structural harm for young people and racialised communities.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Prevent assumes that emotions can signal “radicalisation.”

But emotional states are:

- contextual,  
- developmental,  
- cultural,  
- trauma-linked,  
- neurologically diverse.

Prevent reads emotion through **risk templates** that flatten human feeling into behavioural suspicion.

This node explains how emotional life — particularly non-white, non-male, non-neurotypical emotional life — becomes misclassified as pre-crime.

## 🧩 Structural Analysis  

### **1. Prevent treats intense emotion as instability**  
Prevent risk logic flags:

- anger,  
- grief,  
- fear,  
- anxiety,  
- political distress,  
- identity confusion,  
- emotional overwhelm,

as indicators of:

- ideological vulnerability,  
- “unsettled worldview,”  
- susceptibility to influence,  
- potential extremism.

Emotion ≠ ideology.  
But Prevent conflates them.

---

### **2. Cultural emotional expression is misread as volatility**  
In many cultures:

- grief is loud,  
- anger is direct,  
- affection is public,  
- politics is emotional,  
- solidarity is embodied.

Prevent’s baseline — white British emotional restraint — misreads this as:

- “unstable,”  
- “distressed,”  
- “erratic,”  
- “threat-adjacent.”

Cultural life becomes risk category.

---

### **3. Trauma is read as ideological shift**  
Trauma survivors often:

- hyper-focus,  
- spiral online,  
- catastrophise,  
- express big emotion,  
- display heightened sensitivity.

Prevent interprets this as:

- radicalisation pathway,  
- “direction-of-travel,”  
- ideological escalation.

Trauma becomes criminalised feeling.

---

### **4. Neurodivergence is reframed as ideological fixation**  
Autistic and ADHD young people may:

- deep-dive into niche topics,  
- show intense focus,  
- speak bluntly,  
- express emotion atypically,  
- misread social tone.

Prevent reframes these as:

- “obsession,”  
- “escalation,”  
- “ideological intensity.”

Neurodivergence becomes ideological suspicion.

---

### **5. Grief is framed as ideological instability**  
During global crises (e.g. Gaza, Ukraine, Kashmir):

- Arab, Jewish, Muslim, South Asian, Eastern European youth  
experience collective grief.

Prevent misreads:

- crying,  
- rage,  
- solidarity,  
- political visibility

as radicalisation.

Emotion becomes danger.

---

### **6. Adolescence is misinterpreted as extremism pathway**  
Teenagers are:

- angry,  
- confused,  
- identity-exploring,  
- boundary-testing,  
- politically curious.

Prevent categories impose adult risk logic on adolescent behaviour.

Adolescence itself becomes suspicious.

## 🧪 Case Window (Patterns)

*Synthesised from research, tribunal rulings, and NGO reports — no personal data.*

- A grieving teen flagged for “emotional volatility.”  
- Autistic youth flagged for “obsessive interest in geopolitics.”  
- A Jewish girl flagged for fear of rising antisemitism.  
- A Black teen flagged for rage about racism.  
- A Muslim boy flagged for praying more during family crisis.  
- ADHD teens flagged for late-night doomscroll spirals.

Emotion → Prevent risk logic → Channel consideration.

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• Emotional life becomes state-regulated**  
This undermines freedom of thought and freedom of feeling.

### **• Trauma survivors avoid institutions**  
They fear their own emotions will be criminalised.

### **• Neurodivergent people are pathologised as threats**  
A civil rights violation.

### **• Racialised communities lose expressive freedom**  
Their grief and anger become dangerous.

### **• Democracy requires emotional plurality**  
Prevent collapses this into a narrow, white-coded emotional norm.
