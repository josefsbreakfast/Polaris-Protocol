as soon as a woman says 

that the men fucked something up

all of a sudden thats too much?

it could be 10 men

it could be 100 men

it doesnt matter that we live our lives entirely underneath them by their own legal rulings

it doesnt matter how many women and girls are raped

forced to carry children

forced to deliver, potentially die, 

in acts that they never consented to.

it doesnt matter that most of us are raped or sexually assaulted in our lifetimes,

or how many of is before we are even adult enough to use our bodies for our own pleasure.

none of that matters.

it diesnt matter that they get to tell is our entire lives what we should or should not do,

beat us, cajole us, take every last inch of life from us.

none of that matters.

because we said they did something wrong for once.

we must be punished.

this is our world.

but dont tell they i told you.

we must be good gorls,

which translates:

"we must shut the fuck up right now".
