## 🧭 Orientation  
Investigates how politeness disguises hierarchy.  
Clever women are often described as “intense,” “over-analytical,” “formidable.”  
Each term sounds complimentary but functions as damping language: praise calibrated to reduce threat.

## 🗣 1. The Lexicon of Comfort  
Euphemisms keep the social atmosphere stable.  
They protect listeners from recalibrating their sense of self.  
Intellect is recoded as temperament to preserve existing rank.

## 💬 2. Tone as Translation  
When brilliance emerges from a woman or other marginalised voice, audiences translate content into personality.  
Argument becomes attitude; analysis becomes “feeling.”

## 🧠 3. De-Euphemising Practices  
- Name the intellect directly.  
- Cite precision and originality, not charm.  
- Refuse to “soften” self-description for social survival.  
Direct language re-establishes parity.
