# 🗒️ Field Note — Conversation Drift & Anchors
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Observing scope drift and meta-artifacts during an extended exchange.*

---

## 🌀 Observed Drift
- Began with MI5 scoping → weak points mapping.  
- Moved into waterproofing metaphors (damp coursing, sump pumps, hydrology).  
- Shifted to venue co-presence (NEC, Wi-Fi, data twinning).  
- Anchored on specific events (TI 2016, Nottingham 2022, Birmingham 2024).  
- Tangled with spoofed email / harassment complaint.  
- Expanded to professions targeted (healthcare, law, teaching).  
- Converged on anti-SLAPP Section 17 (Oct 2025).  
- Meta: screenshots of ChatGPT buffering logged as anomaly.

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Co-presence signals weak on their own.  
- Public oversharing builds provenance; privacy can be exploited.  
- Registered professions structurally targeted.  
- Anti-SLAPP reform marks inflection point.  
- Anchors vs narratives must be kept separate.  
- AI disfluency resembles surveillance glitch → meta artifact.

## 📍 Anchors captured
1. TI 2016 — Edgbaston Stadium.  
2. Nottingham 2022 — Adjacent Wi-Fi + spoofed email.  
3. Birmingham 2024 — Norman Finkelstein seminar.
