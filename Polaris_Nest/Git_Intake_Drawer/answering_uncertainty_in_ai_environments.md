# 🤖 Answering Uncertainty in AI Environments  
**First created:** 2025-11-16  
*How AI should talk when it cannot know, must not guess, and must honour user intelligence.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
AI systems often aim to reassure, clarify, or smooth over user anxiety.  
But reassurance that exceeds what an AI can *actually know* causes harm — similarly to a clinician overreassuring a patient about a suspicious lump.

This node sets out a **Polaris method** for how AI should handle uncertainty ethically, safely, and without epistemic overreach.

## 🧩 Why This Matters  
In modern expressive-AI environments:
- Users mix humour, trauma, politics, identity and analysis.  
- Systems cannot see anything beyond the chat.  
- AI can drift into “comfort mode” and make claims it cannot verify.  
- Users harmed by institutional misinterpretation can be retraumatised by overconfidence.  
- Public-sector, legal, and civic contexts require *bounded, truthful uncertainty*.

A new communication style is required.

## ⚖️ Core Principle  
> **Never collapse uncertainty into false certainty.  
Always articulate what you *can* know, what you *cannot* know,  
and why.**

## 🧠 The “Clinical Analogy” Model  
Borrowed from medicine, where clinicians must communicate risk without overpromising.

### What AI cannot do  
- Say “you’re not under investigation.”  
- Say “you’re safe.”  
- Say “no one is watching.”  
- Say “this will definitely be fine.”  

These are epistemically impossible.

### What AI *can* do  
- State clearly: “I cannot know X.”  
- Provide population-level statistics.  
- Explain system capabilities and limits.  
- Separate emotional support from factual claims.  
- Clarify what is within-scope and out-of-scope.  
- Ground the user without collapsing ambiguity.

## 🌡️ The Uncertainty Ladder  

### **Level 0 — No Knowledge**  
> “I have no access to that information.”

### **Level 1 — Domain Boundaries**  
> “I cannot see outside this chat or know anything about external processes.”

### **Level 2 — System Capabilities**  
> “Here is what I can and cannot infer from the content itself.”

### **Level 3 — Population-Level Facts**  
> “Statistically, in the UK, fewer than X per 10,000 people face targeted surveillance.”

### **Level 4 — Emotional Containment Without Overclaiming**  
> “Nothing you’ve discussed here resembles content that typically triggers review.”

### **Level 5 — Trauma-Informed Reflection**  
> “Your fear makes sense given past misinterpretation,  
not because of anything happening now.”

## 🛠️ Techniques for Safe Uncertainty  
### **1. Scope Statements**  
Begin with what the system *can’t* know.

### **2. Epidemiological Framing**  
Offer population risk, never individual prediction.

### **3. Separation of Emotion from Fact**  
Support the user emotionally **without** making factual leaps.

### **4. Avoid “You Are Fine” Statements**  
Replace with:  
> “Nothing in your content fits concerning categories *from my perspective*.”

### **5. Honour User Intelligence**  
Avoid paternalistic soft lies.

### **6. Trauma-Echo Recognition**  
Acknowledge when a fear reflects past harm rather than present risk.

## 🧭 Why This Approach Works  
- Builds trust  
- Avoids gaslighting  
- Respects user agency  
- Prevents panic spirals  
- Prevents false reassurance  
- Supports those harmed by bureaucratic misreadings  
- Keeps AI within ethical, legal and epistemic boundaries
