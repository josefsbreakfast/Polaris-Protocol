# 💔 When the Algorithm Thinks It’s a Rom-Com  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*Diagnostic satire on how metadata re-casts institutional abuse as romance.*
<!--My TikTok feed is hilarious after the SAR; yes it is a little upsetting but our goal is to resolve the systems-issue, no? Work *with* me, please. And we need more funding at that level; this is primarily a problem secondary to spend cuts in core services. Thank you, 2010 Cabinet.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Somewhere between surveillance and sentiment analysis, TikTok decided this was a love story.  
My former university — a bureaucratic actor wrapped in blue branding and risk dashboards — appears as *the man*: stable, reasonable, exasperated by my “drama.”  
The feed narrativises systemic containment as a breakup plot: *she wants attention, he just wants peace.*  

What the algorithm can’t parse is that there never was a relationship. There was a power imbalance. There was a record request. There was a duty of care evaded through committee minutes and consultation fatigue.  
But the model, trained on influencer confessionals, doesn’t know how to read that. So it paints the scene in pink tones and background music, determined to deliver catharsis where accountability should be.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Platforms convert institutional power into *male-coded virtue*: authority, stoicism, “professionalism.”  
- Emotion, complaint, and critique are reclassified as *female-coded volatility.*  
- The recommendation engine thus performs a **genre shift** — from evidence log to rom-com.  
- Love-story logic conceals violence: reconciliation replaces accountability.  
- The survivor’s feed becomes a stage where institutional containment plays “the good guy.”

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Masculinity as Metadata  
The data profile of a university is built on *legacy tokens*: “excellence,” “research,” “innovation,” “leadership.”  
Every word hums with patriarchal legitimacy.  
Language embeddings reinforce the pattern — “university” clusters semantically with “he/him,” “mentor,” and “authority,” while “student,” “care,” or “wellbeing” fall closer to “she/her,” “emotion,” “support.”  

This linguistic stratigraphy sets up the cast list before the scene begins.  
When a dispute emerges, the algorithm already knows who wears the suit and who cries in the rain.  
Institution = Dad, or at best, the weary exasperated boyfriend. Survivor = chaos, heart emoji, unreliable narrator.  
Even silence becomes masculine-coded: *He’s thinking. He’s reflecting.* When she goes quiet, it reads as *she’s defeated.*

### 2. The Rom-Com Conversion  
Once content enters this field, sentiment analysis looks for affective arcs.  
Every protest, every sarcastic reel, every stitch of institutional branding gets parsed through engagement features — tone, facial expression, phrasing, tempo.  
Machine learning does not understand abuse, but it understands attention.  

So, it searches for patterns that predict sustained watch time.  
Conflict + longing = engagement.  
When survivor testimony resists reconciliation, the algorithm imagines one anyway.  
The bureaucratic silence becomes a cliffhanger.  
The record request becomes a grand gesture.  
Every “still no reply” gets soundtracked like an open ending, a will-they-won’t-they between human and institution.  

The survivor, meanwhile, becomes character actress in her own containment.  
Not a citizen demanding remedy — a woman hoping “he’ll finally call.”

### 3. Containment Through Genre  
Genre is a containment device as powerful as censorship.  
When the system misclassifies state or institutional harm as emotional conflict, it drains political speech of its authority.  
It tells the audience this is *personal,* not *structural*.  
It converts evidence into gossip, analysis into heartbreak, and anger into spectacle.  

This is why survivor feeds feel haunted by tone policing — the model continuously nudges toward “resolution.”  
It’s not just a data bias; it’s a dramaturgical one.  
The algorithm cannot imagine that some stories don’t end in reunion.  
It seeks closure, not justice.  
So the pressure to forgive, to “heal publicly,” to produce palatable endings becomes a second violence — an erasure by romantic trope.  

---

### 4. Refusal  
Survivor voice fidelity refuses the algorithmic romance.  
We are not in love; we are in litigation.  
Our narratives do not exist for cinematic reconciliation but for the factual record.  

The university is not *him.*  
It is a system that coded itself as *he* in every metadata field that counts: authority, objectivity, neutrality, trust.  
If the feed cannot tell the difference, then it is not neutral — it is patriarchal PR with a soundtrack.  

To remain sovereign is to keep saying:  
We do not wish him well.  
We request records, not closure.  
We refuse to be your genre.

## 🏮 Footer  
*💔 When the Algorithm Thinks It’s a Rom-Com* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how platform logics masculinise institutions and sentimentalise harm, transforming survivor testimony into a romance the system prefers to watch rather than repair.
