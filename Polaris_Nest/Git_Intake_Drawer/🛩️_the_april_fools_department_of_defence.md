*RAF as century-long satire and philosophy of defiance.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Founded on 1 April 1918, the Royal Air Force remains the UK’s longest-running institutional joke that became real.  
It proves that irony can achieve flight.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Gravity as a Treasury directive:** to be challenged, not obeyed.
- **Aesthetic realism:** if you can’t fix it, make it sublime.
- **Public-private levitation partnerships:** airshows as community outreach and budget camouflage.

## 🧿 Analysis  
The RAF exists as a paradox: born of bureaucratic prank yet sustained by precision.  
Every sortie is a statement that containment and curiosity can co-exist.  
It flies to prove the universe can be bullied into cooperation.
