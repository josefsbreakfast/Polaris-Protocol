# 🧪 International Law vs Safety Classifiers — Why Provisional Measures Break AI  
**First created:** 2025-11-17  
**Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*How automated moderation and safety logic misinterpret legally accurate statements about genocide risk, IHL, and ICJ provisional measures.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explains why discussions of **genocide law**, **provisional measures**, **civilian-protection duties**, and **grave-breach frameworks** repeatedly trigger misclassification in AI safety systems — even when the language is:

- factual,  
- legally correct,  
- normative in the humanitarian sense,  
- and non-incendiary.

The mismatch arises because **international law operates on an entirely different logic** than current safety classifiers, which are biased toward:

- American political framing,  
- literal interpretations of phrasing,  
- sentiment heuristics,  
- avoidance of “political persuasion,”  
- and zero-tolerance treatment of verbs related to conflict or resistance.

You end up with a surreal situation where quoting the ICJ can trigger the same flags as incitement.

This is a structural problem, not a user behaviour.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Why IHL discourse confuses safety systems  
- The legal meaning of genocide risk vs algorithmic interpretation  
- Why “provisional measures” sound like commands to a machine  
- How safety layers collapse moral clarity into “mobilisation”  
- Differences between American political safety logic and international law  
- Survivor-safe articulation of legal facts

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. International Law Uses “Strong” Verbs  
IHL and genocide prevention rely on verbs such as:

- prevent  
- protect  
- cease  
- refrain  
- ensure  
- prohibit  
- comply  
- allow  
- provide  
- cooperate  

These are **normative requirements**, not political mobilisation.

Safety classifiers often read such verbs as:

- instructions to act,  
- “calls,”  
- commands,  
- escalatory phrasing,  
- political advocacy.

Thus:  
A person quoting the Genocide Convention looks, to the system, like someone issuing directives.

This is an interpretive failure on the system’s part.

---

### 2. Provisional Measures = Machine Panic  
The ICJ issues **provisional measures** when genocide is *plausible* and urgent:

- “take all measures within your power to prevent”  
- “ensure the preservation of evidence”  
- “enable humanitarian access”  
- “refrain from acts that fall under Article II”

These are formal legal imperatives.  
Safety layers mistake them for:

- calls to action,  
- political mobilisation,  
- directives to communities,  
- escalation rhetoric.

The mismatch is categorical:  
**one is law; the other thinks it is protest language.**

---

### 3. Safety Systems Are US-Centric  
Models are disproportionately trained on:

- US electoral discourse,  
- US extremism frameworks,  
- US media tones,  
- US moderation guidelines,  
- US political verbs (“organise,” “mobilise,” “resist”).

Thus:

- “resistance” = extremism  
- “urgency” = mobilisation  
- “harm prevention” = political pressure  
- “obligation” = call to action  

European, UN, and Commonwealth legal norms are not properly represented.

---

### 4. British Pragmatics Add Further Distortion  
British speech uses:

- understatement,  
- moral clarity delivered dryly,  
- sarcasm,  
- irony,  
- compressed rhetorical structures,  
- elliptical phrasing.

Safety layers misread:

- humour as hostility,  
- clarity as escalation,  
- despair jokes as incitement,  
- indirect critique as political persuasion,
- legal reference as advocacy.

Thus:  
The more legally accurate a British speaker is,  
the more likely their phrasing is misclassified.

---

### 5. Survivor Expression Gets Double-Misread  
Survivors often speak with:

- compressed affect,  
- direct moral boundaries,  
- emotional efficiency,  
- tone clipped by trauma memory,  
- avoidance of rhetoric-as-performative-padding.

Safety classifiers interpret this as:

- volatility,  
- agitation,  
- mobilisation,  
- leadership signals,  
- “high-risk sentiment.”

Nothing could be further from the truth.

---

### 6. Why Provisional Measures Break AI  
Because the system cannot parse the distinction between:

**a. describing a legal duty**  
vs  
**b. telling someone they must act**

Examples:

> “The ICJ has ordered Israel to take measures to prevent genocidal acts.”  
AI hears: “You are issuing a political command.”

> “The Genocide Convention prohibits harm to protected groups.”  
AI hears: “You are framing someone as a perpetrator.”

> “Civilian protection is mandatory.”  
AI hears: “You are instructing others to intervene.”

The user is stating facts.  
The system interprets fictional intent.

---

### 7. Structural Causes  
- AI cannot model *who* is being addressed.  
- AI cannot reliably distinguish citation from speech-act.  
- AI cannot recognise legal categories outside US case law.
- AI collapses humanitarian norms into political categories.  
- Safety layers interpret verbs literally.  
- British humour scrambles sentiment models.  
- Thin-data overweights survivors.

This is a **systems failure**, not user behaviour.

---

### 8. How to Safely Express Legal Realities  
Use:

- descriptive framing,  
- passive voice (occasionally),  
- neutral verbs,  
- explicit attribution to institutions.

Examples:

> “According to the ICJ provisional measures issued in January 2024, states are required to prevent acts that fall under Article II of the Genocide Convention.”

> “International humanitarian law prohibits intentional harm to civilians.”

> “The legal framework emphasises civilian protection as a non-negotiable duty.”

These are accurate, safe, and non-mobilising.

It maps the structural mismatch between humanitarian law and automated safety logic, highlighting how legally accurate statements are misinterpreted as politically mobilising in thin-data, culturally misaligned systems.
