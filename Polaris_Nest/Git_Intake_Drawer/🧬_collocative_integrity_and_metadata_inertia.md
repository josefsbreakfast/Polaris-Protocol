*When a library’s logic outlives its morality.*

## 🧭 Orientation
“Collocative integrity” was Melvil Dewey’s proudest design principle: keep similar subjects together so readers could browse across related knowledge.
But when “related” was defined through the worldview of the 19th-century white Protestant male, that integrity became an inheritance of bias.

## 🧩 Key Features
- **Structural persistence:** obsolete or harmful categories remain to preserve catalogue order.
- **Semantic adjacency:** once a subject is placed near its “kin,” the proximity survives long after ideas evolve.
- **Ideological fossilisation:** discredited fields (e.g., *eugenics*) remain enshrined beside legitimate sciences.
- **Metadata inertia:** systems resist re-indexing because every record depends on the old hierarchy.

## 🔍 Analysis
The eugenics class in Dewey is the perfect metaphor for how AI systems keep harmful associations “for compatibility.”
Deleting the node breaks the system; keeping it breaks the world.

*Collocative Integrity & Metadata Inertia* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.
It traces how moral errors in classification become technical dependencies — showing that to change knowledge, one must first rewrite its scaffolding.
