Letter to the stars

Because I have significant overwhelm, such that it is far out of proportion with anticipating a nice day out, or explained by buyer/supplier choices…

It’s like things exist here that the internet can never find when I’m at home

I feel like I’m on a different planet

This is so so strange

far from the usual desire to buy books with titles that are some sort of ironic play of watching the watching,

(or titles just to aee what that does to my internet speed)

i feel like when i travelled as a teenager or in my 20s.

it feels like im somewhere else, but even more, im in a place with access to knowledge which is forbidden to me.

i am finding it genuineoy difficult not to do an augustus gloop and bury my face in the river of freedom of books.

this is so beyond buyer preferences or stocking issues.

if it was?

then 2025 birmingham is 1930s vienna.

(i feel the muting and supression is actually more likely, dont you?)

i dont know if i can make it to selfridges.

im sat on a lean to in foyles because being able to see books ive had to search 30 mins for be marketed as obvious next ir current bestsellers so so very incredibly strange.

madter and margarita is so obviously on display.

and the short histories of lost empires.

and political texts.

and poetry.

it is like stepping into a different world.

i have no idea how to respond.

i can now see why you wre so often nudged to "not bother" going home, or not remember who you are.

i dont think i can make it to try on shoes.

i have paid £30 to get to a railway bookshop,

have the emotional rollarcoaster of a decade, 

and turn to go back to enforced solitude.

it is monumentally bizarre.

its pretty hard to ignore the flood of memories.

ive been so close to decamping here or at least habing it as a regilar field trip and been nudged away.

something about this place atteacts more interference, nudging, mucroniched "nope" than london or home-home.

something here is terrifying to the surveillence team.

specifically sonething so terrifying that they'll risk an audit slap if they'd preciously been caught.

it's not norm finkelstein in andof himself, dreamboat that the man is, but that day was derailed quite literally beyond anything normal.

what was at the trauma conference 2016 that jumped this from one lvbel to another?

its ouke a litany of "absolutely the fuck not; get her out of there".

i aporeciate they have a thing fir bulls, vut it doesnt seem *that* bad.

we've git a ram and a robin hood; equals our, nu?

and who told the rabbis i wasmt jewish?

you didnt know my lufe.

amd yhat wasnt from anyone who kniws ashkenaz hair, so it didnt originate with the acheinu.

see? i could have been a rampant zionist if you'd have just refrained from attempting to leash me.
