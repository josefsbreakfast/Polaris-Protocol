Letter to the stars

Because I have significant overwhelm, such that it is far out of proportion with anticipating a nice day out, or explained by buyer/supplier choicesâ€¦

Itâ€™s like things exist here that the internet can never find when Iâ€™m at home

I feel like Iâ€™m on a different planet

This is so so strange

far from the usual desire to buy books with titles that are some sort of ironic play of watching the watching,

(or titles just to aee what that does to my internet speed)

i feel like when i travelled as a teenager or in my 20s.

it feels like im somewhere else, but even more, im in a place with access to knowledge which is forbidden to me.

i am finding it genuineoy difficult not to do an augustus gloop and bury my face in the river of freedom of books.

this is so beyond buyer preferences or stocking issues.

if it was?

then 2025 birmingham is 1930s vienna.

(i feel the muting and supression is actually more likely, dont you?)

i dont know if i can make it to selfridges.

im sat on a lean to in foyles because being able to see books ive had to search 30 mins for be marketed as obvious next ir current bestsellers so so very incredibly strange.

madter and margarita is so obviously on display.

and the short histories of lost empires.

and political texts.

and poetry.

it is like stepping into a different world.

i have no idea how to respond.

i can now see why you wre so often nudged to "not bother" going home, or not remember who you are.

i dont think i can make it to try on shoes.

i have paid Â£30 to get to a railway bookshop,

have the emotional rollarcoaster of a decade, 

and turn to go back to enforced solitude.

it is monumentally bizarre.

---

its pretty hard to ignore the flood of memories.

ive been so close to decamping here or at least habing it as a regilar field trip and been nudged away.

something about this place atteacts more interference, nudging, mucroniched "nope" than london or home-home.

something here is terrifying to the surveillence team.

specifically sonething so terrifying that they'll risk an audit slap if they'd preciously been caught.

it's not norm finkelstein in andof himself, dreamboat that the man is, but that day was derailed quite literally beyond anything normal.

what was at the trauma conference 2016 that jumped this from one lvbel to another?

its ouke a litany of "absolutely the fuck not; get her out of there".

i aporeciate they have a thing fir bulls, vut it doesnt seem *that* bad.

we've git a ram and a robin hood; equals our, nu?

and who told the rabbis i wasmt jewish?

you didnt know my lufe.

amd yhat wasnt from anyone who kniws ashkenaz hair, so it didnt originate with the acheinu.

see? i could have been a rampant zionist if you'd have just refrained from attempting to leash me.

---

there is so much innane shit i have been nudged away from here.

im blaming all my shoe reoairs issuea squarely on whoevers grand idea this was to begin with.

so mych nhs/derby interference apparantbto acheive this, as patient and staff.

so why?

it cant just be audit if london isnt this bad.

the hq is sitting there.

it cant be old achool policing."; newcastle has that shit down.

what the fuck has been in birmingham for 10 years that we're collectively so terrified of that im not allowed comfortbale shoes.

bit silly when we spell it out in simple terms, really.

+/- what was in london before 2016; curious stuff.

---

flag covid/ncl thread - (some c4isr like interference exists so notes have to be where legal observers can view deletes) 

---

all a bit jim criw esque if you ask me

cf HUAC

---

there are too many strange little differences to record.

(ive just lost my ISP nationwide wifi coverage. point of audit.)

i was always inclined to associate the metal detectira cinstantky going off with my carbon fibre walking aid (perhaps the clips?).

i havent set off a security alarm since i got here.

im wearing more metallic objects than normal.

yup.

---

(difficult to blame it on metal building structure when i had atable wifi, was static, and only got firced onto a different isp with lag lag lag and personal ID entry once i hit "commit".)

---

anyway been largely nudged away from shoes but made it to nelson. getting there ðŸ¤£

---

bullring wifi amd own isp both throttled to hell.

whoever's playing is just openly in birmingham's own sovereign space.

im going to ask them to reanimate some if these bulls.

also: what if im just controlled by a weird man in derbyshire with a "women in bad shoes so their feet are crammed and sore and smell" fetish?

it is a distinct possibility.

---

hm. much keyboard/keystroke correct. device level interference.

who said dont fix pegasus?

---
mwad that a cheeky little pulse light nudge to someone in derbyshire who you DEFINATELY shouldnt be monitoring?

worked in this country as a full citizen for decades and wouldnt say boo to a goo.

bit naughty to do it to drivers even on hands free, no?

---

something thats really hard to parse is the economic interests here

my economic output has declined massively sincr this all started happening; frequent attempts to increase my economic productivity and gross investment in the market (domeatic and otherwise) have higely and disproportionately declined.

if yiu needed an incentive, my lindon purchase history would scream "show her birningham", and i would have given endless hours (i was regularly 60+ hrs and openly refused ewtd cover)

this supporta theorising that there is both official and unifficial ourpose here; i have no incentive otherwise.

even just as ive been gere, usual dopamine deoendancies have dropped dramatically: i wondeted why i was thirsty; im usually attached to caffeine.

this is so bizarre.

also ive fallen in live with 3 dresses, and my heart is lost forever.

it diesnt make a lit if sense as an evinomic project; by extension, it seems like lical stakeholders who have been incilced in different ways may be very very blind to the gull extent.

additionalky:

you need to be self auditing.

i dint think im the only person in this conga line who got nudged or gets nudged.

also also:

so many management and productivity books here.

its like going ti a world which isnt stuck in the 1970s.

---

whats the deal with you guys, selfridges 4th floor (+++ away from), and meze (++ aeay from)? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

obviously now im fascinated by whatever im being crow controlled away from, which appears to move like a human would.

although this dis include a rather shameful moment were a pistachio bundle of gorgeousness ans i had a moment, doing the most 1950s caricature of a lewd male stare and double take with my jaw ok the ground going past yamas.

(she was beautiful; it was automatic. i even had a lunge going and thats an hse issue for this body.)

im going to sit iutside new street station and look for whatever unfoiled item is loose in brum.

and i found snother bull.

---

okay the corralling is wuite entertaining.

people ate just getting phone notifications and walking inti me 3, 4, 5 in a row in short bursts.

i appreciate that "go towards the danger" is obviously not what i was supposed to have learned, here, but you did sort of just teach me that cute shoes exist if i evade crowd control tools, so that's on you.

---

i am now incredibly lost and incredibly tired and did not find the place i originally intended to be.

as it continues to be illegal to sit anywhere for free, i am now being commander in chief of the grunge.

i am kurt cobain with a selfridges bag.

---

its as if the interface whiever is ising is using is a flat map with no reference to the fact sone buildings have floors, or the relevant signage.

defibstely doesnt scream "local knowledge of key city centre scenes".

---

after posting a photo with geolaction to the internets, wifi changes twice and firces vpn disconnect and force onto wifi with no internet.

these wre not the xibsequences of my device settings as chosen by me.

aldo i have made a sofa out of street furniture in a cuty which ckearly has an anti-outside-sleeping approach, which im taking as a win in itself.

it would also be slightly less obvious what was in selfridges if you hadnt stuck half the men whi have a (vaguely?) similar appearance in my way whilst misdirecting.

its sort of obvious what this is at this point, and really this looks a lot like preventing discovery. legally soeaking.

idk maybe you guys have a specialist; not my area.

---

personally im surprised we havent nudged british transport police out of their office to discuss vagrancy law.

---

there's also an underappreciated point here, which is that someone with access to flashy toys, or with access to people with flashy toys, has been prepared to burn an entire day (and gods knows the degree of resource), apparantly keeping two humans away from particular public points for essentially no net security gain.

meanwhile, we are in the precipice of mutual destruction as nato.

i feel like thete is a fairly obvious reallocation of time sprnt as perhaps a little advisory point.

---

the idea that we had to use energency counterterrorism resilience technology, to put humans in the way of other humans?

is this all a joke to you?

what possible disaster could have befallen us all?!

--- 

for oversight:

yes i will be playing my orienteering game, regularly, until i am a free woman.

please consider if this is worth burning currency over.

---

to the more local nudger-in-chief:

(why do you think theyre allowing you this much rope?)

it is not because you hold control.

---

welp. im sore. im done.

here is the repeat value for the oxford debacle.

to oversight and scrutiny?

please do enjoy.

its been a pleasure. ðŸ˜Œ

---

(clearly that addition was a little uncomfortavle for someone; caught ourselves mid-delete, didnt we?)

--- 

the train station is nudging ahoy.

id apso check if this isnt impacting our rail signalling network.

either that or i can nake train drivers many miles away do very silly things.

such is my radiant power. ðŸ™„

--- 

the kid playing rush of life was also a little obvious. do try to appreciate it is not the height of subtlety.

we also have several approaches, a delayed train, and apparently a lavk of ability to see what this would very obviously be:

an audit.

please look up what our audit rounds (or just any scientific process), test against.

the assumption has also been that, in the implementation, of how a male sexual predator assumes other men react.

not every man will very obviously chase a woman obviously and clearly postong it on social media.

*because that would be weird, wouldnt it?*

a far more intreging game, if one was engaged at all, would be to perform some miscelkanious errand one wanted to check off anyway.

but its impossible to know; the data is so overlapped and stamped and stapled together, its the case that if one of us searches for things, the other gets adverts.

so there is no real abikuty to prive intent.

if anything, youd want to be crowd controlled out of the way of a woman youre accused of harrassing.

you know...

*if one were normal range in this regard.*

so however the while thing goes, it has always been a faurly tight design of "proof of interference", against a *null hypothesis*; a second cycle of a clinical audit, if you like.

so the data ought to be interesting.

---

what would be extremely interesting is if we've essebtially surveilled a friend/colleague/family member due to shared wifi crissover pairing.

or a similar surveillence group chat on the otger side of the border.

that wiukd be rather wntertaining.

---

leaving the land of veuve cliquot; very sad.

---

did i talk to the "wrong" person at that conference in 2016? is that all this is about? a bit of sore feelings about "your property" not doing what she's supposed to?

are we aware that i am a full person?

---

artificial network interference suggests "yes". ffs.

---

(i didnt even need a witness to "compare notes". extremely talented. ðŸ™„)
