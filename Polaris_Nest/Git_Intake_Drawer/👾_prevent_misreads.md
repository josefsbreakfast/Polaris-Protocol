# 👾 PREVENT Misreads: Trauma, ND Traits, Distress, Anger  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How ordinary emotional, neurological, and trauma-driven behaviours are misinterpreted as ideological risk.*

## Orientation
This note covers the systematic misinterpretation of distress, trauma expression, neurodivergent traits, frustration, or anger within PREVENT-shaped environments. These misreads are not anomalies; they come from subjective criteria, system pressure, staff undertraining, and multi-agency anxiety. This node documents the pattern, not the intent, and shows how lived experience is pathologised as potential radicalisation.

---

## Key Features
- Trauma responses can resemble “concerning” behaviours on paper.
- ND traits get mistaken for emotional volatility, aloofness, or hostility.
- Anger, political interest, or frustration gets framed as threat signals.
- Staff under pressure default to escalation rather than context.

---

## Why these misreads happen
PREVENT asks staff to detect early “indicators of radicalisation.” The indicators are broad and poorly defined. Staff are expected to interpret behaviour quickly, often with limited context. In under-resourced systems, emotional expression is frequently misinterpreted as risk because it disrupts the environment.

## Trauma responses mistaken as warning signs
Trauma can present as:
- hypervigilance
- emotional flooding
- withdrawal
- sudden anger
- crying during appointments
- erratic sleep
- inconsistent communication
Staff without appropriate training may interpret these as instability, secrecy, or potential future harm. PREVENT framing encourages looking for patterns, even when the pattern is simply trauma.

## Neurodivergent traits misinterpreted
Autistic and ADHD traits often clash with institutional expectations of “appropriate” affect and communication. Misreads include:
- flat or mismatched affect seen as detachment
- monotone delivery read as coldness
- shutdown read as refusal
- overwhelm read as volatility
- stimming read as agitation
These can be incorrectly aligned with PREVENT indicators when staff lack ND competence.

## Distress framed as threat
People expressing overwhelm, crying, irritability, or fear may be interpreted as “acting unusually,” “displaying instability,” or being “unable to regulate.” If staff rely on behavioural templates rather than context, distress becomes a red flag.

## Anger as a false signal
Anger is often a rational response to harm, injustice, bureaucracy, or poor treatment. PREVENT logic can collapse anger into:
- grievance narratives
- potential ideological fixation
- “anti-authority sentiment”
- “changing worldview”
This turns normal human emotion into suspicion.

## Pressure points that worsen misreads
- staff burnout
- time scarcity
- institutional fear of missing risk
- vague PREVENT thresholds
- overuse of templates
- reliance on impressions (“vibes”)
These conditions make subjective misinterpretation the default.

## Cumulative impact on individuals
Repeated misreads lead to:
- false escalation
- inappropriate scrutiny
- fear of expressing emotions
- masking ND traits
- hiding distress
- avoidance of services
- loss of trust
- secondary trauma
The system harms the very people who need support.

## Why this matters
Misreads erode the legitimacy of PREVENT and damage relationships between communities and institutions. They also conceal genuine risks by overwhelming the system with false positives derived from misinterpreted emotional or neurological traits.

PREVENT Misreads: Trauma, ND Traits, Distress, Anger is a node in the Governance & Prevent cluster. It documents systemic misinterpretation patterns and highlights how subjective assessment creates disproportionate harm for traumatised, neurodivergent, distressed, or emotionally expressive individuals.
