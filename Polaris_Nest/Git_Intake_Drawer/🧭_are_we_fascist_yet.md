# 🧭 Are We Fascist Yet?  
**First created:** 2025-11-09  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-09  
*A UK-specific diagnostic for recognising protofascist drift before collapse.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines the civic moment when governance performs democracy but operates through containment.  
Polaris treats “Are we fascist yet?” as a **forensic question**, not a slogan: a live test of legality, economy, and care as systems of control.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Security Overreach** — surveillance normalised as protection.  
- **Economic Immunity** — elites fined, not tried; citizens fined, not heard.  
- **Civic Chilling** — dissent recoded as extremism.  
- **Performative Parliamentarism** — ritual debate masking capture.  
- **Care as Containment** — welfare and health used to discipline rather than support.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1  The British Modality  
Our authoritarianism arrives in paperwork, not parades.  
Where continental fascisms shouted, the British variant **redacts** — procedural, data-driven, polite.  

### 2  Protofascism Defined  
Measured against Eco’s *Ur-Fascism* and Griffin’s palingenetic loop, the UK sits in the **protofascist band**:  
legal asymmetry, nostalgic nationalism, militarised bureaucracy, privatised control.  

### 3  Mirror Ideologies  
| Axis | Description | Expression |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| **Future-Worship Fascism** | Progress as deity, inevitability as virtue. | Accelerationism, “innovation without scrutiny.” |  
| **Nostalgia-Fascism** | Mythic past as refuge. | Imperial revivalism, heritage populism. |  

The UK oscillates between them — techno-futurism executed by institutions still mourning empire.  

### 4  Containment Gradient

### 5  Public Oversight Hook  
> **FOI and OSINT keep the threshold visible.**  
> Each request and audit anchors legality in daylight.  
> Transparency is not bureaucratic housekeeping — it is anti-fascist hygiene.
