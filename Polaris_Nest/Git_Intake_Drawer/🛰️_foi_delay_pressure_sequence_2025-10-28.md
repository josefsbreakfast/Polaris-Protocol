# 🛰️ FOI Delay Pressure Sequence — 2025-10-28  
**First created:** 2025-10-28 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-28  
*Record of escalation patterns, physical strain, and emotional read-outs surrounding current FOI correspondence.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Field note documenting the interaction loop between physical condition, digital environment, and institutional response pattern on the date of **2025-10-28**.  
Captures the convergence of algorithmic noise (TikTok tarot feed), somatic distress, and intensified emotional pressure following FOI-related correspondence.

## 🧩 Observations  

- Morning: issued follow-up email regarding FOI and cybersecurity matter.  
- Afternoon–evening: notable uptick in algorithmic “avoidant partner” content despite deliberate disengagement from such themes.  
- The feed repeatedly displayed **relationship-narrative material** (imagined interpersonal / romantic storylines).  
- After a period of acute stress and visible crying, the algorithm served **even more emotionally charged content**, apparently keyed to that response — implying adaptive feedback to distress expression.  
- Physical state: continuous pain; decompression when supine comparable to ~3 ml IV morphine.  
- Emotional baseline: fatigue, irritability, guarded humour.  
- Cognitive read: possible professional or institutional interference intended to destabilise focus before FOI deadline.  
- Social atmosphere: heightened narrative manipulation around “love story” trope; perceived attempt to re-frame procedural issue as emotional drama.  
- Environmental factor: lack of accessible housing contributing to chronic stress load and mobility limits.  
- General inference: escalation coincides with formal data-access activity; likely designed to exhaust or discredit.

## 💬 Reflexive Notes  

> “I don’t want to be played like this. I just want to be happy with my life and I can’t really be happy when I’m constantly in pain.”

- Hyper-vigilance remains adaptive given long-term pattern of non-disclosure by involved institutions.  
- Current strategy: prioritise physical recovery and maintain strict factual communication in all FOI correspondence.  
- Emotional aim: disengage from algorithmic narratives; focus on verifiable documentation.
