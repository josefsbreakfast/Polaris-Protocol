# 📜 Incomplete Search Behaviour (Diagnostics)  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-18  
*How to identify, evidence, and frame the systematic signs that an institution has performed a partial, silo-limited, or flawed search in response to FOI or SAR obligations.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Most institutions do **not** intentionally withhold data.  
They simply:

- search the wrong system,  
- search only a single mailbox,  
- rely on the memory of an under-briefed manager,  
- forget the vendor chain,  
- exclude cloud logs,  
- interpret your request too narrowly,  
- miss metadata holders entirely.

Incomplete searches generate the contradictions, gaps, and anomalies that later feed into:

- **ICO escalation**,  
- **vendor mapping**,  
- **institutional panic**,  
- **triangulated FOI/SAR logic**.

This node maps the diagnostic signs that a search was *not* complete —  
even if they assert it was.

# 🧩 The Nine Diagnostically Reliable Signs of an Incomplete Search  

These are the indicators you use when constructing an ICO-ready evidence packet.

---

## **1. Narrow Interpretation of the Request**  
The response focuses on:

- one team,  
- one mailbox,  
- one system,  
- one date window,  
- one keyword.

Language markers include:

- “We searched the X team’s files…”  
- “We checked our main system…”  
- “We reviewed the email account of…”  

This is not a full search.  
It is a *subset* search disguised as a full one.

---

## **2. Absence of Metadata in the Response**  
If the SAR does *not* include:

- system identifiers,  
- timestamps,  
- environment tags,  
- processor codes,  
- audit logs,

…it means they did not query the underlying systems.

This is the clearest sign an institution only searched *documents*,  
not *data processing pathways*.

---

## **3. FOI and SAR Describe Different Data Universes**  
Example:

- FOI: “We do not use automated profiling.”  
- SAR: contains **risk scores**, **classifiers**, or **automated summary fields**.

This is a textbook incomplete search in at least one direction.

---

## **4. Missing Internal Correspondence**  
A genuinely full search should include:

- internal emails,  
- minutes,  
- Slack/Teams logs (where applicable),  
- decisions,  
- instructions,  
- searches performed.

If these are absent,  
you know they didn’t search organisational communications.

---

## **5. “We Found Nothing” Replies for High-Activity Periods**  
If the period in question includes:

- a complaint,  
- a process,  
- a review,  
- a risk event,  
- institutional contact,  
- public or legal activity,

and **no internal correspondence exists**,  
the search was incomplete.

Bodies never produce *zero* internal traffic during crises.

---

## **6. Absence of Vendor Records**  
If the organisation uses:

- cloud systems,  
- analytics tools,  
- behaviour-scoring engines,  
- ticketing systems,

and none appear in the SAR or FOI response,  
this is a **vendor blindspot** (Node 26)  
and indicates an incomplete search.

---

## **7. Discrepant Timestamps**  
If:

- the SAR’s timestamps do not match their stated processing practices,  
- processing happened outside office hours,  
- logs appear in batch cycles,  
- there are timezone mismatches,

…it means another system was involved that they did not search.

---

## **8. Abruptly Short Responses**  
Any response under ~2–4 pages for a complex case is suspicious.

Institutions generate:

- drafts,  
- queries,  
- escalations,  
- clarifications,  
- internal instructions.

If none of these appear,  
the search was almost certainly limited.

---

## **9. “We Searched What You Asked For” (But They Didn’t Ask Clarifying Questions)**  
A key diagnostic marker:

If a request is broad or ambiguous,  
the institution has a duty to seek clarification.

If they do *not* seek clarification  
and produce a very narrow answer,  
that is a predictable incomplete search.

---

# 🧨 How Incomplete Search Produces Systemic Contradictions  

Incomplete searches surface as:

### ✔ Event–Record Inconsistency  
e.g.,  
You have lived experience of an event →  
They have zero internal records of it.

### ✔ FOI–SAR Mismatch  
One response names a system the other doesn’t.

### ✔ Timeline Drift  
Gaps around critical dates.

### ✔ Metadata Absence  
Signals they did not search the systems that actually processed your data.

### ✔ Vendor Absence  
Signals they did not check third-party or cloud environments.

These contradictions become **ICO-grade evidence**.

# 🔧 How to Present Incomplete Search Without Accusation  

Use gentle phrasing such as:

- “This may indicate the search was not sufficiently wide.”  
- “There appear to be discrepancies between your systems’ metadata and the search results.”  
- “Could you confirm whether cloud environments or vendor-held data were included in the search?”  
- “There may be additional systems that were not captured.”

Each line signals the problem  
without provoking institutional defensiveness.

# 🧠 Key Insight  
> **Incomplete search behaviour is not malicious —  
> it is structural.  
>  
> But it reveals where the truth is hiding.**

In Polaris, “incomplete search” is the first layer of forensic illumination.

It shows which systems exist,  
which vendors are involved,  
which silos were bypassed,  
and where internal contradictions originate.
