# 🧟 The Zombie Data Genocide  
**First created:** 2025-10-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-29  
*How populations become administratively present yet materially disposable — a genocide pathway encoded in datafied governance.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
**Zombie Data Genocide** names a modern genocide pathway in which a group is rendered **hyper-visible as data** while being **systematically excluded from care and protection**.  
Instead of overt annihilation only, harm is effected through **categorisation, eligibility architectures, and algorithmic neglect**, producing mass attrition that is deniable as “administration.”  
This node integrates the Polaris concepts of **The Data Empathy Gap** and **I Am a Zombie Data Subject** at population scale.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Administrative Overkill, Material Under-care** — exhaustive records; absent services.  
- **Category Weaponisation** — schemas that make aid non-applicable to the targeted group.  
- **Algorithmic Attrition** — risk scores and eligibility rules orchestrate slow eradication.  
- **Plausible Deniability** — deaths framed as by-products of policy, not purpose.  
- **Evidence Without Redress** — the system stores proof of harm it is structurally unable (or unwilling) to remedy.  

---

## 🔍 Analysis / Structure  
Classic genocide models emphasise dehumanisation, organisation, and extermination. In datafied states, these phases are **translated into information logistics**.  
The targeted group is catalogued meticulously; then **service gates** (health, housing, legal standing, movement) are tuned so their survival becomes administratively impossible.  
Because the system is “only following rules,” responsibility diffuses — lethal outcomes appear as naturalised *administrative failure* rather than intent.

## 🧮 Pipeline Diagram — From Visibility to Elimination  

```mermaid

    C[Classification & Registration] --> Q[Quantification & Risk Scoring]
    Q --> G[Eligibility Gating]
    G --> W[Withdrawal of Services]
    W --> A[Administrative Containment]
    A --> M[Mass Attrition (avoidable deaths)]

**Interpretation:** The loop recycles via “policy refresh” that preserves the schema while claiming reform.

## 🧬 Ten Data-Era Stages (Polaris adaptation)  
1. **Classification** — target defined in data terms (flags, codes, watchlists).  
2. **Registration** — comprehensive capture (biometrics, addresses, case IDs).  
3. **Quantification** — metrics and scores frame the group as cost/risk.  
4. **Segmentation** — siloing into exceptional pipelines (“complex,” “non-standard”).  
5. **Gating** — eligibility logic excludes; proofs required are impossible to meet.  
6. **Withdrawal** — services paused, delayed, or terminated by “policy compliance.”  
7. **Containment** — movement limited via housing, benefits, or digital controls.  
8. **Exposure** — heightened vulnerability (healthcare denial, unsafe work, homelessness).  
9. **Attrition** — predictable, preventable deaths accrue.  
10. **Denial** — harms re-coded as administrative necessity; audits ignore outcomes.

## 🧪 Indicators & Red Flags (Audit Use)  
- Rising **case-file volume** without closures for a defined group.  
- Eligibility **exception rates** far above baseline.  
- **Service latency** spikes co-located with mortality/morbidity upticks.  
- Recurrent use of labels like “**non-engaging**,” “**failed to attend**,” “**unverified**” despite abundant records.  
- Absence of an **“else: redesign schema”** clause in core workflows.  

---

## 🛠️ Countermeasures (System Governance)  
- **Outcome-anchored audits** — tie policy renewal to demonstrable reduction in avoidable deaths.  
- **Empathy Infrastructure** — mandatory “recognition → obligation” triggers at every data capture.  
- **Undefined-as-Signal** — treat category failure as a *system bug* forcing process redesign.  
- **Right to Human Override** — legally protected, time-bound human intervention when automated gating blocks survival-critical services.  
- **Duty of Care Telemetry** — public dashboards tracking care delivery, not just records held.

## 🧷 Relationship to Existing Polaris Nodes  
- **[🧩 The Data Empathy Gap](./🧩_the_data_empathy_gap.md)** — micro-to-meso mechanism that scales to population harm.  
- **[🧟 I Am a Zombie Data Subject](./🧟_i_am_a_zombie_data_subject.md)** — individual failure mode inside this larger pattern.  
- **[🧭 The Anti-Populist](./🧭_the_anti_populist.md)** — civic temperament that resists memetic compression and flags early-stage category abuse.

## 🌌 Constellations

*The Zombie Data Genocide* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a contemporary genocide pathway where populations are exhaustively recorded yet structurally denied survival, enabling lethal outcomes under the cover of administration.
