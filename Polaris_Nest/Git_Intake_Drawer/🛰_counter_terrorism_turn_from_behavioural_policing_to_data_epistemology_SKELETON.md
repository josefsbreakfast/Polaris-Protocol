# 🛰 Counter-Terrorism at the Turn — From Behavioural Policing to Data Epistemology  
**Draft status:** Skeleton | **Intake drawer:** /Big_Picture_Protocols/System_Governance/🛰_Counter_Terrorism_Turn/  
*When the boots-on-ground story meets the dashboard.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Brief scene-setting on the historical frame:  
- Post-9/11 behavioural logic (PREVENT, Shawcross, “pattern of life” heuristics).  
- Transition moment: data as terrain rather than tool.  
- Context: first UK PM to treat data science as central to policy.

---

## 📚 Part I — Behavioural Policing  
- The psychology and behavioural-insight era.  
- How “radicalisation indicators” became metrics.  
- Limitations: intuition disguised as evidence.  

### Key examples  
- PREVENT logic and Shawcross Review.  
- Behavioural science as policy fashion.

---

## 💾 Part II — Data Epistemology  
- Rise of data-literate governance.  
- GCHQ’s quiet ascendancy; MI5/MI6 culture clash.  
- “Data as terrain” — modelling systems rather than people.

### Case-study placeholders  
- PDS / NPCE cloud platform.  
- CONTEST 2023 and AI focus.  
- NPDAB minutes: data as strategic asset.  
- Home Office “Data Integration & Exploitation” procurement.  
- National AI Strategy & ONS Data Vision.  

---

## 🔄 Part III — The Inversion  
- Threat perception inversion: auditing the system itself.  
- Economic and cultural displacement (hardware → compute).  
- Institutional emotions: pride, fear, re-branding.

---

## ⚖️ Part IV — The Ethics Horizon  
- When data epistemology becomes dominant, what new oversight forms emerge?  
- Meta-regulation, transparency, audit loops.  
- Public literacy and media lag.

---

## 🧩 Appendices / Attachments  
- Case-study catalogue (expandable table).  
- Timeline of structural reforms (2015–2025).  
- Key quotations / public statements (GCHQ, CDDO, NPCC).  
- “Nerds’ Revenge” cultural sidebar.
