# 🧩 Premature Resolution — The “What Do You Want?” Trap  
**First created:** 2025-10-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*When accountability is reframed as closure.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores how institutions and interlocutors deflect responsibility by demanding future-oriented answers from those still awaiting redress.  
Maps the psychological and procedural manoeuvre that turns structural repair into personal aspiration.  
When you are asked *“what do you want?”* while injustice remains unacknowledged, the question becomes a form of narrative coercion: a demand for emotional reconciliation before material repair.

## ✨ Key Sections  

1. **Framing Devices — The Question as Containment**  
   The polite inquiry *“what do you want?”* functions as a closure mechanism.  
   It reframes an ongoing accountability process as a negotiation of preferences, implying that structural wrongs have already been settled.

2. **Emotional Labour and the Demand for Forgiveness**  
   Survivors are pressured to convert evidence into empathy; outrage into aspiration.  
   The emotional demand is clear: be visionary, not accusatory — even when harm remains unacknowledged.  

3. **Bureaucratic Closure Loops**  
   Institutional systems convert refusal into pathology: a “failure to move on.”  
   The deflection protects the organisation from scrutiny by converting grievance into a private blockage.

4. **Refusal as Continuation of Due Process**  
   Refusing to answer *“what do you want?”* is not obstinacy.  
   It is procedural integrity — the maintenance of unresolved accountability until due process and restitution occur.
