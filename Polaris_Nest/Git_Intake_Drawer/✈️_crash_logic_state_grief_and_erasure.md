*When accident becomes governance: the choreography of loss in authoritarian systems.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Every state cultivates its tragedies, but some learn to weaponise them. In modern Russia and its antecedent systems, the plane crash is not just mechanical failure; it is a narrative device. Each “accident” erases a problematic cluster — singers, generals, dissidents — and simultaneously rehearses the ritual of endurance. The repetition creates a governance style in which **grief itself becomes a proof of stability**.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- Accident as **state theatre** — tragedy choreographed into legitimacy.  
- **Erasure through sympathy** — mourning neutralises scrutiny.  
- **Continuity signalling** — instant reconstruction as moral triumph.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The Semiotics of Crash  
From the 1950 VVS team to the 2023 Wagner jet, every wreck functions as a stage for official resurrection. The pattern: immediate denial, sudden investigation, ceremonial mourning, and rapid narrative overwrite. What looks like chaos is instead a **stability algorithm** — a feedback loop in which destruction demonstrates control.  

### 2. Grief as Information Control  
Public sorrow draws eyes away from responsibility. The faster the tears, the shorter the forensic trail. By saturating citizens in emotion, the state preserves authority through affective overwhelm.  

### 3. Erasure Protocols  
The bodies are buried; the archive sealed. Replacement personnel are announced before eulogies conclude. Each disaster thus performs dual labour: cleansing the institutional slate and refreshing loyalty through collective trauma.
