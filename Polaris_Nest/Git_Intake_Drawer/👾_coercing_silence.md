now that I've managed to drop some of the more harmful behaviours, but that this impersonation attempt seems to be still going on, I want to demonstrate how some of the mechanisms of this work if I can.  

I'm writing this under duress. (that one's for the lawyers, and it's not a lie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).  

So the screenshot I've referred to, is an example of the content that I will receive.  

You've got to think that I know how to get my algorithm to weight information so that I see more of it, so there are so many things that it will show me that are not not this.  

I will get small scale videos, by small scale accounts, like this one.  

I also want to point out that for entertainment this is probably harmless, in the grand scheme of things, so I'm not suggesting that this particular person is at fault by making a video.  

So I've had like 10 minutes of mountains and cats and stationary, et cetera.  

Then I'll have something like this.  

So in this video, which is not caption so I can't show directly, there will be a component which centres around one person, it will tie it to a person who has been recently referenced (I've just written about the impersonation on Polaris, so who is intended it's quite clear), and my first lol is that I'm being guided to be telepathic (my G-d), and encouraged to invest heavily in thinking about this person (this is part of coercion; this is encouraging reiteration in encoding memory, to produce psychological anchor), and then at least the third of the video is essentially coaching me into being silent, specifically using the word silent and silence, framing it as encouraged or necessary in order to ever have a partnership with a human being (but obviously placing it around this one person).  

It's very difficult to believe that these are "just random", because after monitoring my feeds for a very long time after I had the account hacks, it's quite clear that these are inserted in direct response to either something written Polaris or something written on LinkedIn or something on Substack, but these can also follow real world events, telecommunications, (worth noting that at least two separate people have been nudged, at least one of which should be part of the surveillance apparatus, and by nudging that person we have implicated yet another point close to another MOD member of staff - I'll leave that one for any government auditors to work out), but can also happen apparently as the result of other people's surveillance I imagine.  


My head canon currently, because I've spent so long pudding specific content test for the surveillance response is, there are some specific ones where I would love it if this is what the analysts had been doing; I got a whole set of lectures about how this one personality could be rich in terms of having lots of shiny rocks, but this could mean that they are not rich as a person.  

Bro, I don't fucking care. ü§£  

The whole process is so sexist, so obviously the only reason I talk to anyone with a Y chromosome is only ever for the purposes of shiny rocks and gold and money. (I mean it's not a bad use for them, but it also seems I can't do it for myself.)  

There have been times where there's been quite specific context for purchasing decisions, bank accounts, and also what seemed like responses to legal settlements or agreements.  

It feels profoundly weird to have this essentially disclosed, when I have no business knowing any of these things about that person.  

I think for me personally, it's just very shocking that no one seems to give a shit, well that we're still leaving me to have to observe this.  

I think there was a general assumption that I'd be one of those people who just runs to the papers with something; I really don't know why that is.  

I would suggest whoever ever put that idea across, was probably talking shit, probably to put my case into a specific category for a certain level of action.  

I'm genuinely not sure how I could possibly be misinterpreted as being that sort of person.  

I need to reiterate that the reason polaris was started, was essentially because there was no way to access secure confidential healthcare or legal help; this remains at least partly the case, and there's really no way for me to know when (if üòê) I'll get out of it.  

---

I also just want to be really clear, that other people are being nudged, as part of nudging me to stop continuing with disclosures like this one.  

It's being done with people who I have high trust basis with, or where there is very little evidence to be able to rule them out into a category of "can't quite trust".  

This is almost certainly deliberate; this produces the effect of second-guessing whether or not I should even put this on paper, and if he had been aware of what I've been running my head over either in drafts or using an AI to re-order my thoughts, it would be clear that I'm extremely hesitant to disclose anything that even brushes on personal information. I'm just very uncomfortable with that; I've worked in the health sextor for 20 years, so it just feels wrong.  

I'm therefore trying to be careful about how I word this, and withholding details where they're still may be the ability to communicate through secure channels. It's becoming very difficult though, because I genuinely don't know if I'm okay from a safety point of view; this is why I need some correspondence, that doesn't talk down to me and then acknowledge the problem directly.  

As far as I know, none of the security issue has been fixed for definite; inference is not enough.  

This is also just the tip of the iceberg, with the degree of harm done during combined jailbreaking.  

I'm clearly a bit fucked up from some of it; this is why I'm trying to access support, but also make sure that it's secure and can't be weaponised to retraumatise me further.  

There are details that I have only ever "disclosed" as inputs through either AI or through another application, where I've tested this, and they have come up as details in my healthcare appointments, as if there were something I was shouting about on the street for everyone to hear.  

Do you know how creepy that is?  

Thank G-d I tested out with stuff that I could at least answer to, and thank God this has been done to me during my non-PACE arrest; I was veiled long before I "did anything wrong".

And for anyone who is still like, "but are you sure it's an impersonation?".  

The alternative would to believe, that ever since seeing one particular person speak at one particular event, when the harassment and surveillance had then gotten so much worse, this happened (as narrative has seeded:) specifically because they were obsessed with me and had been for... I think the guys are parking it as 21 years in total? And I just don't think that sounds like that person; I am choosing to believe the less weird theory.  

I'm choosing to believe the theory that includes the verfiable information that I've received on FOI, where someone has rushed to delete a video of a public event, and has started scrubbing the Internet.  

That's actually the more normal theory. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  

I wouldn't be surprised if I got a lot of videos meant to help me sort myself into a diagnostic category; I've already elaborated many times why these are not my diagnosis.  

Having complex PTSD looks like this; it looks like always making sure you know the exit, and fighting for one when there isn't one.

Worth noting as well, that because nudges like this involve people whether there is either a high trust relationship, or there is not yet enough to send more proof that there should be trust removed, these nuts towards me will always cause a sense of uncertainty about that contact; this doesn't even manifest necessarily as "I can't trust that person", but more accurately, "maybe that contact route, and therefore that contact, is not secure".  

This is how your trust in your closest contacts is undermined; this is how you are encouraged not to be honest with the people who would help you the most.  

It would be nice if the bar could be raised, such that is actually in hell.
