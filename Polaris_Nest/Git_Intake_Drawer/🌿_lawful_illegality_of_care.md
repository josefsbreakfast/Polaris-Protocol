# 🌱 Guerrilla Gardening — The Lawful Illegality of Care  
**First created:** 2025-10-22  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*When tending the neglected becomes a legal question.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Examines the contested legality of guerrilla gardening in the UK — the act of planting on land you don’t own or formally lease.  
Explores how civic neglect, land banking, and austerity policies create the conditions for citizens to re-enter public space through unsanctioned care.  
Frames guerrilla gardening as both environmental action and **living insurgency** — slow, rooted resistance that turns neglect into renewal.  
Asks: who has the right to repair what’s been abandoned?

## ⚖️ 1. Legal Grey Zones  
- **Criminal Damage Act 1971:** technically covers “altering” property without consent, but planting rarely meets the damage threshold.  
- **Trespass:** a civil matter unless aggravated; most councils quietly ignore low-risk plantings.  
- **Local Authority Land:** some boroughs treat it as community engagement, others as fly-tipping.  
- **Highways Act 1980 / Town & Country Planning Act 1990:** verge planting can breach safety or planning rules.  

Result: a civic Schrödinger’s cat — **lawful illegality** where care and offence coexist.

## 🌳 2. Living Insurgency — Photosynthetic Resistance  
The rebellion grows quietly.  
It doesn’t break glass; it roots through it.  
Each seed is a signature against abandonment, each bloom an unauthorised planning permission.  
Guerrilla gardeners practice a **temporal politics** — patience as protest.  
Their labour rewrites land tenure in chlorophyll: whoever tends, owns, if only for a season.  

> 🪶 **Principle — Care as Insurgency**  
> To nurture the neglected is to disobey the indifference that created neglect.  
> Growth becomes the medium of dissent.

## 🧩 3. Institutional Responses  
- Councils launch “adopt-a-plot” schemes to legalise what was already working.  
- Universities and corporate estates rebrand it as “eco-volunteering.”  
- Police classify it as “low-harm antisocial behaviour.”  

Each move metabolises rebellion into compliance — care domesticated by consent forms.  
The state, allergic to unlicensed hope, files it under *community engagement.*

## 🌼 4. Ethics of Cultivation  
Guerrilla gardening exposes the rift between legality and legitimacy.  
Tending a neglected patch becomes an act of **moral maintenance**, not property violation.  
The soil recognises generosity differently than the law does.

---

## 🪴 5. Future Law of Commons Care  
Proposes statutory recognition of *non-proprietary stewardship* — rights to maintain, not to own.  
Outlines a civic category: **Custodial Commons**, where care itself becomes the title deed.  
The next reform of planning law could measure responsibility not by deeds but by persistence.

*🌱 Guerrilla Gardening — The Lawful Illegality of Care* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the contradictions between law, neglect, and moral repair in the stewardship of public land.
