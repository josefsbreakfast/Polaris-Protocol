# ⚖️ Phantom Claim as Double Blade  

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*How a phantom hereditary claim discredited two parties at once: the subject and a secondary target.*  

---

## Summary  
- The phantom claim was constructed to **suppress one party** and **delegitimise another**.  
- Old-fashioned tactic: one spoofed or staged disclosure undermines multiple actors simultaneously.  

---

## Pattern  
- Not the work of a single architect, but of a **grift economy** where suppression is a commodity.  
- A “fixer industry” that creates disinformation artefacts for institutional convenience.

*Phantom Claim as Double Blade* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how phantom narratives function as multi-target discrediting tools within a suppression economy.
