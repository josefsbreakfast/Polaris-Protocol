*Teaching children to navigate the web safely, curiously, and critically.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node sketches humane, developmentally appropriate ways to help children learn how the internet actually works — not just what to fear.  
It balances **agency, safety, and literacy**, showing that healthy digital habits come from guided exploration, not total restriction.

---

## 🧩 Key Practices  
- **Sandbox First:** create small, closed networks (school-based servers or cooperative sandboxes) where children can publish, comment, and moderate together.  
- **Identity as Costume:** teach pseudonyms and avatars as a *skill*, not deception.  
- **Digital Empathy Drills:** role-play moderation decisions, “what happens when words spread.”  
- **Source Sleuthing:** practice tracing an image or quote back to origin — detective games over punishment.  
- **Co-drafted Rules:** classrooms write their own community guidelines; compare with platform ToS.  
- **Exit Literacy:** knowing when to log off is a skill; teach pacing and body awareness.
