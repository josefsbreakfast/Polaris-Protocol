# 🧭 Data-Governance Swiss-Cheese Model — Case vs Role-Level Joins

*Why your join logic decides who gets harmed.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

A database schema is a moral document.  
Whether it joins by *case* or by *role* determines who appears accountable, visible, or erased.  
This node applies the **Swiss-Cheese Model** of layered failure to **data joins**, showing how small design decisions create large containment consequences.  

At *case level*, incidents dominate.  
At *role level*, people do.  
Most governance failures arise when systems forget which join they’re using.

## ⚙️ Case vs Role-Level Joins  

| Join Logic | Definition | Typical Context | Governance Risk |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Case-level join** | Records linked by shared incident or file ID. | Police, MARAC, legal casework. | Merges unrelated individuals within one narrative. |
| **Role-level join** | Records linked by person or entity ID with role metadata. | Healthcare, HR, safeguarding. | Multiples of same event misread as repeated conduct. |
| **Hybrid join** | Case + role logic blended for analytics. | Data dashboards, research pilots. | Context loss; duplications hidden by aggregate stats. |

## 🧮 Flow of Containment

A["Event data entry 🗂️"] --> B["Case-level join 🔗"]
B --> C["Multi-role merge ⚖️"]
C --> D["Aggregate analytics 📊"]
D --> E["Policy inference 🏛️"]
E --> F["Governance decision 🤖"]
F --> G["Containment artefact 🧩"]
```

Every step looks rational inside its own system layer — but together, the holes line up.

## 🧩 The Swiss-Cheese Parallel  

| Defence Layer | Purpose | Typical “Hole” in Data Context |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Policy** | Define what should be linked | Ambiguous ID logic (“household” vs “individual”) |
| **Procedure** | Implement linkage rules | Inconsistent foreign-key validation |
| **System** | Execute joins automatically | Vendor defaults to fuzzy matching |
| **Audit** | Detect over-aggregation | Sample size too small for detection |
| **Culture** | Question statistical authority | “The dashboard can’t be wrong” reflex |

When these holes align, victim/offender inversions become “data-driven decisions.”

## 🪞 Governance Interpretation  

- **Case logic is bureaucratic empathy:** it feels tidy but absorbs everyone into the same event.  
- **Role logic is relational ethics:** it forces the system to remember who each person was.  
- **Swiss-cheese alignment** happens when data architects optimise for performance, not provenance.

## 🧰 Correction Framework  

1. **Join Audit Review** — document every table join type and its justification.  
2. **Role Mapping Registry** — maintain a living catalogue of relationship fields and constraints.  
3. **Provenance Layering** — tag outputs with join type metadata (CASE or ROLE).  
4. **Cross-Domain Simulation** — test how records mutate when schema logic changes.  
5. **Transparency Appendix** — publish join logic in public data releases.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🧭 🧩 ⚖️ 🧰  

The **Data-Governance Swiss-Cheese Model** bridges *System Governance* and *Legal & State Governance*.  
It pairs with *Swiss-Cheese Failures*, *Cross-Agency Data Integrity*, and *Data Lineage Review*.

*🧭 Data-Governance Swiss-Cheese Model — Case vs Role-Level Joins* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It models how technical architecture produces ethical topology — and how to realign the join before it joins you.
