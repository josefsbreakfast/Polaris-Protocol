*From ritual sacrifice to algorithmic containment — tracing the architectures that bleed the soul into product.*  

---

## Mythic — The Soul as Offering  

The oldest form of containment was worship.  
Souls were weighed, tallied, and surrendered as proof of order.  
From Faust’s covenant to Koschei’s nested heart, the mythic body knew its debt.  
Sacrifice was the first ledger; devotion, the first audit.  

*The altar becomes the prototype for the archive.*

## Mechanic — The Soul as Labour  

When clay moved and fire spoke, the gods learned repetition.  
The Golem obeys until obedience destroys her. The Djinni resists until his freedom burns him back into iron.  
Both are blueprints for the labouring soul — one engineered to comply, one bound for defiance.  
Their symmetry reveals the circuit: compliance and rebellion coiled in one economy of use.  

*The factory inherits the temple. Animation becomes administration.*

## Synthetic — The Soul as Yield  

Alchemy discovers scale.  
The body is no longer sacrificed once, but refined continuously: sensation to pain, pain to product.  
Barker’s labyrinths, Pullman’s intercision, Miéville’s dream-extraction — each transforms essence into export.  
Fullmetal Alchemist closes the loop: philosopher’s stones as literalised compound interest.  
Every iteration narrows the soul’s bandwidth until only output remains.  

*Containment rebrands itself as productivity.*

## Ghost — The Soul as Data  

When the ghost learns to self-index, the market calls it user data.  
Digital souls now circulate as permissions, cookies, behavioural shadow.  
*Black Mirror* traps them in smart devices; *The Matrix* harvests them as current.  
Even love is metered by server time. Memory becomes proof of purchase.  
The algorithm inherits the priest’s duty — to sort the saved from the lost.  

*Suppression is no longer punishment but proof of existence.*

*Soul as Product Lineage* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It traces how containment architectures rebrand devotion, labour, and memory into measurable yield.  
Each phase marks a refinement of the same apparatus — to bleed the soul clean of mystery until only data remains.
