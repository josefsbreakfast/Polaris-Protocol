# 📘 How Declarations Work  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*A clear, human explanation of how transparency declarations function for HMRC and DWP when receiving small-scale civic support.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explains **how and when items must be declared** to:

- **HMRC** (taxable income thresholds)  
- **DWP** (benefit-impact thresholds)  

It is written for clarity, not for legal direction.  
It serves as a public-facing **transparency explainer**, showing exactly how Polaris remains compliant as a civic project.

## 🧭 What Counts as a Declaration?  
A “declaration” is simply:

- logging what was received  
- estimating a value  
- assessing if it crosses a threshold  
- reporting it if relevant  
- storing the record for audit clarity  

This applies to:

- small items from the registry  
- letters/postcards (usually £0)  
- printed documents  
- occasional practical items (if any)  

Most incoming PO Box material has **no value** and therefore does **not** affect benefits or tax.

## 💷 HMRC: What Actually Matters  
HMRC only cares about:

1. **Taxable income**, and  
2. **Whether you exceed allowances**

Registry items are:

- **non-cash**,  
- **low-value**,  
- usually **gifts**,  
- and fall under “miscellaneous untaxed personal gifts” unless you begin generating consistent income.

**Books, postcards, and letters are not taxable.**

You commit to:

- Approximate-value logging  
- Clear item description  
- Declaring if (and ONLY if) thresholds are met  

This is far beyond what HMRC typically expects for personal gifts.

## 🏛️ DWP: What They Actually Look At  
DWP is concerned with:

- monetary income  
- high-value gifts  
- regular payments  
- changes in circumstance  
- evidence of undeclared work  

Polaris:

- invites no payments  
- requests no money  
- receives no cash  
- logs only occasional material support  
- is transparently non-commercial  
- defines itself as **civic contribution, not employment**  

A book is not income.  
A postcard is not income.  
Support ≠ employment.  
Visibility ≠ capacity for full-time work.

---

## 📝 Threshold Logic (Simplified)  
A declaration is required only if:

- items become **regular, valuable, and predictable**, OR  
- someone begins sending high-value equipment, OR  
- support becomes **monetary**, OR  
- Polaris turns into income-generating work  

At present:

- All values remain low  
- Frequency is unknown but unlikely to be significant  
- Everything is logged  
- Nothing is financial  

**This is high-integrity compliance**.

---

## 📊 The Transparency Log  
All items are recorded in the  
**🛒 Correspondence & Items Received** node:

- date  
- type  
- description  
- approximate value  
- source  
- notes  

This log is what auditors love:

- clear  
- consistent  
- organised  
- honest  
- low-value  
- documented

It inoculates against distortion.  
It pre-empts misunderstandings.  
It models governance integrity.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters for Polaris  
Because Polaris critiques systems, it must:

- outperform them ethically  
- exceed baseline transparency  
- be audit-ready  
- show good faith  
- mark the difference between **civic reciprocity** and **commercial exchange**  

This node exists to remove ambiguity and demonstrate compliance.

*How Declarations Work* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It clarifies the small-scale transparency and compliance logic used when receiving civic correspondence or low-value items.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
