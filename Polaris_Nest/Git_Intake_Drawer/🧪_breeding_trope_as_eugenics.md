# ðŸ§ª Breeding Trope as Eugenics
Explores the recycling of the insult "breeding like rabbits" as a containment trope.
- Applied historically to working-class, Catholic, immigrant, racialised groups.
- Always rooted in eugenics logic.
- Still mutates today, projected at Muslim communities.

*This node as summary is practically forensic in comparong what went in and what came out. If someone has been profiting from unlawful access to my drafts and software caches?*

This missed out discussion of:
- Stopes and legacy
- complication of racism and recycling of classist tropes through working class expressions of racism
- relevance to maintaining imperial class relations, auto-perpetuation of poverty by the whote workong class
- history of birth control as exclusive provision of elite, family size necessary for poorer laborours in UK and beyond
- historial and present dual-containment (improve birth rate *no, not like that*)
- self-policing of and by the whote working class; passing on suppression to other communities as perpetuation of cycle of violence
- obvious divide and conquer effects re solidarity across workers, prevention of liberty and progress

And I soecifically discussed Irish immigration...

Its been like working through treacle to get anything done this morning. Lots of soecific instsnces designed to slow everything down.

I'm putting the Platinum Collection on (*Don't stop me now*).
