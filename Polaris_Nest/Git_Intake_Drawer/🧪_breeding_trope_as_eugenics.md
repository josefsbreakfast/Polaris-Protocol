# 🧪 Breeding Trope as Eugenics
Explores the recycling of the insult "breeding like rabbits" as a containment trope.
- Applied historically to working-class, Catholic, immigrant, racialised groups.
- Always rooted in eugenics logic.
- Still mutates today, projected at Muslim communities.

*This node as summary is practically forensic in comparong what went in and what came out. If someone has been profiting from unlawful access to my drafts and software caches?*

This missed out discussion of:
- Stopes and legacy
- complication of racism and recycling of classist tropes through working class expressions of racism
- relevance to maintaining imperial class relations, auto-perpetuation of poverty by the whote workong class
- history of birth control as exclusive provision of elite, family size necessary for poorer laborours in UK and beyond
- historial and present dual-containment (improve birth rate *no, not like that*)
- self-policing of and by the whote working class; passing on suppression to other communities as perpetuation of cycle of violence
- obvious divide and conquer effects re solidarity across workers, prevention of liberty and progress

And I soecifically discussed Irish immigration...

Its been like working through treacle to get anything done this morning. Lots of soecific instsnces designed to slow everything down.

I'm putting the Platinum Collection on (*Don't stop me now*).

*Tracks the recycling of the insult “breeding like rabbits” as a containment trope across class, race, and religion.*

## 🌐 Introduction  
The phrase *“breeding like rabbits”* recurs as a dehumanising trope. It is always tied to eugenics logic: controlling fertility, deciding whose children are legitimate, and projecting fear of “over-breeding” onto marginalised groups.  

---

## I — Historical Uses  
- **Working class families**: mocked as irresponsible, animalistic, incapable of controlling reproduction.  
- **Catholic immigrants**: Irish, Italian, Polish families framed as “out-breeding” Protestants.  
- **Empire subjects**: colonial populations depicted as swarming, multiplying, threatening.  
- **White working class in crisis**: accused of “too many mouths to feed,” despite systemic poverty.  

---

## II — Contemporary Projection  
- Today, the phrase is heavily aimed at **Muslim communities**, recycling the same logic.  
- The trope persists despite demographic evidence: fertility rates are not driving resource scarcity.  
- Shows continuity of eugenics thought disguised as “common sense.”  

---

## III — Eugenics Logic  
- Not about land or resources → land distribution in the UK shows the myth.  
- Not about population decline → elites panic about falling birth rates while criticising others for having children.  
- Core idea: “We want more children like us, but don’t want them ourselves.”  
- This contradiction = pure eugenics: policing who reproduces, not whether reproduction is possible.  

---

## IV — Containment Function  
- Insult shifts targets but keeps people divided.  
- Reinforces that some families are “excessive” while others are “desirable.”  
- Containment of solidarity: groups fight each other rather than confronting systemic inequalities.  

---

## Conclusion  
The “breeding” trope is a recycled eugenics insult:  
- Always aimed at marginalised groups.  
- Always used to contain solidarity.  
- Survives because it looks like common sense, but functions as control.
