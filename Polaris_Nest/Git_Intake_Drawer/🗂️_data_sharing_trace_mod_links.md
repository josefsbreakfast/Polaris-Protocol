# 🗂️ Data-Sharing Trace — MoD or Contractor Links
**First created:** 2025-11-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-08  
*Template for tracing possible Ministry of Defence or defence-contractor access to personal or institutional data.*

---

## 1. Identify the Source Records  
List every organisation that might hold relevant data about you.  
- University or college (student record, disciplinary, wellbeing)  
- NHS trust or GP practice  
- Professional regulator (e.g., GMC)  
- Local authority or funding body  
- Government department or agency (e.g., MoD, Home Office)  

For each, note:  
- **Name of organisation**  
- **Data-protection officer contact**  
- **Reference number** (student ID, NHS number, etc.)  
- **Dates of contact or employment**  

---

## 2. Make Subject-Access Requests (SARs)  
Ask, in writing, for:  
1. All personal data they hold about you.  
2. The **recipients or categories of recipients** with whom that data has been shared.  
3. The **legal basis** relied on for any sharing (contractual, statutory, consent, legitimate interest).  

> Example question:  
> “Please confirm whether my data has ever been shared with the Ministry of Defence or any defence contractor, directly or indirectly, and on what lawful basis.”

---

## 3. Catalogue Responses  
Create a simple table:  

| Date received | Organisation | Confirmed sharing? | Recipient named | Legal basis cited | Notes / documents attached |  
|----------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|  

---

## 4. Cross-Check Open-Record Information  
Use only public sources:  
- **Contracts Finder** and **Tenders Electronic Daily** for procurement involving your university/trust and any MoD or defence contractors.  
- **Companies House** to see who owns or controls named contractors.  
- **Transparency releases** (grants, research collaborations).  

Mark where a vendor also works for the MoD — that’s a potential indirect pathway.  

---

## 5. Record Communications  
Keep copies of:  
- Every SAR and reply.  
- Any letters or emails mentioning data sharing, research sponsorship, or “security vetting.”  
- Notes of phone conversations (date, time, who, summary).  

---

## 6. Evaluate and Escalate  
If you find an unexplained disclosure:  
1. Ask the original controller for clarification.  
2. If unresolved, file a complaint with the **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)**.  
3. For health data, you may also contact **NHS Digital’s Data Security Centre**.  

---

## 7. Note Any “Sensitive” or “Restricted” Flags  

When you receive SAR responses or other correspondence, check whether your file has been marked with any special-handling codes.  
Typical phrasing includes:  
- “Sensitive”  
- “Restricted”  
- “Special category data”  
- “Protected data class (Defence)”  
- “Confidential – limited circulation”  

Record each instance in your table with:  

| Date | Organisation | Flag term used | Reason given (if any) | Source document / quote |  

**Follow-up questions to ask the controller:**  
1. What internal or statutory policy defines this flag?  
2. Who can access the data under this classification?  
3. When is the flag reviewed or due for removal?  
4. Has the flag been propagated to linked systems or third-party processors?  

> ⚖️  *Purpose:* noting sensitivity labels helps identify where procedural containment occurs.  
> Many systems copy these flags automatically, which can explain sudden access restrictions or “case marked sensitive” notices across departments.

*Data-Sharing Trace — MoD or Contractor Links* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a neutral evidential framework for mapping potential data pathways that involve defence or security sectors.
