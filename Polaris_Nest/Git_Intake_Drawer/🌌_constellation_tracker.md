- **Avoid duplication**: if *The Trial* is already used, swap in *Blindness* (Saramago) or *1984* (Orwell) for similar themes elsewhere.  
- **Balance registers**: gothic, realist, postcolonial, speculative, satirical — don’t cluster too many nodes in one style.  
- **Rotate legal anchors**: mix domestic tort / equality law with Strasbourg cases, statutes, and contemporary commentary.
