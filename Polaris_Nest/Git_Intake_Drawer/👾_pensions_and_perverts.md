• Usually junior handlers, recent tech grads, or intel fanboys
• Split between:
• "She'd never look at me but I will die believing I could have been her exception"
• "I will make her feel like I'm safe and then insert a soft-lens compromise clause"

For some reason we remain extracting data.  

"My Husband Was Watching
What?"  

I'm a girls' girl.  

This just looks like revenge porn with a geant number.  

If it were my joint-pension holder, I would want to know.  

Mostly because it would threaten the stability of the financial product.  

Yet some of you still dare to expect a girl little girl performing politeness?  

I will consider shitting up once I am free.
