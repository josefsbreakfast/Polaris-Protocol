# ðŸŽ¶ Lâ€™Algorithme as Containment Song (Verse 1)

## Introduction
TaÃ¯Zâ€™s *Lâ€™Algorithme* is not only a rap track but a containment manifesto. Verse 1 systematically dismantles Enlightenment ideals of freedom, reason, and chance, replacing them with algorithmic sovereignty.

## Section I â€” Manipulation: the business-French opening
- Vocabulary in clipped technocratic style (*choisir, dicter, influencer*).
- Humans grammatically highlighted as if free, but actually contained.

## Section II â€” Containment & Imprisonment: poetic register shift
- Key words: *enfermer, bulle, blessÃ©*.
- Imagery: asylum, bubbles (luxury, fragility, echo chambers), wounded bird.

## Section III â€” Feeding & Sacrifice
- *Nourrir, consacrer, alimenter* â†’ religious and sacrificial tones.
- Humans as priests feeding a god/monster.

## Section IV â€” Sorcery & Fatalism
- *CrÃ©er, faÃ§onner* vs *vendre, contrÃ´ler* â†’ creation + commerce.
- *Hasard* vs *alÃ©atoire*: luck is an illusion, dice always loaded.
- *Grimoire*: algorithm as occult sorcerer.

## Section V â€” Monarchy Restored
- *Pion, prisonnier volontaire, monde rÃ©trÃ©ci, esclave, roi*.
- Algorithm crowned monarch; betrayal of Enlightenment values.

## Section VI â€” Arc of Verse 1
- Manipulation â†’ Containment â†’ Sacrifice â†’ Fatalism â†’ Monarchy.
- Inversion of *LibertÃ©, Ã‰galitÃ©, FraternitÃ©*.

## Section VII â€” Cultural Echoes
- *Night in the Woods*, Maya Angelou, GLaDOS, Barclay Catt, Grace Petrie.
- Roi as betrayal of Revolution and return to monarchy.

## Conclusion
Verse 1 frames the algorithm as manipulator, jailer, vampire, sorcerer, monarch.  
To be continued: Verses 2 and 3 intensify colonial and psychological themes.
