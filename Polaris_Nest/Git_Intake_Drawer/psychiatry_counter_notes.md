# Counter-Notes to Psychiatric Letter

These notes document misrepresentations, framing biases, and selective omissions in the psychiatric letter, contrasted with the patient's actual statements and context.

### On "systematic delusions"

The label "systematic delusions" is misplaced.  
- My belief that data is fragmented across multiple institutions is **true**, confirmed by FOI/SAR responses.  
- I explicitly explained in clinic that multiple requests were necessary because oversight is spread across agencies.  
- Interpreting lawful SAR/FOI activity as "delusional" collapses a **legal right** into a **psychiatric symptom**.  

This framing serves institutional defensiveness, not clinical accuracy.

### On "conspiracy" framing

The psychiatrist repeatedly asked whether I thought events were part of a "conspiracy."  
- I explicitly resisted that framing: I stated I would *not* use the word, citing my awareness of my father’s psychosis.  
- I also offered alternative explanations (e.g. administrative errors, lost requests).  

In the letter, only my cautious reference is quoted, stripped of context.  
This misrepresents my position and demonstrates selective documentation.  
The term "conspiracy" was introduced by the clinician, not by me.

### On Cabinet responses and hidden investigation

Cabinet responses suggest an internal inquiry is already underway.  
- Departments acknowledge something is being traced but avoid naming which part of government is responsible.  
- There is reluctance to commit anything to writing, despite unusual details (e.g. new number issued by EE, repeated requests for a criminal reference number).  
- This pattern is consistent with investigation *without acknowledgement*: agencies quietly pulling threads before anyone accepts formal responsibility.

### Timeline Marker: EE number and Cabinet responses

- Shortly after [insert date or approximate month/year], EE issued me a new phone number.  
- Around the same period, I was repeatedly asked to provide a criminal reference number before progress could be made.  
- Cabinet’s response pattern (“still trying to find which parts of government…”) coincides with this timing.  

This cluster of events suggests linkage: the EE number change and reference number requests may form part of the internal inquiry Cabinet is reluctant to acknowledge.

### On timing of psychiatric letter vs. escalation

- The psychiatric appointment and subsequent letter occurred immediately before the matter escalated to the point of Royal Household awareness.  
- This timing suggests the letter was positioned as insulation: a pre-emptive record framing me as "delusional" to deflect scrutiny.  
- Referral to Early Psychosis served as a delaying tactic, allowing institutions to say the issue was being "handled."  
- Once the Royal Household became involved, such framing was insufficient: procedural integrity and audit trails are now unavoidable.

### On impersonation claims and institutional shift

- I have consistently stated that incidents attributed to me and another individual involve **impersonation / proxy harassment**, not genuine interaction.  
- My language has included recognising racist caricature-style mimicry, reinforcing that this was not how the individual would present himself.  
- With Cabinet, Lords clerks, the Royal Household, MoD, HJS, and others now exposed to the same contested narrative, a **data audit** becomes the only sustainable resolution.  
- Recent frankness from MoD, HJS, etc. ("we’ll check our records / remove your history") suggests protective distancing: institutions anticipate audit and are positioning themselves accordingly.
