# 🕸️ Containment as Emergent System Behaviour

*How coupled optimisation systems learn to slow, silence, or sideline without instruction.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Containment doesn’t require conspiracy.  
When multiple risk-management algorithms share data, each one adds its own margin of caution.  
Together they form a feedback loop that behaves like intentional suppression.

---

## 🔁 Mechanism  

1. **Uncertainty → safety rule:**  
   “If not sure, reduce exposure.”  

2. **Propagation across systems:**  
   One platform’s “low confidence” flag becomes another’s “low trustworthiness” score.  

3. **Cascading de-prioritisation:**  
   Visibility drops, transactions delay, opportunities evaporate.  

4. **Human perception:**  
   Feels like reputational fog or invisible bureaucracy.  
   No one actor knows they’re part of the loop.

---

## 🧰 Mitigation  

- **Isolation:** prevent risk scores from auto-propagating.  
- **Transparency:** log and display uncertainty explicitly.  
- **Human audit interrupts:** require justification for suppression cascades.  
- **Feedback channels:** allow individuals to query and correct propagated flags.

## 🌌 Constellations  
🕸️ 🧩 ⚙️ 🌊 — the containment cluster: friction, feedback, and the limits of automation.

## 🏮 Footer  
Containment emerges when machines mistake uncertainty for danger.  
It can only be undone by re-introducing dialogue.
