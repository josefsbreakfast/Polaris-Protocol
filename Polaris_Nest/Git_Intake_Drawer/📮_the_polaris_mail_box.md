*An analogue doorway for solidarity, curiosity, and careful communication.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
This is the **official Polaris mail box**.  
It exists so that those who prefer pens to platforms can send postcards, notes, or small letters.  
Please keep it civil, creative, and within the law.  
We are here for correspondence — not contraband.

## ✉️ Address Format  
Use the format below when writing:

## 📜 House Rules — or, How Not to Get Anyone in Trouble  

1. **Postcards and letters only.**  
   Flat paper, no parcels, no boxes, no “surprises.”  

2. **No money, vouchers, or gift cards.**  
   The UK *Proceeds of Crime Act* makes cash-by-post a regulatory nightmare.  
   Please spare us the paperwork.  

3. **No perishable, biological, or electronic items.**  
   That includes food, USB drives, batteries, powders, liquids, and anything that beeps.  

4. **No personal data dumps.**  
   Do not send confidential records, identifiers, or legal evidence through the postal system.  
   Use digital disclosure routes for that.  

5. **Keep it legal and kind.**  
   Nothing threatening, defamatory, or unlawful.  
   Humour and satire are fine; harassment is not.  

6. **Mail may be archived.**  
   Non-personal correspondence may be quoted or scanned for research and recordkeeping.  
   By writing, you grant permission for non-commercial archival use.  

7. **Anonymity is allowed, not weaponised.**  
   You may sign or not sign — but don’t use anonymity to harm, stalk, or impersonate.

## 🚫 If You Ignore the Rules  
- **Minor breaches** (e.g. confetti explosions, sticky substances) → mail destroyed and not acknowledged.  
- **Serious or illegal content** → reported to Royal Mail Security or police under the *Postal Services Act 2000*.  
- **Threats or harassment** → retained as evidence and may be shared with legal counsel.  
- **Persistent offenders** → blocked via postal filters and publicly blacklisted in repository metadata (with humour).  

The guiding principle: **don’t make me fill out forms.**

## 🧾 Safety Note (UK Postal Law Basics)  
Royal Mail may inspect or withhold items that violate the *Postal Services Act 2000* or other regulations.  
Suspicious mail is reportable to Royal Mail Security (0345 600 0606) or local police (101).  
Keep your return address optional, but legible if you’d like a reply.

## 🌱 Ethos  
The mail box exists as a slow, human counterweight to digital noise.  
Postcards remind us that attention is a gift.  
Good manners are the only required postage.
