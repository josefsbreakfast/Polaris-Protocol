**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-16  
*From SCL to Cambridge Analytica to Emerdata — and the persistence of data-driven political manipulation*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Cambridge Analytica’s collapse in 2018 did not end its methods.  
- Its people, tactics, and donor networks dispersed into new firms and think-tank ecosystems.  
- The same logic underpins today’s algorithmic culture wars.  

---

## Lineage  

### SCL Group → Cambridge Analytica (2013–2018)  
- Psychographic profiling via Facebook data.  
- Backed by Robert Mercer; Steve Bannon on the board.  

### Emerdata Ltd (2017– )  
- Successor company.  
- Directors included Rebekah & Jennifer Mercer, Alexander Nix, Julian Wheatland.  
- Quietly absorbed IP and staff.  

### Successor Firms & Practices  
- Alumni now run boutique “behavioural” consultancies.  
- Tactics used in Brexit, US 2016, then repurposed for domestic campaigns and lobbying.  

---

## Why It Matters  
- Migrant “crisis” headlines are not just organic — they are **micro-targeted narratives**, amplified online by firms using CA’s toolkit.  
- Data-driven behavioural nudges weaponise the donor-media agenda.  
- The “dark ads” machinery survives, just under new names.
