# 📋 Rectification Notice — Multi-Agency  
**First created:** 2025-11-12  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*Template notice for cross-agency correction of mis-applied security or OSA-style metadata.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
When a mistaken protective-marking has propagated into **health, justice, or partner-system datasets**, this letter ensures all controllers correct their copies in sync.  
It invokes **UK GDPR Articles 16–19** (rectification & notification) and **DPA 2018 Part 3 s.46–48**, compelling each recipient to confirm the clean-up chain.

## ✨ Template Letter  

> **Subject:** Rectification Notice — Removal of Incorrect OSA / Restricted Marking  
>
> Dear [Name / Team],  
>
> I am writing under **Articles 16 and 19 UK GDPR** to request rectification of inaccurate personal-data handling caused by the unauthorised application of an “OSA” / “Restricted” classification to records identifying me.  
>
> This marking has been confirmed as **administrative error** by [originating body], yet appears to persist within your systems.  Please:  
>
> 1. Identify all datasets where the marking or its derivatives remain;  
> 2. Remove or downgrade the label to *OFFICIAL*;  
> 3. Propagate correction notices to any onward processors or data-sharing partners; and  
> 4. Confirm completion in writing within one month.  
>
> For clarity, no ministerial certificate exists under the Official Secrets Act, and the originating organisation is not a Defence body.  Continued use of the flag may therefore constitute inaccurate processing under **Article 5(1)(d)** (accuracy).  
>
> Please treat this as a **multi-agency rectification request** and copy confirmations to the primary Data Protection Officer of [originating council / trust].  
>
> Sincerely,  
> [Your Name]  
> [Contact details / Reference numbers]

*📋 Rectification Notice — Multi-Agency* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how to force synchronised data-correction across inter-agency systems once a mis-applied security flag has been identified.
