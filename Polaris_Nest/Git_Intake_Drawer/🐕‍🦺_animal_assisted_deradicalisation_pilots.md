# 🐕‍🦺 Animal-Assisted Deradicalisation Pilots  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*Operant-conditioned companion animals as non-verbal stabilisers in early-stage deradicalisation, post-conflict reintegration, and VE-risk intervention.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node documents a quiet, rarely-acknowledged seam in violent-extremism rehabilitation: the use of **animal-assisted interventions (AAI)** — usually involving **operant-conditioned companion animals** — to enable stabilisation, co-regulation, and therapeutic access in individuals at risk of radicalisation or recovering from extremist involvement.

The practice is not typically framed as “counter-terrorism” in the UK; instead, it appears in trauma-driven deradicalisation work, CAAFAG reintegration pilots, youth VE early-intervention design, and experimental psychiatric modalities.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Animal-assisted therapy in derad pilots  
- Youth VE evidence base includes AAT  
- Operant conditioning as hidden backbone  
- Non-verbal stabilisation pathways  
- Hybrid governance footprint  
- UK feasibility mapping  

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  
### 1. Real-world use  
Jiyan Foundation / DeRaRe pilot with children formerly associated with ISIS uses animal-assisted treatment.

### 2. Youth VE evidence  
NSW Government / UQ evidence review lists AAT among modalities relevant to VE risk.

### 3. Why animals?  
Operant conditioning supports predictable comfort behaviours enabling trauma stabilisation and reducing narrative resistance.

### 4. Governance  
Fits experimental governance: clinically intensive, ethically complex, and pilot-scale only.

### 5. UK feasibility  
Only NHS tertiary trauma/forensic units, specialist trauma charities, or academic-clinical teams could run this. Never Prevent or CT bodies.
