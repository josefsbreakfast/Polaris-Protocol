# 🗣️ Counterframes Bank  

**First created:** 2025-11-02  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Concise reframings that restore factual language and emotional clarity when euphemisms spread.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

Propaganda wins by repetition; correction wins by rhythm.  
Counter-frames are short, truthful phrases that travel easily, expose euphemism, and return moral gravity to the record.  
Each entry pairs a distorted phrase with a concise, shareable correction.

## 💬 Active Counterframes  

| ID | Distorted Phrase | Counterframe | Usage Note |
|----|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| CF-01 | “population adjustment” | “forced displacement” | Use in replies, headlines, or captions; restore subject and agent. |
| CF-02 | “security recalibration” | “mass surveillance expansion” | Attach when announcements mask civil-rights erosion. |
| CF-03 | “energy realignment” | “fossil fuel subsidy extension” | Clarify continuity of extraction economics. |
| CF-04 | “community cleansing” | “ethnic targeting” | Name intent directly; never use quotation marks without correction. |
| CF-05 | “moral hygiene” | “censorship” | Expose virtue rhetoric as control mechanism. |

## ⚙️ Deployment Pattern  

1. **Short + True + Repeatable** — ≤ 7 words; preserve subject and verb.  
2. **Mirror first, then correct.** E.g. “What they call *population adjustment* is forced displacement.”  
3. **Archive the moment.** Attach screenshot + link + watchlist ID.  
4. **Amplify through coalition.** Share exact counter-phrasing across aligned accounts.  
5. **Update monthly.** Add new pairs to both this file and the CSV glossary.
