## 🧭 Orientation  

Every time a violent or unjust policy is re-named, something disappears: accountability.  
Euphemisms sound polite, but they work as noise-cancelling devices for harm.  
This note explains how to spot them and how to push back — without jargon, without losing humanity.

## 💬 Three Rules  

1. **If it hides the subject, ask why.**  
   > “Collateral damage” → *dead civilians*  
2. **If it replaces a verb with a noun, look for evasion.**  
   > “Population adjustment” → *people were removed by force*  
3. **If it sounds cleaner than what happened, restore the dirt.**  
   > “Enhanced interrogation” → *torture*

## 🧩 Why This Matters  

- Public policy is written in the same words people use to grieve or protest.  
- When language drifts, oversight drifts.  
- Re-naming harms can make entire communities invisible.  
- Naming things accurately is not aggression; it’s civic hygiene.

## ⚙️ What You Can Do  

✅ Use the literal term once for every euphemism you hear.  
✅ Link to your sources — it anchors reality.  
✅ Teach someone younger one example of “how they renamed X.”  
✅ Share counter-frames from the Polaris Bank.  
✅ Keep irony, keep compassion. Both survive censorship.
