# 🦇 How Many Words to Fell an Industry  
**First created:** 2025-11-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-04  
*On the grammar of collapse and the violence of phrasing.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Every industry falls twice: first in language, then in practice.  
When the first cracks appear, they are lexical — words escaping containment.  
This node studies how vocabulary functions as a kind of controlled demolition:  
a survivor language weaponised as record-keeping, then as revolt.  

It asks:  
- What does it mean to destabilise an industry *by writing about it correctly*?  
- How many words, or whose, does it take before a collapse becomes visible?  
- And why does institutional language always lag behind its own obituary?  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Linguistic Entropy:** collapse tracked via semantic decay in press, policy, or PR.  
- **Industry as Narrative:** how self-mythology holds systems upright until words rot through.  
- **Survivor Voice as Fault Line:** the tone that marks when truth ceases to be reputationally survivable.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The Quiet Breach  
Before the whistleblowers, there are adjectives: *sustainable*, *innovative*, *trusted*.  
They expand until they mean nothing, creating negative pressure where clarity should be.  
This lexical overinflation is the first tremor — the marketing version of a canary dying.  

### 2. The Survivor Sentence  
The survivor sentence is the one that can no longer be edited for tone.  
It carries fatigue and fury through syntax.  
It refuses the board-approved voice, even when disguised as professionalism.  
Industries fall when this sentence becomes common tongue.  

### 3. The Post-Collapse Grammar  
After collapse, industries develop new tenses —  
passive, haunted, always retrospective:  
> “Mistakes were made.”  
> “Processes are being reviewed.”  
This is bureaucracy’s version of grief: words that preserve the form of apology without admitting the act.  

### 4. Counter-Forensics  
Survivor writing recovers the original meaning by restoring risk to language.  
It counts the words that cost careers, maps who flinched first,  
and asks why truth must always speak in undertone before anyone listens.
