*When a classification system becomes a theology.*

## 🧭 Orientation
Melvil Dewey believed that order was a moral duty.
In 1876 he published the **Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC)** — an apparently neutral numbering system that, in practice, encoded the worldview of its creator.

## 🧩 Key Features
- **Moral architecture:** Christianity centralised at 200; all other faiths pushed to the 290s.
- **Gender & race bias:** male authorship and Western subjects normalised as default.
- **Eugenic adjacency:** “race improvement” once catalogued alongside medicine and sociology.
- **Politeness hierarchy:** “proper” language rewarded with accessibility; deviance archived at the margins.
