# 🏟️ Hackathon League  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Interdisciplinary hackathons as civic training grounds for digital cooperation.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node frames **cross-departmental hackathons** as the human equivalent of football leagues for digital resilience.  
The goal is not to “win” or “ship a product,” but to **train teams across silos** — government, academia, NGOs, and infrastructure engineers — to play the same game.

Each round builds **muscle memory in crisis cooperation**, so when real cyber or data emergencies hit, the players already know how to move together.

---

## 🧩 Key Principles  

- **Play Together Before the Match:** regular low-stakes interdisciplinary projects create trust and shared language.  
- **Rotating Captains:** leadership rotates per round (policy lead, data scientist, educator, survivor rep).  
- **Shared Pitch:** use anonymised, low-risk datasets to simulate real-world stressors.  
- **Scouting for Blind Spots:** every team fields an *outsider analyst* to surface assumptions and jargon drift.  
- **Post-Match Film Room:** after each event, teams review decisions like sports tape — where coordination lagged, who had visibility, what tools failed.

## 🧭 Sidebar: Federation Model  

| Level | Focus | Analogy |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Local Clubs** | Universities, councils, NGOs | Training academies |
| **Regional Leagues** | Sectoral mixes (e.g. health + cybersecurity) | National divisions |
| **Global Cup** | Treaty-level coordination events | World Cup of Resilience |

> Outcomes aren’t products — they’re **trained teams** and **documented plays** reusable across crises.
