## 🛰️ Orientation  
When Kipling writes 'If you can make one heap of all your winnings…' he’s describing crisis theatre: how to lose everything, start again, and never let it show.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Containment as Performance:** composure equals credibility.
- **Silence as Survival:** never breathe a word about your loss — avoid feeding the narrative loop.
- **Reconstruction as Identity:** rebuilding quietly creates authority through endurance.

## 🧿 Analysis  
This is the template for institutional recovery messaging. Modern PR and crisis-communications handbooks trace the same rhythm: acknowledge privately, reframe publicly, carry on visibly.

## 🌌 Constellations  
📜 🧠 ⚖️ — ethics, systems, emotional governance.  

## ✨ Stardust  
kipling, loss, reputation, containment, resilience
