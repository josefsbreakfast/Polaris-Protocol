*Records how evidence presented to the House of Lords Science & Technology Committee (2014 follow-up on Behaviour Change) raised sensible cautions, yet policy practice largely ignored them.*

## 🌐 Summary  
Between 2014–2016, the House of Lords Science & Technology Committee revisited the UK’s behavioural insights agenda. Witnesses from academia, civil society, and government departments raised measured cautions: nudges were over-sold, ethically opaque, and insufficient for major challenges. Despite these, government practice barely shifted. This node outlines the cautions, the reasons they were sidelined, and the systemic implications.

## 📍 Observed Cautions in Evidence  
- **Over-sold results:** small compliance uplifts were framed as transformative; academics warned long-term effects were unproven.  
- **Cheap fix temptation:** nudges politically attractive but risked substituting for regulation or investment.  
- **Equity risks:** vulnerable groups disproportionately affected, sometimes harmed.  
- **Transparency gap:** citizens often unaware of behavioural design shaping choices.  
- **Insufficient for structural issues:** obesity, smoking, and inequality require fiscal and regulatory levers.  
- **Democratic legitimacy:** covert nudging risks undermining trust.

Witnesses making these points included:  
- **Professor Theresa Marteau** (Cambridge, Behaviour & Health Research Unit).  
- **Professor David Metz** (UCL, transport).  
- **Professor Mike Kelly** (NICE).  
- Civil liberties groups (Liberty, Open Rights Group, via written submissions).  
- Lords committee members (Krebs, Selborne, Hilton, Patel) echoing limits.

## ❓ Why Evidence Was Ignored — Structural Dynamics  
1. **Political appetite for cheap fixes**  
   - Austerity made nudges attractive: low-cost, quick wins, no new taxes.  

2. **Enthusiasm bias**  
   - BIT was a world-first export and soft-power brand; acknowledging limits threatened the narrative.  

3. **Evaluation asymmetry**  
   - Nudges yielded easily measured uplifts; structural policies were slower and harder to evidence.  

4. **Weak institutional champions for critiques**  
   - Academics and NGOs lacked the same pull as HMRC, DWP, or Cabinet Office.  

5. **Procedural absorption**  
   - Committees “noted” the cautions but departments filed them as already considered, then carried on.  

6. **Timing and political climate**  
   - By 2015–2016, Brexit pressures dominated. Behavioural messaging seen as politically useful. Ethical cautions were backgrounded.

## 📈 Implications  
- **Institutional fork:** UK held evidence of ethical and practical limits, yet policy design pressed ahead regardless.  
- **Democratic cost:** scrutiny bodies can surface warnings, but without enforcement power they are absorbed and sidelined.  
- **Strategic lesson:** documenting the ignored evidence matters, because these moments show how inertia and political convenience override caution.
