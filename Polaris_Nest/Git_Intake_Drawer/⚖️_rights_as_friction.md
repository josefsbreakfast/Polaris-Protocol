# ⚖️ Rights as Friction  
*Why safeguards are treated as obstacles*
<!--Cf. ? behavoural nudges pre-Brexit; valuable target non-state actor possibilities for same industry. To research/check.-->
## Summary

This node explains why legal rights, courts, and accountability mechanisms are repeatedly framed as **friction** in modern governance — particularly when analytics platforms and security-oriented infrastructure are involved.

Rights do not fail because they are obsolete.  
They are treated as problems because they **slow systems down**.

## What “Friction” Means in This Context

In engineering and systems design, friction is anything that:
- slows throughput
- complicates flow
- resists optimisation
- introduces uncertainty

In governance, rights function in exactly this way.

They:
- interrupt automated processes
- require justification and explanation
- demand proportionality
- allow challenge and delay
- prioritise individuals over efficiency

From a systems perspective, this looks like inefficiency.  
From a democratic perspective, it is the point.

## Why Rights Collide with Platforms

Platforms like Palantir are designed to:
- accelerate decision-making
- compress complexity
- surface “actionable” insights
- reduce uncertainty for decision-makers

Rights frameworks, by contrast, insist on:
- uncertainty
- restraint
- explanation
- reversibility
- and contestability

These logics are fundamentally opposed.

As platforms scale, rights appear increasingly incompatible — not because rights are wrong, but because **they were never designed to be optimised away**.

## Courts as System Interrupts

Courts and legal processes:
- slow decisions
- reopen settled cases
- question assumptions
- demand evidence
- prioritise process over outcome

From a delivery-focused perspective, this is “blockage.”

From a rights perspective, it is **system correction**.

When governance relies heavily on analytics platforms:
- court oversight feels external
- judicial review feels disruptive
- legal uncertainty feels intolerable

This creates political pressure to:
- limit review
- narrow standing
- reframe rights as abuse
- or bypass courts altogether

## The ECHR Problem (Structural, Not Symbolic)

The European Convention on Human Rights constrains:
- automated decision-making without safeguards
- disproportionate surveillance
- group-based suspicion
- weak routes to redress
- executive overreach in security contexts

In platform-mediated governance, these constraints:
- slow deployment
- complicate procurement
- introduce legal risk
- and limit scale

This is why hostility to rights frameworks often increases **after** infrastructure is embedded.

The system is already running.  
The law is now “in the way.”

## Why Rights Fail First in Crisis

Under crisis conditions:
- urgency is moralised
- delay is framed as harm
- challenge is reframed as irresponsibility

Rights are recast as:
- luxuries
- technicalities
- activist obstruction
- or threats to security

This logic is especially powerful when:
- cyber insecurity is high
- geopolitical rhetoric escalates
- public fear is elevated

In such moments, rights do not disappear — they are **selectively suspended**.

---

## Friction Is a Feature, Not a Bug

Rights exist precisely because:
- systems make mistakes
- power concentrates
- harm is unevenly distributed
- efficiency benefits the powerful first

Friction:
- slows harm propagation
- exposes error
- creates space for challenge
- and protects minorities from optimisation logic

Removing friction does not make systems fairer.  
It makes them faster at doing harm.

---

## Who Pays the Cost When Friction Is Removed

When rights are treated as friction, the burden shifts to:
- migrants
- disabled people
- children in care
- welfare recipients
- over-policed communities
- political dissidents

These groups:
- cannot opt out
- cannot see the system
- cannot easily challenge outcomes

Efficiency is achieved by **externalising harm**.

---

## Why This Matters Now

As analytics platforms become embedded:
- rights are increasingly retrofitted
- safeguards become conditional
- accountability becomes procedural
- and reversal becomes politically costly

The question quietly shifts from:
> “Is this lawful and just?”

to:
> “Can we afford the delay?”

That shift marks a change in the character of governance.

## One-line takeaway

> Rights are called friction because they work — and systems that prioritise speed and control are structurally incentivised to erode them.
