*Integrating neuroscience of transition with survivor theory and institutional metamorphosis.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
In *Why Liminal Spaces Are Your Brain’s Secret Laboratory* (Big Think, 2025),  
the author reframes in-between states — the pause between endings and beginnings —  
as neurological laboratories for adaptation.  
These “threshold zones” show heightened neuroplasticity, emotional permeability,  
and imaginative recombination.  

For survivors, whistleblowers, or systems under reform,  
liminality is not a void but an incubator:  
the brain rehearses possible futures while the system unlearns obsolete scripts.

## 🔬 Key Insights  
- **Neuro-liminality:** transitional phases trigger default-mode network activity that fosters creativity and identity re-patterning.  
- **Productive uncertainty:** the disorientation of waiting, grieving, or reforming is a metabolically costly but generative process.  
- **Institutional parallels:** bureaucracies in audit, policy “pause,” or structural reform undergo collective liminality — neural, organisational, and narrative.  
- **Ethical frame:** respecting liminal time resists coercive acceleration and allows genuine recovery or transformation.

## 🌌 Constellations  
🫀 🪄 🌀 — Trauma, norms, and governance all share the same threshold mechanics.  
Each treats “pause” as deviance to be managed, rather than a phase to be tended.

*🧠 Thresholds of Change* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It extends *Trauma Psychology & Medical Misuse* with a neuro-ethical reading of liminal space,  
and cross-links to system and norm clusters exploring institutional pause and transformation.
