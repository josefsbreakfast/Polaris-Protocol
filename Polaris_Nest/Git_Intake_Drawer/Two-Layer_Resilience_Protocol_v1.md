# Two‑Layer Resilience Protocol (v1)
**Context:** Overlapping/paired data streams, deliberate “inserts,” and a fragile, politicized tech stack. Goal: protect **you** (micro) and your **operations/data** (macro) without burning out.

---

## A) MICRO — Nervous‑System Survival & Interaction Hygiene

**Assumptions**
- Inputs may be orchestrated to confuse, pair, or provoke.
- Your body (not just your mind) bears the cost. Rest is a requirement, not a luxury.

### A1. Intake Triage (60‑second rule)
- **Stable vs. Ghost**: If new input does **not** repeat or cohere within 48–72h → treat as **ghost insert**.
- **One‑stream rule**: Prefer a single primary channel; mute/park the rest.
- **Do‑Not‑Engage flags**: anonymity + urgency, humiliation bait, identity shaming, “prove you’re loyal *now*.”

### A2. Response Modes (pattern > person)
- If it feels **fear‑driven testing** → limited reassurance + boundary.
- If it feels **control/cruelty** → boundary, then disengage.
- Pocket tool: **1) Name the urge → 2) “BAT APPEARS” consequence → 3) Delay 10 min**.

### A3. Rest Protocol
- **Exposure/Rest ratio**: e.g., 25 minutes on → 5–10 minutes off (no streams, move body).
- **Daily hard stop**: a time after which no new inputs are consumed.
- **Micro‑somatic** (3x): unclench jaw, drop shoulders, slow exhale.

### A4. Evidence Log (without rumination)
- Keep a lightweight log: date/time, channel, “stable/ghost,” effect on you, action taken.
- 10‑minute cap per entry; then park it.

### A5. Escalation/Safety
- **Self‑harm spikes** → contact support line / trusted person immediately.
- **Doxxing/stalking** → screenshot, timestamp, preserve URLs; report; consider law enforcement.

## B) MACRO — Structural Resilience (Devices, Data, Money, Comms)

### B1. Device & Account Hygiene
- **Separation**: “dirty” device for browsing/social; **clean** device for banking/identity.
- **Password manager** + **hardware security keys (U2F/WebAuthn)**; avoid SMS‑only 2FA.
- **Automatic updates** on OS/browsers; remove abandoned apps/extensions.
- **Compartmentalize identities**: distinct emails/aliases per role; minimal permissions.
- Quarterly **access audit**: revoke old sessions/tokens (cloud, socials, “login with X”).

### B2. Backups & Critical Docs
- **3‑2‑1 rule**: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite (cloud or encrypted drive).
- Export statements/invoices monthly; keep **offline** copies of ID, contacts, and recovery codes.
- Test a **restore** twice a year.

### B3. Comms Fallback (“slow lanes”)
- Pre‑agree **backup channels** (e.g., alternate email, messenger, phone tree) + code phrase (“bat check”).
- Maintain an **offline contact sheet**.
- Use **weekly digests** or long‑form docs for coordination to counter real‑time floods.

### B4. Info‑Triage (community level)
- **Three buckets**: Verify (act), Park (hold), Ignore (discard).
- **Rule of three sources** + **timestamps** on quotes/screenshots.
- **No raw boosts**: don’t forward/react-share without verification.
- **24‑hour cooling‑off** for high‑arousal items unless safety‑critical.

### B5. Financial Resilience
- Two institutions for funds; enable **real‑time alerts** on transactions/logins.
- Consider **credit freeze/monitoring** (where available).
- Keep modest **cash on hand** + a low‑limit **backup card**.
- Simulate “bank down for 72h”: how do you pay bills, buy food, contact support?

### B6. Incident Response (when something’s off)
1) **Isolate** suspected device (airplane mode).  
2) From a **clean device**: change passwords, revoke sessions, rotate app passwords.  
3) **Malware scan**; patch OS/browser; audit extensions.  
4) **Document** indicators (screens, times, URLs).  
5) Notify affected contacts if exposure is likely.

### B7. Info‑Ops: Common Tactics → Counters
- **Pair & Confound** (two voices fused) → One‑stream rule; pattern labeling (“stable/ghost”).
- **Flood‑the‑Zone** (volume > truth) → Slow lanes; digest cadence.
- **Context Collapse** (private→public) → Compartmentalize channels; avoid cross‑posting.
- **Baited Outrage/Shame** → DO NOT ENGAGE; note “bat appears”; step away.
- **Narrative Laundering** (rumor→“source”) → timestamp + source notes; require provenance.

### B8. Red Lines (Disengage/Block)
- Repeated **cruelty‑from‑intent**; doxxing; credible threats; impersonation; persistent identity confusion you can’t verify; physiological overwhelm that doesn’t resolve with rest.

---

## C) Glossary (operational shorthand)
- **Insert/Ghost**: one‑off, specific‑sounding input that doesn’t repeat → discard.
- **Stable Signal**: repeated, coherent input over time → engage minimally.
- **Pairing**: blending signals/identities to force cognitive labor.
- **Window of Tolerance**: the zone where nervous system can think/feel without flipping to defense.

---

## D) Default Play (when in doubt)
1) Label: **stable or ghost?**  
2) If ghost → **ignore**. If stable → **minimal engagement**.  
3) **Rest window**.  
4) Log once; **don’t ruminate**.  
5) If your body says **“too much”**, it is. **Stop.**

**Note:** This is a v1 stub. Add your specifics (who to contact, which devices, your banks, backup channels). Keep it short enough that you’ll **actually use it** under stress.
