*Tracking the disappearance of CSE improvement reports as evidence in itself*

## 🧾 Concept  
The presence or absence of safeguarding review documents is not neutral.  
- **Kept online:** signals confidence, willingness to be scrutinised.  
- **Removed or hidden:** suggests reputational discomfort, fragility of reforms, or fear of renewed scrutiny.  
- **Archived elsewhere only:** indicates reputational management — “we complied at the time, but don’t want ongoing visibility.”

## 🕳️ Interpretation
- **Green (🟢):** Survives = confidence or ongoing scrutiny.  
- **Amber (🟡):** Buried = still exists, but only retrievable via archive.  
- **Red (🔴):** Removed = deliberate disappearance; strongest signal of reputational fragility.

*Negative Evidence Index* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It demonstrates that absence itself is evidence: where councils have erased safeguarding reports, it indicates unease, fragility, and a strategy of forgetting.
