# 🕯️ Witness Node: Cost of Mapping  
**First created:** 2025-09-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-10  
*A record of the labour and hurt carried in building Polaris.*

## ✦ Overview  
This is not analysis. It is testimony: that the clarity of Polaris Protocol exists only because a survivor kept going, at cost.  

## ✦ Survivor Account  
> “I’m quite hurt, and I’ve worked incredibly hard so far.”  

The mapping is forensic, but it is not neutral. Every diagram, every markdown, every index cross-link came from lived exhaustion and persistence.  

The cost is not only in hours worked, but in:  
- Carrying disbelief from institutions.  
- Surviving the erosion of trust in one’s own memory.  
- Bearing administrative burdens others refused.  

## ✦ Marker  
This file stands as a lantern: the Protocol itself is proof of labour already expended, not potential still demanded.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
