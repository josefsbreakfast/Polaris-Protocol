*Explores how private dynasties act as nonstate guardians of archives and artifacts, preserving material while enclosing it behind class barriers.*

## 🌐 Introduction  
When state institutions are destructive, negligent, or politically compromised, private dynasties sometimes act as custodians of knowledge and material culture. This guardianship can preserve, but it also encloses: access is restricted by class, wealth, or patronage.  

---

## I — The Function of Nonstate Custody  
- Families, trusts, and wealthy individuals often accumulate collections.  
- Motivations: prestige, curiosity, or eccentric obsession.  
- Effect: materials survive because they are hidden from state destruction or neglect.  

---

## II — Preservation by Elites  
- Example: Rothschild family archives and private libraries.  
- Collections kept intact during periods of war, state confiscation, or censorship.  
- By hoarding, they inadvertently protect items from destruction.  

---

## III — The Limits of Access  
- Guardianship = survival, but behind barriers.  
- Materials often inaccessible to the public, scholars, or communities of origin.  
- Risk: when heirs lose interest, collections are sold, fragmented, or disappear.  

---

## IV — From Private to Public  
- Many museums (e.g. British Museum, Wellcome Collection) originated in private hoards.  
- Common pattern: wealthy custodian → estate trust → public bequest.  
- Transformation is rarely neutral: the original framing and categorisation carries through.  

---

## Conclusion  
Nonstate custody is a paradox:  
- Preserves knowledge by keeping it out of destructive hands.  
- But reproduces class barriers by restricting access.  
- The role of guardianship is ambiguous: protective, but enclosing.
