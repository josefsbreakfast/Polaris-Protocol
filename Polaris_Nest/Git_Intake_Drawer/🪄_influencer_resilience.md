## Why visibility helps
- Frequent posts create third-party timestamps.  
- Independent corroboration from followers.  
- High cost of fabricating long-term persona.  

## Protective practices
- Selective breadcrumbs (short public post).  
- Multi-platform signals.  
- Keep originals hashed privately.  
- Organisational learning: encourage selective provenance.
