# 📚 Fictional Subject Construction  
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*How institutions invent characters to defend their own narratives.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores the bureaucratic practice of fabricating a “type of person” to absorb blame or risk.  
When procedures collapse under contradiction, organisations construct *fictional subjects*—composite personas drawn from bias, gossip, and selective data—to make the story hold together.  
The result is assessment theatre: a person is evaluated against a caricature that the institution itself authored.

## 📑 Key Sections  

1. **Character Fabrication**  
   - The subject is scripted before evidence is gathered.  
   - Behavioural “traits” are reverse-engineered to fit desired conclusions.  

2. **Narrative Coherence as Control**  
   - The aim is not truth but internal consistency: the story must reassure auditors, funders, and media.  
   - “Mental health” or “personality” labels become narrative glue.  

3. **Assessment Theatre**  
   - Meetings, reports, and risk reviews perform legitimacy while re-stating the fiction.  
   - The real person disappears behind a template of “problematic attributes.”  

4. **Containment by Character**  
   - Once the fiction stabilises, dissent can be pathologised.  
   - The constructed subject becomes the rationale for continued surveillance or exclusion.  

5. **Counter-Methods**  
   - Demand evidentiary linkage: *which data point shows this trait?*  
   - Document discrepancies between description and record.  
   - Use collective witness statements to re-anchor identity in observable fact.

1. **Character Fabrication and Revision**  
   - The subject is scripted before evidence is gathered.  
   - Behavioural “traits” are reverse-engineered to fit desired conclusions.  
   - As contradictions emerge, the profile is quietly **edited** — new adjectives replace old ones so the fiction remains self-consistent.  
   - Each update appears procedural (“re-assessment,” “follow-up review”) but functions as narrative maintenance.

2. **Narrative Coherence as Control**  
   - The aim is not truth but internal consistency: the story must reassure auditors, funders, and media.  
   - Personality labels or diagnostic framings become **version control** for institutional myth-keeping.

*📚 Fictional Subject Construction* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It exposes how organisations invent personas to preserve institutional coherence and deflect responsibility.
