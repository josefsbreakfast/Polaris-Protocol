# 🛡️🇬🇧🇮🇱 Overlap Node — British ↔ Israeli Security: Training, MoUs, Accountability

**First created:** 2025-10-07

## Why this node exists (executive summary)

When UK and Israeli security ecosystems interoperate — through training exchanges, shared facilities, joint exercises, vendor pipelines, or intelligence sharing — **accountability becomes obscured**. In the “black box works until it doesn’t” pattern, responsibility can be deferred across borders and bureaucracies, letting harm compound. This node maps the overlap and sets **due‑diligence dials** for policy, procurement, oversight, and public accountability.

> North Sea island democracy ≠ Levant settler-colony frontier. Different theatres, threats, and histories mean **techniques cannot be imported uncritically**. We set criteria for what may travel (if anything), under what guardrails, and who is answerable when it goes wrong.

## What we are talking about (scope)

* **Institutions (UK):** MoD, Home Office, FCDO, MI5/MI6/GCHQ, College of Policing, NCA, Border Force, CTSAs, police forces, DSTL, export control units.
* **Institutions (Israel):** IDF, ISA/Shin Bet, Mossad, Police Israel, COGAT (civilian administration in occupied territory), Defence Ministry procurement.
* **Vectors of overlap:**

  * Training & secondments (policing, counter‑terrorism, cyber, open‑source, HUMINT tradecraft).
  * **MoUs** and Joint Working Arrangements (often unpublished or partially redacted).
  * Vendor ecosystems and **dual‑use** tech (telecoms interception, spyware, IMSI/SS7, OSINT suites, crowd control, predictive analytics).
  * **Data sharing**: requests, tips, selectors, watchlists, deconfliction, de‑duplication.
  * **Facilities**: ranges, labs, demo sites, conferences/war games.

## The black‑box problem (patterns we see)

1. **Interchangeable language**: “liaison”, “capacity building”, “best practice” → hides **direction of influence** and **end‑use control**.
2. **Distributed authorisation**: each side says “they cleared it”; no one signs for **downstream harms**.
3. **Compliance theatre**: paper safeguards (OSJA, DPIAs, export licences) exist, but **monitoring and recall** are weak.
4. **Attribution gaps**: when tactics/tools are co‑developed or trained cross‑border, it’s easy to say **“that wasn’t us”**.
5. **Incentive flips**: in crises, one side may escalate to **make the other look reckless**; the other may over‑correct or double down to avoid reputational loss.

## Legal–ethical anchors we must hold (now verified)

* **ICJ advisory opinion (19 July 2024):** The Court concluded that Israel’s **prolonged occupation** of the Palestinian territory occupied since **1967** is **unlawful**, rendering Israel’s presence **unlawful** and giving rise to obligations of cessation and **full reparation**, and for **all States** not to recognize or aid the unlawful situation.
* **Territorial unit clarified:** The illegality relates to the **entirety of the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967** (West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza) as a single territorial unit.
* **UK due‑diligence frameworks:** OSJA, Export Control Order 2008, Consolidated Criteria (risk of serious IHL violations), Wassenaar, Investigatory Powers Act oversight (IPCO). These bind **training, data‑sharing, and exports**; caveats exist for multinational programmes (e.g., **F‑35 global**).
* **Command responsibility translated:** Liability analysis must include **knowledge‑transfer chains** (training, doctrine, targeting heuristics), not only kinetic operations.

### Party, policy, and licensing facts (verified)

* **Green Party (England & Wales) Conference — 5 Oct 2025:** Members **voted to call for** the IDF to be **proscribed as a terrorist organisation**. This is **party policy**, not UK law.
* **UK export‑licence posture:** On **2 Sep 2024** the UK **suspended ~29–30 licences** covering items that might be used in **Gaza/OPT**, while **retaining licences** linked to the **global F‑35 programme** (Israel a potential end‑user). Government management information on **31 Jul 2025** confirms this posture.
* **Context note:** Commons Library briefings (Jan 2025) summarise the suspension scope (components for F‑16s, UAV parts, naval systems, targeting equipment) and its limits.

---

## Material differences between the theatres (do not skip)

* **Geography:** archipelago with allied neighbours vs. **frontier state** embedded amid regional instability shaped by UK/US/EU histories.
* **Threat model:** island CT + right‑wing terror + NI legacy vs. **occupation/settler‑violence dynamics**, cross‑border armed groups, siege/closure logistics.
* **Civic risk:** chilling effects in UK dissent spaces when tactics (e.g., protest surveillance, collective punishment heuristics) are **imported without context**.

## MoU & training hygiene — acceptance criteria

Use this **gate** before signing or renewing any UK↔IL cooperation instrument.

**A. Purpose & necessity**

* Clear, narrow objective; no “best practice” vagueness.
* Evidence that technique is **fit‑for‑theatre** (UK context) and won’t shortcut UK‑specific safeguards.

**B. End‑use & recall controls**

* End‑use statements with **recall/cessation triggers** tied to IHL/HR violations.
* Independent monitoring + **public reporting cadence**.

**C. No‑go techniques (red lines)**

* Population‑level punishment logics, settlement enforcement tactics, profiling templates built from **occupation heuristics**.
* Spyware/tooling with unresolved prior **abuse findings**.

**D. Naming the responsible officer(s)**

* UK Senior Responsible Owner + legal sign‑off + inspectorate that will audit **actual practice**, not just paperwork.

**E. Survivors & civilians in the loop**

* Structured harm review with **civilian testimony** channels; remedy pathways if UK‑linked elements contribute to harm.

## Accountability matrix (who signs for what)

| Phase      | UK actor                       | IL actor              | Documentation       | Failure mode                         | Remedy/stop switch                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Scoping    | FCDO OSJA lead                 | MoD/IDF J7 training   | OSJA, DPIA          | Scope creep                          | Publish scope; re‑OSJA if scope shifts         |
| Authorise  | SoS (trade/defence)            | DM procurement        | Export licence, MoU | Licence caveats ignored              | Licence suspension protocol, notify Parliament |
| Delivery   | College of Policing / MoD unit | IDF/Police/ISA school | Training plan       | Off‑syllabus practices               | Observer embeds, real‑time halt clause         |
| Monitoring | IPCO/ICIBI/NFAC                | MIL/DoJ unit          | Audit logs          | No logs, or redaction sprawl         | Randomised audits, escalate to halt            |
| Incident   | Dept + HMG Law Officers        | MoJ/AG Office         | Incident report     | “Not our kit/not our training” dodge | Joint fact‑finding with public summary         |

## Public mandate signals (timeline)

* **19 Jul 2024 — ICJ:** Occupation unlawful; States owe **non‑recognition**/**non‑assistance** duties.
* **2 Sep 2024 — UK export controls:** ~29 licences **suspended** on IHL‑risk grounds; **F‑35 global** carve‑out persists. Public debate intensifies over complicity risk and scope of suspensions.
* **5 Oct 2025 — Green Party (E&W):** Conference backs motion to **proscribe IDF** (party policy; non‑binding on HMG).

## Risks of laundering & how to stop it

* **Technique laundering:** training re‑branded as “community safety”.
* **Legitimacy laundering:** joint photo‑ops to sanitise contested tactics.
  **Counter‑moves:**
* Force **plain‑language summaries** of what changed in UK practice as a result of cooperation.
* Attach **sunset clauses** + renewal votes.
* Require **negative control trials** (prove a technique isn’t causing net harm).

## 🏾 Footer

This node is a living accountability scaffold. It assumes **survivor authorship is sovereign** and that “containment is never neutral.”
Additions welcome — but **no neutralisation edits** without logging both rationale and impact on survivors.
