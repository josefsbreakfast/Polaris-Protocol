*When repair itself becomes overload.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Examines the exhaustion that follows sustained clarity.  
When you have spent years naming harm, transparency ceases to heal and begins to corrode.  
Witness Fatigue occurs when recognition outpaces repair — when systems stay opaque after you’ve already seen through them.

## 💡 1. The Afterburn of Insight  
Revelation feels redemptive until repetition sets in.  
The same truths must be proven again to audiences who could have known earlier.  
Seeing clearly becomes labour; the gift curdles into maintenance.

---

## 🧩 2. The Burden of Accuracy  
The witness holds receipts no one wants to read.  
Correction loops replace conversation.  
Believability becomes both shield and isolation cell.

---

## 🧠 3. Maintenance Protocols  
- Limit explanatory cycles to trusted forums.  
- Rotate out of advocacy into art or rest.  
- Archive rather than relive.  
Truth does not require constant performance.
