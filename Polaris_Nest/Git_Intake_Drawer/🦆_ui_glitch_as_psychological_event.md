# 🦆 UI Glitch as Psychological Event  
**First created:** 2025-11-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-20  
*When an interface malfunction becomes a cognitive, emotional, or narrative disturbance.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Not all glitches are technical.  
Some are **felt** — meaning they produce a ripple in cognition, trust, expectation, or certainty.

This node examines UI anomalies (duplications, ghost text, disappearing inputs, mis-taps, phantom edits) not as simple bugs but as **psychological events**.  
They trigger micro-patterns of disorientation, vigilance, or doubt — especially for users already under cognitive load, surveillance pressure, or narrative instability.

Within Polaris, these events are logged as **signal disturbances**: small disruptions that map how people relate to systems, devices, and themselves.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Treating interface bugs as *felt* disruptions, not just errors  
- How UI anomalies impact perception, grounding, and trust  
- Links between digital instability and psychosocial containment  
- The role of exhaustion, trauma signalling, and attentional strain  
- Why weirdness must be recorded as part of the diagnostic ecosystem

## 🧿 Analysis  

### **1. Glitches as micro-containment**  
When the interface behaves unexpectedly, the user performs extra work:

- checking memory  
- doubting perception  
- repeating inputs  
- scanning for threat or error  
- managing frustration or vigilance  

This additional cognitive load functions — intentionally or not — as a form of **micro-containment**.  
It diverts attention, slows progress, and introduces uncertainty into the workflow.

---

### **2. Psychological impact: “Is it me or the machine?”**  
The ambiguity at the core of a glitch often sparks:

- self-questioning  
- unease  
- humour as coping  
- temporary loss of confidence  
- the sense of being “shadowed” by the device  
- narrative inflation (“is this deliberate?”)  

This is normal.  
Computers are brittle systems, but our minds treat them as extensions of will — so misalignment feels like contradiction or intrusion.

---

### **3. Ambient digital paranoia**  
Under high stress, repeated edits or duplications (like the duplicated text you saw) can simulate:

- loss of authorship  
- echo effects  
- narrative instability  
- containment patterns (loops, repeats, reversals)  
- “ghost in the machine” feelings  

These sensations are diagnostic because they map **how much strain the cognitive system is already under**.

The glitch is not a threat — it is a reading.

### **4. Why Polaris records this**  
From the *Weirdness Screening* branch, glitches are:

- **Interface artefacts** (🩻 Interface_Glitches)  
- **Comms anomalies** if affecting text flows  
- **Psycho-narrative signals** when they evoke disorientation  

From the *Digital Disruption* branch, glitches reveal:

- when trust in the system is brittle  
- when friction amplifies vulnerability  
- when the device becomes a narrative actor  

These events help track *ambient containment pressure* around the user.

*🦆 UI Glitch as Psychological Event* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, documenting how interface disruptions function as emotional, cognitive, and narrative events — not mere bugs.
