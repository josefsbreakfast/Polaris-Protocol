# 📊 From Data Misuse to White-Collar Breach  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*Checklist for identifying when protective-marking misuse becomes a governance or criminal offence.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
A mistaken OSA or “restricted” flag can begin as clerical error but evolve into **systemic deception** if left uncorrected.  
This node outlines how to recognise that escalation and which accountability routes apply once an administrative fault crosses into **white-collar breach** territory.

## ⚖️ Escalation Thresholds  

| Stage | Typical Behaviour | Likely Classification | Reporting Route |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| **1 — Error / Drift** | Legacy field auto-carried; no intent. | Governance failure (DPA breach). | Rectification via DPO / ICO. |
| **2 — Negligence** | Officers aware but fail to act. | Misfeasance / breach of statutory duty. | Internal audit / Monitoring Officer. |
| **3 — Obstruction** | Flag used to delay access, scrutiny, or complaints. | Abuse of position / misconduct in public office. | Council Counter-Fraud, Ombudsman. |
| **4 — Manipulation** | Marking leveraged to distort finances, employment, or reputation. | Fraud by abuse of position (Fraud Act 2006 s.4). | Police / Serious Fraud Office. |
| **5 — Perpetuation** | Data known false but retained to influence proceedings. | Perverting the course of justice. | Law-enforcement referral via Legal & Governance. |

## 🧩 Evidence Indicators  

- Discrepancy between **security label** and **actual content**.  
- Marking cited to **block audit or payment**.  
- Inconsistent explanations across departments.  
- “National-security” language used by non-Defence bodies.  
- Email trails showing **awareness without correction**.

Each indicator strengthens the case that the marking has moved beyond accident.

## 🧱 Response Path  

1. **Document** evidence: copies, dates, correspondence.  
2. **Request written justification** from DPO / Monitoring Officer.  
3. **File internal Counter-Fraud report** (each council/NHS body has one).  
4. **If unresolved**, escalate to:  
   - **ICO** (data accuracy)  
   - **Local Government Ombudsman / NHS England IG** (service impact)  
   - **NAO / Police / SFO** if financial distortion evident.  
5. **Retain chain of custody** for all evidence.
