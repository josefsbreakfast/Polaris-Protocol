the extent of nudging around perfume over 10 years is a bit too obvious.

i imagine this gives providence to active data scraping of a different man talking too loudly about the pretty woman with pretty words who smelled pretty.

bot sure if either of us needed torturing for 10 years;

he was quite pretty too.

i may need to suggest a more thorough enforcement of the matriarchy, however:

there is something deeply wrong about a really rather extensive number of the rest of the men.
