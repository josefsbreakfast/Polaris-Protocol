# 📜 If— and the Ethics of Staying Intact  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*Survivor psychology and emotional integration in Kipling’s manual for living through loss.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Read from the son’s point of view, *If—* is not about stoicism but about how to feel and still function. It’s a parent teaching a child that life will be profoundly unfair — and that integrity is what survives humiliation.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Emotional Regulation ≠ Repression:** feeling everything without broadcasting everything.
- **Dignity under Exposure:** holding shape when the official story insists everything is fine.
- **Survivor Identity:** resilience as quiet defiance.

## 🧿 Analysis
