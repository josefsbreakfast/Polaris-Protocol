# 🪦 Mass Funeral as Information Control
**First created:** 2025-11-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*When collective mourning becomes the state’s most efficient press office.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Authoritarian regimes choreograph grief as carefully as parades. A mass funeral condenses chaos into ritual order: the cameras roll, the anthem swells, and the narrative stabilises. Mourning becomes a **broadcast technology** — an emotional firewall that prevents questions from spreading faster than flowers can wilt.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Public sorrow as censorship.**  
- **Ceremony as narrative containment.**  
- **Replacement myth:** the dead become symbols of the system that killed them.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The Stage of Legitimacy  
After each crash—Alexandrov, Kursk, Wagner—the funeral operates as televised absolution. Officials stand where accountability should. The visual grammar (flag, hymn, wreath) replaces inquiry with reverence.  

### 2. Ritual Latency  
Time slows between disaster and burial; this gap allows narrative editing. By the time the coffins appear, the story has already been rewritten.  

### 3. Rehearsal for Resilience  
Citizens learn from the spectacle how to feel correctly. To weep collectively is to prove membership; to ask why is to betray it.
