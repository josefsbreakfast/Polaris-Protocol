# NOTICE â€” Temporary Publishing & Safety Notice (Short)

We are currently operating under an active security incident (SEC-2025-09). You may see a temporary slowing of merges, additional review requirements, and a holding area called the *Git intake drawer* where sensitive or suspicious drafts are staged. The author is prioritizing safety, privacy, and legal risk mitigation while continuing to publish because public posting materially supports access to civic processes and accountability.

If you discover risky content, please file an issue labeled `security-signal` or `legal-risk` and do not amplify the content outside the issue.
