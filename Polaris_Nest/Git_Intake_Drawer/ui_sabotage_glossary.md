# 💾 Glossary: Save-Blocking, UI Sabotage, and Frustration Loops

This glossary covers different terms used across cybersecurity, UX, and design psychology to describe situations where you try to **save/commit work**, but the system disrupts you.

---

## 🔐 Cybersecurity / Harassment Terms
- **Denial-of-save** *(informal)*: targeted blocking of persistence actions, preventing your work from being stored.  
- **Clickjacking**: manipulating the UI so what you think you’re clicking (“Save”) isn’t actually performed.  
- **Event injection**: malicious code triggers false error messages or reload loops when you attempt to save.  
- **Griefing** *(from gaming)*: deliberate disruption to frustrate or demoralise a user.  
- **UI sabotage**: generic term for hostile interference with interface functions.

## 🎨 UX / Design Psychology Terms
- **Dark patterns**: manipulative design strategies that intentionally frustrate or mislead the user.  
- **Frustration loop**: a cycle where the system presents an action, then repeatedly denies it.  
- **Interface sabotage**: deliberate design/manipulation making desired actions fail.  
- **Deceptive affordances**: buttons/links appear to allow an action but actually do nothing or something else.

## ⚖️ Choosing the Right Term
- Emphasise **malicious attack** → use *denial-of-save*, *UI sabotage*, or *griefing*.  
- Emphasise **systemic manipulative design** → use *dark pattern* or *frustration loop*.  
- Emphasise **technical exploit mechanics** → use *clickjacking* or *event injection*.

👉 Everyday shorthand: **“save-blocking”** or **“frustration loop”** both capture the feeling of being about to hit save and getting denied.
