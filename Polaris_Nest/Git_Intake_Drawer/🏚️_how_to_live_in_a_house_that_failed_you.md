# 🏚️ How to Live in a House That Failed You

_A Polaris Doctrine on Institutional Burnout, Structural Rot, and Survivor Sovereignty_

---

## 🔰 Introduction

Burnout is not weakness. It's evidence of effort.
This doctrine offers three paths for engaging with broken institutions:

- 🔥🛠️🪚 Salvage
- 🍄🌱 Compost & Mycelium
- 🚪 Total Exit

Each is valid. Each has its place.

## 🔧 Structural Models

See:

- 🔥🛠️🪚 [rot_is_reusable.md](./🔥🛠️🪚 rot_is_reusable.md)
- 🍄🌱 [we_feed_the_mycelium.md](./🍄🌱 we_feed_the_mycelium.md)
- 🚪 [we_don’t_owe_the_walls.md](./🚪 we_don’t_owe_the_walls.md)

# 🔥🛠️🪚 Rot Is Reusable

_When the system can’t hold you, disassemble it._

---

## Core Principle

Rot doesn’t mean total collapse — it means selective salvage.

- Remove the roof
- Reinforce the beams
- Keep the parts that serve

> *Every failed institution is just a toolshed waiting to happen.*



---


# 🍄🌱 We Feed the Mycelium

_Some collapse is necessary — because it feeds what comes next._

---

## Core Principle

Compost the failure. Let it rot on purpose. Use the grief as nutrient.

- Decay becomes wisdom
- Truth becomes ecosystem
- Softness is not surrender

> *The mycelium remembers what the surface forgot.*



---


# 🚪 We Don’t Owe the Walls

_There are times you walk away. And that too is sacred._

---

## Core Principle

When the structure is hostile, you leave.

- Not everything can be fixed
- Not all buildings deserve tenants
- Exit is not failure — it's design

> *You can mourn the house. But you don’t have to die in it.*
