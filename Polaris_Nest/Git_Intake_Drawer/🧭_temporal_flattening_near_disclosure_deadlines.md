## üõ∞Ô∏è Orientation  

This log documents a repeating four-week cycle often felt in the run-up to statutory disclosure points.  

Pattern noted:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 1 ‚Äî Impact:** overt disruption or agitation; visible interference.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 2 ‚Äî Emotional recursion:** narrative or ‚Äúlove-story‚Äù fixation; affective confusion.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 3 ‚Äî Flattening:** energy drop, procedural calm, sense of time dilation.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 4 ‚Äî Deadline proximity:** attention diffused, external correspondence slows.

## ü™û Reflections  

- How does **tempo** shift across the month?  
- Where do you feel the **flattening** most strongly (body, focus, communication)?  
- What restores rhythm or agency, even briefly?

## üßÆ Forensic Logging ‚Äî Micro-Distortions and Drift  

Over this cycle, a pattern has emerged around subtle textual or tonal alterations.  
After clearing the `gitintakedraw` folder two weeks before the FOIA deadline, new fragments began to accumulate again ‚Äî small notes, partial drafts, and near-duplicates of existing nodes.  

The changes are rarely obvious.  
Instead of whole deletions or crashes, there are **micro-tweaks**: a word replaced, a phrase softened, a key connector removed.  
Each is small enough to pass unnoticed, yet together they **tilt meaning** and **flatten affect**.  

Common signs:  
- Dictation outputs that alter phrasing during transcription.  
- Versions where emotionally charged sentences become placating or neutral.  
- Continuous, almost invisible edits that make a survivor‚Äôs account sound less precise or less certain.  

These are worth logging not as proof of any single event but as **pattern evidence** of containment logic at work.  
Each small drift can be timestamped and archived beside the original.  
Even minimal variance, tracked across time, reveals the system‚Äôs preference for calm over clarity.
