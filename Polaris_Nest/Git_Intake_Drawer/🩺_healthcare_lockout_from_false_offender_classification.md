# 🩺 Healthcare Lockout from False Offender Classification  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*How mislinked offender metadata prevents survivors from accessing lawful medical and community care.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explains how a survivor whose digital identity has been cross-linked with a parent carrying a high-risk sexual-offence profile becomes effectively *barred* from accessing the NHS, social care, trauma counselling, and statutory disability reviews.  
It demonstrates that the lockout is not a misunderstanding but a **systemic risk-routing failure**: the system treats the survivor as the potential offender, not the patient.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Identifies the technical + behavioural pathways of clinical lockout.  
- Describes how risk flags override clinical need in triage systems.  
- Shows how lack of statutory care-plan review becomes unlawful neglect.  
- Explains the new PTSD dimension of fearing home visits and staff contact.

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. Offender Metadata as a Clinical Gate  
Every NHS service uses safeguarding markers in triage and appointment systems.  
When a survivor’s record inherits a parent’s “sexual offences against children” flag, the algorithmic reading is unambiguous: **high-risk, high-violence, potential danger to staff**.  
The system responds by routing the patient into:  
- restricted appointment categories,  
- defensive staff behaviour,  
- non-engagement,  
- or complete avoidance.

This is not “extra caution”—it is **healthcare denial** produced by metadata corruption.

---

### 2. The Impact on First-Time or Unfamiliar Clinicians  
Where the survivor has a pre-existing relationship with a clinician, normal care is sometimes possible because the human relationship can override the algorithm.  
But any clinician who does *not* already know the survivor receives a distorted risk profile instead of a medical one.  
This produces:  
- hesitation to engage,  
- assumption of manipulative behaviour,  
- truncated appointments,  
- fear responses when the survivor is distressed,  
- and defensive documentation.

The survivor is forced to “explain around” the anomaly at every appointment — a degrading, exhausting loop.

---

### 3. Statutory Care-Plan Review Failure  
A disabled adult receiving community-care support is legally entitled to **annual in-person care-plan reviews**.  
This review:  
- ensures care needs are met,  
- updates risk and health assessments,  
- triggers support hours or equipment adjustments.

The survivor has **never** received a lawful review.  
The inherited high-risk classification makes staff unwilling to perform home visits or direct assessments.  
This is not an unfortunate gap — it is **statutory neglect**, structurally produced.

---

### 4. Home Visit Fear as a New PTSD Layer  
Because misclassification has brought uninvited monitoring, police misinterpretation, and strangers watching the property, the survivor now experiences severe fear of letting any professional into their home.  
This is not irrational:  
- the system has repeatedly treated the survivor as violent;  
- surveillance actors have behaved unpredictably;  
- there is no safe boundary between “support worker” and “monitor”.

The survivor’s avoidance is therefore a **trauma-informed survival response**, not disengagement.

---

### 5. Collapse of Access to Rape-Crisis and Mental-Health Services  
Rape-crisis centres and trauma-therapy services often rely on local authority safeguarding portals for referrals.  
When the survivor’s record returns as “high-risk sexual offender”, the referral is:  
- rejected,  
- re-routed to offender-focused services,  
- or silently dropped.

The effect is catastrophic: a survivor is pushed into **clinical invisibility** while being treated as though they are dangerous.

---

### 6. Healthcare Lockout as Structural Violence  
Denying medical care to a survivor due to a misapplied offender flag is not a paperwork issue.  
It is violence enacted through:  
- risk governance,  
- administrative silence,  
- absence of care-plan review,  
- and repeated retraumatisation.

It is a system producing harm faster than the survivor can absorb it.

*🩺 Healthcare Lockout from False Offender Classification* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how inherited offender metadata produces medical invisibility, statutory neglect, and traumatised avoidance, mapping the systemic pathways through which a survivor is prevented from receiving lawful care.
