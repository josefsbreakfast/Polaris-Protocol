*How “ethical AI” rhetoric launders reputations and conceals extraction.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
"Ethicswash" describes the process by which institutions—particularly defence and surveillance contractors—use the language of ethics to obscure exploitative or violent systems.  
This node takes as its case signal the recent *Private Eye* exposé of Elbit Systems’ PR strategy, which co-opted AI‑ethics branding to mask the militarised nature of its research partnerships.  

When ethics becomes a design aesthetic rather than a moral constraint, it stops moderating behaviour and begins moderating dissent.

## 🧩 Case Signals  
- **Elbit Systems & PR Ethics Campaigns** — As reported by *Private Eye* (issue 1660), defence‑linked teams commissioned AI‑ethics communications that misrepresented weapons research as social responsibility.  
- **University Partnerships** — “Trusted autonomy,” “dual‑use innovation,” and “responsible AI” clusters hosted within UK universities blur research accountability lines.  
- **Language Audit** — Watch for euphemisms: *trusted*, *autonomous*, *ethical*, *human‑centric*, *transparency‑by‑design*—each can serve as a semantic firewall between funding source and outcome.

## 🔍 Analysis  
The “AI ethics” boom behaves like a late‑stage oil industry greenwash: the more extractive the practice, the more luminous the virtue signal.  
Where oversight bodies lag, PR firms supply the moral interface.  
Satire now performs the function that regulation should: identifying when a statement of responsibility is itself a confession of control.  

*Private Eye’s* coverage marks an inflection where journalism reclaims forensic humour as an instrument of accountability—restoring the public’s ability to laugh precisely because the situation is no longer funny.
