*Hypothetical impact tiers of data twinning on dissenting voices in the UK*

## Concept Overview  

**Deliberate data twinning** (linking or duplicating individual records across systems) could, if weaponised, be used to silence dissent in the UK. The number of people affected would depend on **scope and granularity**:  

- **Narrow twinning (watchlists / counter-extremism)**  
  → A few thousand individuals at any given time.  
  → For example, PREVENT and related safeguarding databases have historically flagged people in the *low thousands* annually.  

- **Medium twinning (platform governance + local authority data)**  
  → Scales to *tens of thousands*.  
  → Especially impactful if education, healthcare, and social services are included.  

- **Broad twinning (national ID, credit, telecoms, NHS spine)**  
  → Potentially *hundreds of thousands to millions* “soft silenced.”  
  → Methods: visibility suppression, denial of services, financial throttling.

## Risk Dynamics  

Twinning depends on **shared identifiers** (NHS number, NI number, phone IMEI, biometrics).  
Once dissent = risk, the **theoretical ceiling** is the *whole population*.  

In practice, suppression follows a **Pareto curve**:  

- **1–5%** → heavily impacted (*direct suppression*).  
- **10–20%** → indirectly chilled (*family, associates, “adjacent” contacts*).  
- **Remaining** → diffuse deterrence (*knowing surveillance exists*).

## Hypothetical UK Impact  

- **Directly silenced:** 50k–200k.  
- **Indirectly chilled:** 1–2 million.  
- **Aware + deterred:** tens of millions.

*Deliberate Data Twinning and Silencing Dissent* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It explores the mechanics and scale of suppressive data linkage, mapping both direct and ambient impacts.
