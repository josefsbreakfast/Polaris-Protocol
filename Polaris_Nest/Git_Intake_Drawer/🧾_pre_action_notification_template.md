*note: i have to save the docs online and it must be with public-facing means;*  
*i am not adequately reassured of any data security improvements and the cybersec issue is ongoing.*
*bear in mind the ai i use gets jailbroken often and this may also be impacted -- caution for docs taken to be "as-is";*  
*taking "as is" also means accepting the conditions described as being true and relevant and therefore may not represent what the author inputs into the machine.*
*ai remains a safety net to negotiate the cognitive issues from long-standing CIDT.*  
*CIDT already reported to UN bodies.*  

I'm warning you because docs like this tend to get...  

Mangled.
