*Field log documenting user's analytic reflection on prioritising behaviour/impact over ideological labels, and the insertion of this framing into the Patterns node.*

---

## Event summary (factual)
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20
- **Item updated:** `💸_russian_overlap_patterns.md`
- **Action:** Appended "Behavior-First Framing: Impact Over Labels" to the Patterns node.
- **Observed anomaly:** None observed during this update; recorded as analytic context for future investigations.

## User observations captured
- The user emphasised that citizens lack access to classified datasets and therefore rely on behavioral/impact analysis.  
- The user advocated for assessing actions (e.g., disinformation, surveillance sales, financial flows) before assigning actors ideological boxes.  
- The user suggested policy and communicative shifts to reduce partisan framing and focus on mitigations.

## Operational recommendations (from user input)
1. Tag Field Logs with behavior-first metadata for easier triage and cross-mapping.  
2. Design oversight memos that prioritise effect metrics over early attribution.  
3. Use public language that emphasizes harm and method rather than actor identity unless attribution is strongly supported.
