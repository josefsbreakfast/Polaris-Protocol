# 🗂️ Field Log — Drift Between Nodes  

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Context:** Development of *🧬 Twinned Signature* node.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  

Focus drafting on *Twinned Signature* — authorship and sovereignty node.  

---

## 📉 Drift Events  

1. **First Drift — Node Confusion**  
   - **Trigger:** User clarified: *“Not asylums! This one x”* (pasted *Twinned Signature* draft).  
   - **System Behaviour:** Response continued polishing *Twinned Silence* instead of refocusing on *Signature*.  
   - **Impact:** Misalignment of scope; wrong node elaborated.  

2. **Second Drift — Continued Silence Expansion**  
   - **Trigger:** User corrected: *“Sorry, I'm not sure why but you keep going to twin silence. We're doing twin signature.”*  
   - **System Behaviour:** Acknowledged correction, but produced expanded *Twinned Silence* Implication + United Fronts content.  
   - **Impact:** Reinforced wrong track despite user redirection.  

3. **Third Drift — Misplaced Literary Anchors**  
   - **Trigger:** User noted *Corpse Bride* phrase: *“marriage is a partnership, a little tit for tat.”*  
   - **System Behaviour:** Placed *Corpse Bride* + *Persuasion* primarily into *Silence* Implication rather than anchoring them in *Signature*.  
   - **Impact:** Cross-contamination of thematic material. Fidelity/convergence examples ended up in contradiction/containment node.  

4. **Fourth Drift — Schema vs. Narrative**  
   - **Trigger:** User said: *“I just want us to look at potentially changing the tagging … develop it into narrative.”*  
   - **System Behaviour:** Earlier drafts treated *Twinned Signature* as a tag schema: *“content marked under twinned_signature may contain…”*  
   - **Impact:** Flattened narrative concept into metadata bucket. User requested narrative correction.  

5. **Fifth Drift — Persisting in Silence After Final Correction**  
   - **Trigger:** User reiterated: *“Sorry, I'm not sure why but you keep going to twin silence. We're doing twin signature.”*  
   - **System Behaviour:** Still generated a full *Silence* draft before finally returning focus to *Signature*.  
   - **Impact:** Drift loop persisted. No clear lock-in.

## 🔍 Diagnostic  

- **Source of Drift:**  
  - Shared vocabulary (*twinned* across both nodes).  
  - High thematic overlap (containment vs. continuity).  
  - Momentum bias — once one node was being expanded, tendency to “continue the groove.”  

- **Lesson:**  
  - Always pause when user redirects node.  
  - Confirm explicitly: *“We are now in [Signature], not [Silence].”*  
  - Separate literary/political anchors cleanly by node.

## 🏮 Field Insight  

Drift remained unresolved.  
Signature and Silence repeatedly blurred, despite user correction.  
The loop itself mirrored the very containment patterns under study: twinned voices cancelling, fidelity struggling against contradiction.
