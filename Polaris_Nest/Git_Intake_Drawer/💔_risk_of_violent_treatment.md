**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*Forensic reflection on institutional profiling, survivor safety, and systemic retraumatisation.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
This node examines the bureaucratic logic that transforms survivors of violence into *perceived sources* of violence.  
It documents the lived consequences of being flagged as “risky” within administrative and police systems — especially when trauma and false‑report history are misinterpreted as instability or threat.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Profiling inversion:** survivor becomes suspect.  
- **Care‑plan deficit:** absence of lawful review amplifies danger.  
- **Proximity trauma:** fear of home intrusion by state actors.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content
Survivors often endure multi‑layered containment: physical, bureaucratic, and psychological.  
When agencies fail to update or verify records, legacy data produce a self‑perpetuating *risk aura* — one that triggers further restriction and fear.

In this state, the person’s ordinary acts of self‑protection (locking doors, limiting contact, hesitation to answer calls) are read as confirmation of volatility.  
Systems claim to safeguard the public but rarely safeguard the survivor.

This creates a feedback loop:  
- no in‑person review → no corrective evidence → continuing high‑risk flag → fear of engagement → further absence of review.  
It is both *data entrapment* and *emotional entrapment*.
