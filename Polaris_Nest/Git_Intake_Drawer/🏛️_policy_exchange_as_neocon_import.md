*How a “sensible” UK think tank launders US-style neoliberal and neoconservative agendas*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Founded in 2002 by Michael Gove, Francis Maude, Nick Boles.  
- Presents as a “sensible” policy institute, but acts as a **policy laundromat**:  
  - Donor-funded ideas → glossy reports → cited by ministers → echoed in press.  
- Imports US think-tank strategies (Heritage, AEI, Hudson) into UK politics.  

---

## Policy Themes  

### Migration & Borders  
- Advocates offshoring, detention expansion, and curbs on judicial review.  
- Provides intellectual cover for “stop the boats.”  

### Policing & Surveillance  
- Major influence on Prevent and counter-extremism frameworks.  
- Pushes for expanded police powers under the guise of security.  

### Culture War  
- Reports on free speech, statues, “woke universities.”  
- Seeds narratives picked up by GB News, Mail, Spectator.  

---

## Why It Matters  
- Gives radical reforms a veneer of legitimacy.  
- Functions as the **bridge** between donors, media outrage, and parliamentary action.
