*How harm is produced and sustained by automated systems acting at scale*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
Not all violence is direct, intentional, or interpersonal.

Some harms are produced by systems whose core functions are classification, optimisation, and replication. When those systems amplify, preserve, or repeatedly surface harmful material, they can generate injury without a perpetrator acting in the present tense.

This node frames algorithmic violence as ecological: distributed, persistent, and structurally produced.

## ✨ Key Features
- Harm can continue without current intent or active actors.
- Replication systems preserve semantics while stripping context.
- Exposure becomes environmental: ambient, repeated, and hard to “close.”
- Attribution becomes diffuse: many contributing systems, no single owner.
- The result is lived impact that is often illegible to law and institutions.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content

### 1) Core claim: harm without a present actor
Algorithmic violence occurs when automated systems enact conditions that predictably harm people — even if no single human is choosing to harm them now.

This is not “machines are evil.”
It is: optimisation + scale + replication can produce violence-like outcomes as a byproduct.

### 2) Why this is an ecology (not a line)
Algorithmic violence is ecological because it involves:
- multiple systems interacting,
- feedback loops,
- persistence over time,
- uneven exposure,
- and cumulative effects.

No single system is fully responsible.
The harm emerges from combined behaviour across the environment.

### 3) Common mechanism bundle
Algorithmic violence is typically produced through combinations of:
- indexing without context,
- ranking without meaning,
- replication without decay,
- aggregation without consent,
- optimisation for engagement rather than accuracy,
- automated classification using proxy signals.

These mechanisms can act on:
- harassment remnants,
- defamatory material,
- threat-shaped language,
- misindexed identity data,
- historically hostile content.

### 4) Persistence without intent
Unlike interpersonal harm, algorithmic violence often continues after:
- the original behaviour has stopped,
- a report has been filed,
- a case has closed,
- or the originating material has been removed.

Replication systems preserve fragments, strip context, and re-surface meaning without agency.

This produces impact without a current actor.

### 5) Lived effects
From the perspective of the affected person, algorithmic violence appears as:
- repeated exposure without interaction,
- difficulty establishing “closure,”
- an environment that feels hostile despite no new actions,
- constant interpretive labour to assess risk,
- erosion of trust in systems presented as neutral.

The harm is environmental rather than confrontational.

### 6) Distinction from abuse or harassment
| Interpersonal harm | Algorithmic violence |
|---|---|
| actor-driven | system-driven |
| intentional | non-intentional |
| event-based | persistent |
| direct | ambient |
| legible to law | often illegible |

This does not reduce severity.
It changes attribution and mitigation strategy.

### 7) Why this matters
If harm is framed only as individual wrongdoing:
- structural contributors disappear,
- responsibility is misplaced,
- and affected people are left managing systemic residue alone.

Recognising algorithmic violence clarifies why “nothing new is happening” can still feel like ongoing harm — because the environment continues to enact it.

Algorithmic Violence Ecology is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how harm can be produced and sustained by automated systems acting at scale, even when no human actor is choosing harm in the present tense.
