# 🏛 R.A.A.C. — Ruins and Architectural Committee  
**First created:** 2025-10-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*Minutes from the committee on collapse.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
A satirical and forensic study of how infrastructures fail in both material and meaning.  
Recasts **RAAC — Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete** — as the charter acronym for a fictional oversight body: the **Ruins and Architectural Committee**.  
Explores how modernity’s “lightweight” materials mirror its “lightweight” governance: short-term efficiency masking long-term disintegration.  
Part satire, part civic autopsy, part ethical planning document for the ruins of now.

## 🗂️ 1. Bureaucracy of Decay — The Paperwork of Crumbling  
Before the roof falls, there is always a memo.  
Minutes of deferred maintenance, cost-saving measures, structural risk assessments filed but unread.  
The Committee convenes too late — its members tasked with documenting collapse rather than preventing it.  
In the archive, every form is stamped *compliant at the time of inspection.*  
This is how modern ruin is made: not through disaster, but through **administrative drift**.

> “It was not negligence, merely procedure.”

## 🧱 2. Reinforced Ideology — Concrete as Cultural Logic  
RAAC was invented to be quick, cheap, and easy — the dream material of managerial modernity.  
It promised strength without weight, permanence without cost, and safety without oversight.  
Now it flakes in schools, hospitals, courts: our civic skeleton revealing its foam core.  
Every crack is a **philosophical failure**, an architectural echo of deregulation.  
The “reinforcement” was ideological: trust in paperwork, not in steel.

> The material was autoclaved; the ethics, not.

## 🚸 3. Glyphs of Governance — Road Signs, Fonts, and Safety Scripts  
Our cities speak in glyphs: *Give Way. Authorised Vehicles Only. Slow.*  
They are the runes of a managed people — prescriptive hieroglyphs of order and permission.  
As RAAC decays, the road markings fade too; the alphabet of control flakes with the concrete beneath.  
The Committee’s linguistics subcommittee proposes a new field: **Semiotic Structural Integrity** — the study of how instruction erodes.  
Every signpost that leans becomes a small act of civic poetry.

> When the symbol loses legibility, governance loses its voice.

## 🏗️ 4. Archaeology of the Present — Reading the City’s Autopsy  
We are not uncovering ruins; we are **living among them.**  
Car parks, shopping centres, municipal offices — all humming with the quiet fatigue of material overuse.  
The archaeologist of the present must read spreadsheets and planning permissions as stratigraphy.  
Our artefacts are insulation foam, CCTV housings, contractor badges.  
Each layer records a governance style — austerity, outsourcing, “value engineering”.  
To excavate a building’s failure is to excavate the logic that authorised it.

> The city’s bones are bureaucratic.

## 🪶 5. Charter for Future Ruins — Drafting the Committee’s Recommendations  
The Committee resolves:
1. **All architecture shall plan its own obituary.**  
   Each structure must include a *decommissioning ritual* — an acknowledgment of mortality.  
2. **Reinforcement shall include ethics.**  
   A building’s strength will be measured by the integrity of its accountability chain.  
3. **Public space shall be designed for re-occupation.**  
   Every derelict site must be acoustically and socially reusable.  
4. **Maintenance shall be memorial.**  
   Repair logs will be written as elegies, not invoices.  
5. **Collapse shall be documented as instruction.**  
   Future generations will learn from our failures — in tone, texture, and tensile strength.

> The Committee adjourns. The ceiling creaks. Minutes approved by gravity.

*🏛 R.A.A.C. — Ruins and Architectural Committee* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the administrative afterlife of modern infrastructure and the symbolic grammar of decay.
