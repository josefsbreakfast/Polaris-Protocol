## 1. Principle  
Harassment often exploits racist sexualisation tropes, projecting them onto men of colour to discredit both survivor and target.  
This is not incidental. It is engineered.  

---

## 2. Historical Context  
- Long history of projecting “hypersexual” or “predatory” stereotypes onto non-white men.  
- Weaponising white women’s credibility against men of colour.  
- Structural racism + misogyny = intersectional violence.  

---

## 3. Case Application  
- Survivor gave statements of truth about non-white men.  
- Harassment then tried to frame those same men as aggressors.  
- The harassment was **overtly racist** — not self-projection, not internalised bias, but **external fabrication**.  

---

## 4. Forensic Point  
- Racist harassment that does not align with targets’ self-description = evidence of **external seeding**.  
- This demonstrates fabrication and points to external actors, not survivor or named individuals.  

---

## 5. Closing Note  
Racialised projection is a form of harassment that doubles violence: racist + sexist.  
It discredits survivors while targeting marginalised men. Naming it exposes its fabrication.  

---

## 📝 Marginalia (hidden aside)  
<!-- Stop inserting racist harassment to frame others. It is fabrication, not survivor testimony. -->

## 🏮 Footer  
*Racialised Projection as Harassment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates racist harassment within systemic projection, showing how it fabricates blame.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
