# 🎶 Good Taste vs Surveillance Taste  
*When culture is recoded as compliance.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

“Good taste” used to mean discernment — an ability to hear something new and recognise beauty or honesty in it.  
In a datafied world, that same discernment can look *anomalous*.

Where the musicologist sees curiosity, the machine sees deviation.  
Where the listener feels nostalgia, the classifier reads regression.  
Where a human might hear survival, the risk model hears susceptibility.

The line between good taste and surveillance taste is drawn by **who gets to interpret the playlist**.

## 🎨 Cultural Curiosity vs Behavioural Profiling  

| Listener Intention | Surveillance Interpretation | Consequence |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| “I’m exploring a new scene” | “They’re shifting peer groups” | Social-mapping trigger |
| “This lyric captures my grief” | “Reinforcement of extremist ideology” | Channel/Prevent referral risk |
| “I like dark ambient to focus” | “Isolation or depressive markers” | Wellness intervention |
| “I’m learning Arabic / Urdu / Hebrew” | “Engagement with ideological content” | Automated language flag |

The same song can be **therapy or threat**, depending on the lens applied.  
Taste becomes *evidence* once your agency to interpret it is stripped away.

## 🎧 The Algorithmic Aesthetic  

Streaming platforms train us to treat our own taste as a **data reflection**, not an act of creation.  
Each “Wrapped” or “Replay” is both a mirror and a subtle containment loop — an annual reminder that our musical world is already being *curated back to us*.

When those same systems are folded into security or behavioural analytics, “good taste” becomes whatever aligns with normative emotional tone:  
- calm,  
- productive,  
- romantic,  
- uncontroversial.

Deviation reads as risk; passion reads as instability.  

The tragedy isn’t that the machines misread art — it’s that institutions start believing them.

## 🪞 What Consent Would Look Like  

If we were honest about experimentation, it could look like:  
- transparent research with **opt-in volunteers**,  
- clear boundaries between **cultural analytics** and **behavioural scoring**,  
- feedback loops that let participants *see and edit* their inferred profiles,  
- and recognition that **taste is selfhood**, not symptom.

The alternative — covert playlist steering — is the quiet theft of self-description.
