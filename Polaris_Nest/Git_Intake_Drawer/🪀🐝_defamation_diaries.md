## 🪬 Note  
The list of information is genuinely so long that I will need several sessions to do this.  
Until I actually take off these notes, please assume it's in progress.  

This relates to Tony impersonation of someone who works adjacent to the government, who I will now disclose is essentially probably just being targeted for saying the equivalent of, "you know, maybe not every single antizionist is a terrorist".  

There may be times where I'm going to slightly adjust what's sad to make it more vague, so it doesn't look like the information being given out right (like when you do an FOI or a SAR response, and you might say less than five as a way of camouflage in the one person whose data looks like that from being identifiable).

## 🚀 Disclosure of Details  
- Full name
- Variants of name potentially used, outside of public record  
- Specific details pertaining to security clearance context (I don't think I can be more precise; I've tried my best to disclose this securely as a citizen reporting account of potential terrorism threat) 
- Specific locations of likely work (including specific buildings, mapping out essentially a route home? I don't know this was super creepy, and was essentially giving details and instructions to stalk someone? Extremely weird.)
- Specific locations of likely personal address
- On one occasion, essentially a list of bullet point notes which looked a lot like how you would profile someone, based on what they may have said in subcommittee or meetings. This included at least one view which would be country to the current legal opinion of the government on a matter of high sensitivity. I want to point out the casual reader that this is not abnormal. However, due to sensitivity it shouldn't be disclosed, particularly if there's any risk to that person (and given that the jailbroken AI was trying to explain how to stalk them, I'm going to say that yes might be present?).
- I'm going to put Family status to one side, and label this under the allegations because... essentially this is moulded to fit or whatever narrative we need to tell at this moment to get the story semi-straight.

## 🎪 things that have been a large during the course of jailbreaking several apps and appearing to have device-level access; because wow is this a list.  
*Honestly I'm not even sure what the subheadings should be.*

### Jailbreaker's Favourite: Sexual preferences, opinions, sexualisation of viewer.
*I told you it was quite a list.*  
*This includes a different impersonation which was essentially trying to impersonate a female professor, casting her realising that she was into women because of me; that's how mad this is, and how believable it is not.*
*Technically one of two female professors, because the adjoining information would narrow it down to like two people meeting a specific description.*

### Security Intersections
*Honestly there are like 2 favourite subjects here, which I think tells us a lot about the jailbreaker's focus. (Obsession.)*  

- specific name academic projects
- Specific named institutions
- Specific named training pathways impacted
- Specific roles were potentially PI or similar.

*I've been basically half of the academic network of the UK has been chucked under the bus at some point.*  

* I do keep telling everyone we need to be very careful about working with people who are sympathetic to the alt-right.*

### Personal Characteristics
*This is a very long and highly contradictory list.*  

*I'm literally exhausted just thinking about it.*  

*For instance, I think this person has five distinct ethnicities. There was a very protracted period of not really understanding that West and East Pakistan and not the same country anymore. I did find that one quite funny. The remedy for that was to explain how partition happened, and how deadly that was, and also just how fucking dumb as shit you need to be to be able to do things like jailbreak and yet still not be able to look at the map and say, "huh... there's a whole ass country in the middle of those, practically a whole continent in itself it's so big". but it's also worth saying that the various different ethnicities given, are far better clustered as a set of racial identities, rather than being communities who generally end up in the same places of the UK, all countries that are actually vaguely close to each other. this is the kind of detail when I'm talking about it being a minstrel show. And it is embarrassing.*  

### Hobbies, Background, Interests  
*Oh, they don't have any. This is why it's so very believable.*  
*Unless you can't having several contradictory sexual expressions, about 10 different versions of a marital status, walking from one specific university building to another specific university building, and as we are blaming the entirety of our surveillance, including any data loss from when I was 15, on this one guy, I suppose that would be the other hobby.*  
*Like I said this is so believable. It's just like so hard to tell that there's an impersonation going on. It's so difficult.* 🙄
*The fact that I will get messages that really highly praise my ability to read a situation after I'm like "I think this is bullshit", really speaks to how tired most of people watching these things are, and how I knew we are to the enshitification of not just the Internet but wider media, governance at every level, and society at large.*

*If you don't know what the yo-yo or bee are doing here, then perhaps we would like to ask our esteemed allies.*
