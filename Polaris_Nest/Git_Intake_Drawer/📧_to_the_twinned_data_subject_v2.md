I'm sorry that v1 was published, but I had to test what my feed did with it.

I needed to know how much was still active institutional manipulation, and not any other means.

I was slso quite cross about the number of adverts for a lifetime supply of toilet roll I was getting, and how many of the same women had turned up on my feed selling me 3 of the same Â£3 chunk of metal.

My lovely cousins may have decided to lay low since a recent post, so a helpful checkpoint.

I'm not apologising for the content of my opinions; I dont feel I was entirely incorrect. You'll survive.
