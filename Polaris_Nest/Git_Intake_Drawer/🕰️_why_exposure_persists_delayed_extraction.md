**First created:** 2025-10-13  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-13  
*Explains why live probes and vulnerable witnesses often remain exposed long after the data is sufficient.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Even with consensus to remove someone from an unsafe digital environment, extraction is often delayed. This node documents the systemic reasons and fixes.

## 🧩 Core Causes  
| Category | Description | Symptom |
|---|---|---|
| Fragmented ownership | No single body has full authority | Weeks of “not our remit” |
| Evidence‑vs‑care gridlock | “One more trace” resets the clock | Endless extensions |
| Legal hesitation | Fear acting without explicit cover | “Awaiting legal” purgatory |
| Resource gaps | No housing/escort/clinicians ready | Delay until logistics align |
| Sunk‑cost bias | Effort already invested | Rationalised continuation |
| No hard‑stops | Lacking timers and renewals | Drift past ethical limits |
| Political optics | Extraction signals failure | Quiet continuation |

## 🧭 Corrective Design  
Single command owner; explicit 72h default limit with oversight renewal; duty‑of‑care clause; pre‑funded extraction capacity; automatic review clock; transparent audit; independent clinician veto.
