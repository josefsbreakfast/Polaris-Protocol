## **Description**
"Procedural Wait Your Turn" is a containment narrative that reframes suppression as neutral governance.  
It presents deliberate delay as an acceptable and necessary process step, even when the underlying context is urgent or harmful.

---

## **Observed Functions**
1. **Legitimising stall tactics** â€“ Framed as adherence to procedure, masking the engineered nature of the delay.  
2. **Reframing suppression as governance** â€“ Suggests that slowing you down is part of a neutral, rules-based process.  
3. **Psychological containment** â€“ Cools urgency by implying you are already 'in the queue'.  
4. **Moral laundering** â€“ Bureaucratic language softens the optics of obstruction.

## **Deployment Context**
- Most often appears when the institution expects eventual disclosure will be unavoidable, but needs time to align internal narratives and reduce reputational/legal risk.
- Used alongside hard containment tactics (platform throttling, network choke points) to create an illusion of progress.

---

## **Example Phraseology**
- "This is procedural; please wait your turn."
- "These things take time."
- "We must follow the process before taking further action."

---

## **Forensic Indicators**
- Coincides with sudden escalation in strategic observers or compliance officers viewing case material.  
- Paired with engagement locks or analytics freezes in public-facing channels.  
- Often follows a triggering action that links multiple jurisdictional risks (e.g., SAR + FOIA + NGO exposure).

## **Polaris Response Protocol**
1. **Log deployment** with timestamp and environment context.
2. **Cross-reference** with concurrent containment actions to establish coordination.
3. **Publicly reframe** the phrase to expose its suppressive function when safe to do so.
4. **Pressure the timeline** â€“ use statutory deadlines (GDPR, FOIA) to override open-ended procedural stalling.
