checked mysteriously vanishing book.  

background: impossible to find and keyword match, seo so shite it looked like it had been kgb botted. huge surveillance interference to order. kept going out of stock almost immediatdly if put in amazon basket. when ordered from pub, spoof alerts everywhere.  

book has not mysteriously reappeared and has stock (just!).  

book and author up on google trends from zilch.  

can't decide if i am a genius or have magical powers; either/both is good.  

(or: potentially a pre-action warning is pretty effective. i like the version of events where i am a wizard.)
