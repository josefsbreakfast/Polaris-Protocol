🔮 Authoritarian Recurrence Cluster Index

First created: 2025-10-08 | Last updated: 2025-10-08
A constellation of nodes examining how fascism and authoritarianism re-emerge through economic stress, digital amplification, and scapegoat politics — and how they are resisted.

🌌 Overview

The cluster traces repeating civilisational dynamics: fear → scapegoating → normalisation → violence → resistance.
It draws on comparative history, theology, media studies, and survivor-voice fidelity to map early-stage atrocity risk and civic countermeasures.
All nodes link laterally; none depend on reading order.

🧭 1 Early-Stage Atrocity Physics

Scope: macro-analysis of economic inequality, online mobilisation, and scapegoat revival.
Use: establishes baseline framework and warning indicators.

📡 2 Algorithmic Statecraft — Digital Propaganda as Distributed Authoritarianism

Scope: how algorithmic virality replicates centralised propaganda.
Cross-links: Coercive Engineers (13); HM Dept Coercive Nudges.

🕯️ 3 Britain’s Near-Miss with Fascism — The Cable Street Precedent

Scope: domestic fascism 1930s; immigrant-led resistance; debunking British exceptionalism.
Cross-links: Raw Materials of Fascism; When Authoritarianism and Genocide Are Resisted.

🧠 4 Linguistic Drift of Scapegoating — From “Coloured” to “Woke”

Scope: evolution of exclusionary language 1970s→present.
Cross-links: Manufacturing the Scapegoat (11); Diffuse Architecture (5).

🕯️ 5 Diffuse Architecture of Persecution

Scope: intersectional mapping of targets (queer, disabled, Roma, Jewish etc.); links between Nazi and modern multi-target hate.
Cross-links: Raw Materials (6); Justice Angels and Adversaries (10).

⚙️ 6 Raw Materials of Fascism

Scope: economic humiliation + fear + family moral panic as structural inputs.
Cross-links: Manufacturing the Scapegoat (11); Coercive Engineers (13).

🧨 7 Manufacturing the Scapegoat — How Prejudice Becomes Political Technology

Scope: transformation of latent bias into ideology; Nazi model vs current Islamophobia.
Cross-links: Linguistic Drift (4); Raw Materials (6).

📖 8 Justice, Angels and Adversaries — Comparative Theology and Law

Scope: evolution of evil (Iblīs/Satan/ha-Satan) and its reflection in Halakha, Canon Law, and Sharia; debunking “Islam as anti-feminist/anti-gay.”
Cross-links: Early-Stage Atrocity Physics (1); Human Principles.

🌤️ 9 When Authoritarianism and Genocide Are Resisted

Scope: global compendium of successful resistance to fascism and mass violence.
Cross-links: Britain’s Near-Miss (3); Preventive Framework (10).

📜 10 Preventive Framework — UN Atrocity Indicators Applied to the UK Context

Scope: converts UN & Stanton criteria into a UK-specific early-warning checklist.
Cross-links: Early-Stage Atrocity Physics (1); System Governance.

🪞 11 Author’s Notebook — Reflections from a Jewish Witness to Modern Scapegoating

Scope: personal essay on survivor memory, allyship, and ethical witnessing.
Cross-links: Diffuse Architecture (5); Raw Materials (6).

🎛 12 Coercive Engineers — Intentional Radicalisation and the Normality Trap

Scope: identifies deliberate actors who engineer polarisation; includes academic diagnostic frameworks (Paxton, Eco, Payne, Britt).
Cross-links: Algorithmic Statecraft (2); Manufacturing the Scapegoat (7); Preventive Framework (10).

🔮 13 Atrocity-Recurrence Index (Map)

Scope: visual and textual cross-reference map for the entire cluster; links out to Genocide by Containment, Suppression as Signal, and Human Principles / Ethics Frames.
