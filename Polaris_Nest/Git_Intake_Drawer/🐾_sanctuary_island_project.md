# 🐾 Sanctuary Island Project  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*Non-verbal co-regulation between rescued animals and humans in recovery.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
A small, accessible island sanctuary where traumatised animals and humans share space, care routines, and quiet.  
It’s not therapy and not rescue in the traditional sense — it’s a refusal of the industrialised pace that broke both species.  
The aim is *slow repair through shared presence*: animals heal from fear, humans rediscover gentleness and belonging.

## 🧩 Core Model  

### 🐈 Animal Cohort  
- Long-stay or permanent residents: cats, dogs, small livestock, rescue horses.  
- Focus on behavioural rehabilitation, consistency, and safety.  
- No “adopt-out churn” — animals are family, not stock.  

### 👩‍🌾 Human Cohort  
- Short-stay or visiting participants: survivors of burnout, trauma, chronic illness, or disability.  
- Structure: daily feeding, grooming, gardening, routine tasks; no forced conversation.  
- Boundaries built around choice, quiet, and interspecies trust.  

### 🛖 Infrastructure  
- Adapted, accessible farmstead or island base (ramps, trolleys, modular fencing).  
- Volunteer network for heavy labour and remote administration.  
- Energy systems designed for low noise: solar, wind, battery storage.  
- Digital intake and welfare logging for both human and animal residents.  

### 🌱 Guiding Principles  
- **Co-regulation**: emotional steadiness through shared rhythm.  
- **Accessibility by design**: sanctuary must serve disabled caregivers first.  
- **Transparency**: full open-data model for welfare and operations.  
- **Slowness as safety**: nothing rushed, no growth beyond capacity.

## 💡 Development Path  
1. **Pilot phase** – mainland foster network + small rented smallholding (proof of concept).  
2. **Acquisition** – secure long-lease or freehold island (5–20 acres, accessible).  
3. **Infrastructure build** – modular barns, quiet shelters, hydroponic garden pods.  
4. **Opening cycle** – 3–6-month rolling residency for humans, lifelong residency for animals.  
5. **Public education** – open days, digital storytelling, citizen-rehab research node.

*🐾 Sanctuary Island Project* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It sketches a model for slow, interspecies repair — a sanctuary for beings whose nervous systems have been frayed by modernity.
