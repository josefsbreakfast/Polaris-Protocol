# 🩸 Mimicry of Blood Libel  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How Western leaders reproduce the blood libel by framing Israeli state violence as “Judaism”.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node argues that when Western leaders describe Israeli torture, desecration, or apartheid as “just Judaism” or “Jewish security needs,” they engage in a **modernised blood libel** — one disguised as political solidarity.  
The original blood libel accused Jews of intrinsic cruelty. Today’s version does the same, but through **colonial mimicry**: projecting state violence onto Jewish faith.

## 🧩 Structural Outline  

### 1. Historical Blood Libel (Norwich 1144 → modernity)  
- Jews framed as vengeful, bloodthirsty  
- Jewish ritual presented as inherently cruel  
- Mechanism: collapse of religion into caricature

### 2. Contemporary Mimicry  
- Western leaders treating Israeli violence as cultural essence  
- “This is what Jews do” → same logic, modern setting  
- Antisemitism masquerading as alliance

### 3. Projective Colonialism  
- Empire reassigns its own cruelty onto minority subjects  
- “Support” becomes a vehicle for racial myth  
- Shielding itself from accountability by making Jews symbolic perpetrators

### 4. Political Consequences  
- Judaism equated with brutality  
- Jewish communities endangered  
- Silence on Palestinian torture framed as Jewish loyalty test

### 5. Repair  
- Restoring the distinction between **state** and **people**  
- Reasserting halakhic + ethical frameworks (Torah, Kabbalah)  
- Returning moral custody of Jewish ethics to Jewish communities
