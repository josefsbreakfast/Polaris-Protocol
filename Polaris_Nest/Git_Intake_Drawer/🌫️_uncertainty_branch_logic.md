# 🌫️ Uncertainty Branch Logic  
**First created:** 2025-11-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-05  
*Designing structural humility into decision trees.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Outlines how automated systems can embed *epistemic humility* as a structural move.  
An “uncertainty branch” ensures that when harm is uncertain and stakes are irreversible, the system stops, escalates, or refuses instead of optimising forward.

## 🧩 Planned Sections  
- Definition of epistemic uncertainty  
- Risk thresholds and harm magnitudes  
- Escalation architecture (STOP / ESCALATE / FLAG)  
- Rewarding refusal  
- Integration with accountability logic
