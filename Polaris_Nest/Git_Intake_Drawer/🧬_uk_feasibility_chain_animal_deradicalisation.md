# 🧬 UK Feasibility Chain for Animal-Assisted Deradicalisation  
**First created:** 2025-11-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*A systems-governance analysis of how animal-assisted stabilisation could be (mis)perceived as “deradicalisation” in the UK — and the narrow, health-led feasibility chain in which such work can legitimately occur.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node clarifies **how animal-assisted interventions ever end up adjacent to radicalisation vulnerability cases**, why people sometimes misinterpret them as “CT interventions,” and what the *actual* UK feasibility chain looks like.

This is not deradicalisation.  
This is not Prevent.  
This is not security work.  

It is a **niche therapeutic stabilisation pathway** that sometimes sits adjacent to young people flagged for *safeguarding reasons* — not for CT operations.

This node maps exactly how such an intervention might be constructed, governed, authorised, and misread.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Sets out the *only* lawful UK pathways where AAI appears near VE risk  
- Distinguishes clinical stabilisation work from CT interventions  
- Explains “misperception pathways” where AAT feels like security activity  
- Lays out a step-by-step feasibility chain  
- Provides structural clarity for later Polaris diagnostic work

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

## 1. Core Principle: There Is **No** UK CT Mandate for AAT  
There is no statutory, operational, or policy framework in which UK counter‑terrorism, Prevent, or policing bodies can:

- authorise  
- design  
- supervise  
- or deliver  

animal-assisted stabilisation or operant conditioning with a person’s pet.

The practice sits exclusively in:  
- NHS trauma services  
- CAMHS  
- attachment/behavioural research  
- AAT-certified clinician work  

The feasibility chain begins and ends in **healthcare and academia**.

---

## 2. Why AAT Appears Near Vulnerability-to-Extremism (VE) Work  
The VE framework is fundamentally a **vulnerability lens**.

Young people flagged here often present with:  
- trauma  
- isolation  
- anxiety  
- attachment disruption  
- emotional dysregulation  
- distress behaviours  
- social withdrawal  

AAT aligns with:  
- emotional regulation  
- nervous system stabilisation  
- predictable comfort  
- grounding cycles  
- attachment repair  

Thus, AAT may be used **alongside** VE safeguarding work, but **never as CT strategy**.

---

## 3. Misperception Pathways: How AAT Gets Misread as CT  
AAT can be mistaken for a CT-linked intervention when:

### a) **Multiple services are involved simultaneously**  
Health, education, and social care involvement can feel like “security.”

### b) **Safeguarding vocabulary overlaps with CT language**  
Terms like “risk,” “concern,” and “vulnerability” sound similar across systems.

### c) **People are not told who is doing what**  
Silence + absence of clarity = narrative distortion.

### d) **Animal behaviour change is interpreted as external manipulation**  
Operant conditioning routines (clickers, comfort prompts) can be misunderstood.

These misperceptions arise from **poor inter-agency communication**, not actual CT practice.

## 4. The UK Feasibility Chain (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1 — A young person presents with distress / trauma**  
This may be noticed by:  
- school/college  
- GP  
- CAMHS  
- youth worker  
- safeguarding lead

### **Step 2 — Emotional regulation difficulties are identified**  
Indicators include:  
- panic  
- dissociation  
- withdrawal  
- agitation  
- difficulty trusting services  

### **Step 3 — Referral to trauma-informed services**  
This may involve:  
- CAMHS  
- local NHS trauma team  
- third-sector youth trauma organisation  
- university-led therapeutic research

### **Step 4 — AAT is considered as adjunct therapy**  
Only if:  
- consent is obtained  
- an AAT-trained clinician is available  
- animal welfare requirements are met  
- clinical governance agrees

### **Step 5 — Operant conditioning is used for predictable comfort**  
Examples:  
- routine-based pet interactions  
- clicker training to reduce anxiety  
- grounding through animal contact  
- structured co-regulation work  

This helps stabilise the young person — not “deradicalise” them.

### **Step 6 — VE vulnerability may be assessed in parallel**  
Safeguarding professionals may also be asking:  
- “Is this young person isolated?”  
- “Are there exploitation risks?”  
- “Is there online influence?”  

This **adjacency** can create misinterpretations.

### **Step 7 — Services operate independently but concurrently**  
AAT runs under health governance; VE assessment under safeguarding.  
They do not inform each other except through standard safeguarding lines.

## 5. What This Feasibility Chain *Cannot* Produce  
It cannot produce:  
- covert conditioning  
- police‑directed AAT sessions  
- CT actors entering a home to interact with a pet  
- secret influence operations using animals  
- “behavioural engineering” outside a clinical frame  

If any of this occurs, it is **not** AAT, nor lawful, nor legitimate.

---

## 6. What the Feasibility Chain *Does* Produce  
It can produce:  
- the appearance of a complex multi-agency support structure  
- confusion about who authorised what  
- therapeutic interventions adjacent to VE assessment  
- moments where comfort‑oriented animal interactions look vaguely “structured”  
- mistaken attribution to CT bodies who were never present

This node exists to untangle that confusion.

*UK Feasibility Chain for Animal-Assisted Deradicalisation* maps the only lawful pathways through which therapeutic animal-assisted stabilisation might appear near VE vulnerability cases.  
It clarifies adjacency without endorsing any CT interpretation.
