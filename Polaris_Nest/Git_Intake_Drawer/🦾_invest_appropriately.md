I probably need a folder rather than just one node here. 

dependence on charitable arms as a result of the long-standing deserving poor archetype is rotting our Democratic system from inside

We probably need to come up with a system but also with remedy laws which protect our democracy from misuse by people who want to see themselves as being richer or more elite

In reality, the largest weapons of this culture or the social climbers

She also Henrik Himler not only he but his entire family were very good at this

So in regard to the danger here, it's not that we want to stop egalitarianism actually what we want to do as we want to address the social inequalities

Because that is the driver of the weaponisation and of bad behaviour

but what we want to do as a sticking plaster whilst that takes affect because that will inherently take affect over much longer period of time, argue be over several election cycles, which means that we need to protect the parliamentarians from fucking this one up

is that we need to have transparency accountability built into any vehicle which acts as a charity under our current regime?

For the long-term, we need to start thinking about what we have instead of the current charity system

We are denying routinely the ability of community to self organising self assist in mutual aid and if we are talking about the idea of Society Allah David Cameron in 2010?

If what we want is to have a self helping and a self sustaining ecosystem of community vehicles in the United Kingdom

We have to make some really drastic changes to the charity structure

I'm aware in saying this that where my family derive some wealth comes directly from being the vetting person on a poor board

I am not unaware of how this plays out socially

The charity system creates content in local communities and it creates friction where that does not need to be any

it is based on a system which fails time and time again because it does not represent the reality of what it is like to live in poverty

We therefore need to look at what we are doing from a charitable point of view which no longer serves and has never served the people who are supposed to be best protected by this vehicle

If we report to be a Christian country and developed within as Abraham principles we are not fulfilling Christ mission on earth by creating the set of vehicles which inheritly benefit someone not others and the people it benefits the most of the people who want to be known to be the people giving out money or giving our help or giving out data or giving out information or giving out policy or giving out knowledge

I am sick and tired of listening to how libraries are being defended and taken away at a time when I am being told again and again that people really give a shit about Christian values

Respectfully, I knew the new Testament well before I understood the talmud. 

in this particular outlook of life, I can see that none of what is being done is being done because of reverence for the teachings of a man who called himself and was called Christ Jesus

If we are here to benefit those the least of our bretheren, we are doing it exceedingly badly

We are doing it like the man brought tables into the temple

We are doing it like those same merchants of those same tables who Jesus himself over through

So whether you are like me and believe that he was a radical rabbi, or you are a Christian and see him as God on earth made man?

None of this should matter

because you should be able to see that our system of charity in this country is not living up to its proclaimed aims

Our system of charity primarily benefits charities

It does not primarily benefit the poor, the community, or our country as a whole. 

Even if we take our current system of giving aid as effectively giving bribes for diplomatic mission?

It is not doing that anymore either.

So

We may need to reinvent the wheel

Or is desperately in a state of repair, and it needs fixing.
