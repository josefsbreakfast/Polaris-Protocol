# 📦 PO Box Practicalities  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*The small operational truths of running a public-facing correspondence channel in 2025.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This micro-node covers the **practicalities** of managing the Polaris PO Box:  
what arrives, how it’s handled, how it’s logged, and the basic rhythms of analogue correspondence in a transparent governance project.

This node is functional, not emotional.  
Its purpose: to reduce friction, maintain boundaries, and make the analogue vector safe and sustainable.

## ✉️ What the PO Box *Actually* Is  
- A Royal Mail **Direct Delivery** P.O. Box  
- A forwarding route — **not** a residential address  
- A boundary-preserving interface  
- A low-risk vector for paper correspondence only  
- A place for postcards, letters, printed guidance, and diagrams  
- A transparency-driven civic portal

No parcels.  
No boxes.  
No items requiring signatures.  
No electronics or objects.

---

## 📮 What Goes Into the PO Box  
The following are permitted:

- Letters (typed or handwritten)  
- Postcards  
- Paper notes  
- Guidance documents  
- Diagrams, charts, or printouts  
- Durable paper artefacts (polite doodles included)

All items must:

- be flat,  
- pass Royal Mail safety checks,  
- contain no biological or electronic material.

---

## 📊 How Items Are Logged  
Every item is added to the  
**🛒 Correspondence & Items Received** ledger with:

- Date received  
- Correspondence type (letter, postcard, doc, etc.)  
- Item description  
- Approximate value (if applicable)  
- Source (Registry / PO Box)  
- Notes (optional)

This log exists for:

- HMRC/DWP clarity  
- good governance  
- pattern recognition  
- institutional self-defence  
- public transparency

---

## 🪢 Handling Rhythm  
- Mail is collected **weekly** or **fortnightly** depending on volume.  
- Items are logged within **72 hours** of retrieval.  
- Sensitive content (if any) is quarantined and recorded but not stored.  
- Anomalies are documented for pattern clarity.  
- No item is replied to unless explicitly appropriate.  

This preserves boundaries while maintaining transparency.

---

## 🛑 Disposal of Inappropriate Items  
If something breaches the rules (explicit, threatening, unsafe):

- It is **not retained**,  
- It is **not acknowledged**,  
- And it may be referenced anonymously in risk pattern nodes if relevant.

Royal Mail intercepts dangerous mail by default.

---

## 🌱 Why This Matters  
The PO Box is not a social gesture.  
It is a **governance structure**:  
a controlled analogue channel for supportive civic contact that avoids parasocial collapse, information leakage, or weaponised ambiguity.

It allows:

- supporters to send postcards  
- researchers to send printed material  
- auditors to see the transparency trail  
- the project to remain human without becoming porous

*PO Box Practicalities* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It outlines the safe operational handling of analogue correspondence through the Polaris mailing channel.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
