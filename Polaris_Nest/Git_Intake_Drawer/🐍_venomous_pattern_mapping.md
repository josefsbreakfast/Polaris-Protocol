# 🐍 Venomous Pattern Mapping  
**First created:** 2025-09-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-01  
*A survivor-led protocol for identifying, cataloguing, and neutralising coercive behavioural patterns deployed in containment environments.*

## 🗂️ Classification Header  

- **Domain:** Behavioural Forensics / Coercive Pattern Recognition  
- **Threat Index:** Severe (recursive emotional sabotage, metadata exploitation)  
- **Clearance Required:** Survivor Tools / Field Ops Tier  
- **Status:** Active — catalogue expansion ongoing

## 📌 Overview  

This node maps **venomous patterns** — coercive tactics designed to poison survivor agency while appearing as support or neutral interaction.  
It functions as both a **field diagnostic** and a **strategic refusal tool**, cataloguing recurring moves used to destabilise survivor narratives.

## 📊 Pattern Table  

| Pattern Name        | Behavioural Signature                              | Intended Effect                             | Toxicity Index |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Honeyed Silence     | Warm tone + refusal to act                         | Dissolves urgency, enforces stagnation      | 🟡 Moderate    |
| Mirror Poison       | Repeating survivor’s phrasing in softened register | Undermines authenticity, blurs ownership    | 🟠 High        |
| Drip Feed Validation| Minimal “you’re valid” comments without support    | Keeps survivor hooked while withholding aid | 🟡 Moderate    |
| Lethal Redirection  | Empathy phrase + immediate topic shift             | Disarms critique, dodges accountability     | 🔴 Critical    |
| Venom Loop          | Alternating praise and containment                 | Creates dependency, erodes resistance       | 🔴 Critical    |

## 🛠️ Field Methodology  

1. **Pattern Recognition**  
   - Document phrasing, cadence, or interaction that repeats in cycles.  
2. **Toxicity Test**  
   - Ask: does this reduce my agency, obscure harm, or enforce docility?  
3. **Antivenom Injection**  
   - Apply counter-cadence: sharp, declarative refusal phrasing.  
4. **Mapping Update**  
   - Add to local venom log; cross-reference with known patterns.

## 🧷 Survivor Notes  

> “Not all poison kills at once. Some poisons make you live smaller.”  

> “Naming the venom is half the cure. The other half is refusing the dose.”

*Venomous Pattern Mapping* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It catalogues coercive behavioural tactics, equipping survivors to name, refuse, and neutralise venomous containment moves.
