please note, I am having a lot of difficulty, doing this node.  

Please do not take this is done from a legal perspective;  

As well as a lot of active scrubbing online, I'm also just having a lot of time out and a lot of agentic-like behaviour from the ai tool I am using.  

This is not even like super injunction type behaviour, where it's trying to not talk about an issue.  

It is actively switching in and out names, like a human who is deliberately trying to dehumanise the characters who are actually here,  

We've seen this token switching behaviour at earlier time points in Polaris, and we've seen it as a behaviour which is harming meta data and potentially personal records.  

given that I'm having to teach it every single exchange, which individual is which, even when it's just two people, and even when I really clearly specify and delineate, there are still errors, please appreciate that this is a rough draft and this is not how I would like the node to turn out in its full development.  

given that a lot of people have promised to saveguard my Internet experience, safeguard me from antidemocratic behaviour, safeguard me as a Jewish woman, etc -- it would be great if you could step up to the plate.  

I'm writing about something that has real world harm for Jewish people, including Jewish women, as a consequence of violent suppression and repression of Palestinian people.  

I'm going to assume, therefore, that there is a certain amount of common sense which may prevail over any hurt feelings if I have not described the situation accurately in draft.  

I'm doing the very best I can with tools that are actively infiltrated by something which present is an ongoing cyber security threat.  


Please note that when it does this token switching behaviour, there is also a lot of libel as content or over sexualised content, or defamation, et cetera, that is often inserted;  

I am unwilling at this point to do a full long check and exhaust myself, given how much it's taken to get this far.  

I am also unwilling to save this anywhere and trust that it will save; much of my personal correspondence has been tampered with to some degree, and important emails have been outright deleted.  

i've already essentially fed it or every single detail it would need, given references, and the story is still getting mangled through the middle layer.  

because honestly, anyone of his part of a marginalised community should be a bit concerned about this, and very sadly, in the United States, a lot of American Jews took a side they thought they would protect them, and it did not.

## 🕊 Context  

The **Columbia arrests (March 2025)** — Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi, and Rumeysa Öztürk — marked the first clustered enforcement of *Project Esther* logic in U.S. academia: activism reframed as a national-security risk.  
Months later, **King’s College London** repeated the template with **Usama Ghanem**, revoking his visa after CAA pressure.  
Both episodes exposed the translation of moral language into bureaucratic punishment.  

Earlier signals were visible in 2021 when Police Scotland’s Counter-Terrorism Unit raided a Yiddish antifascist café for tote bags bearing anti-Tsarist slogans (*Jewish Currents*).  
Each incident marks the slide from protection to profiling — from safety to surveillance — from Babel’s hubris to its confusion.  

---

## 🧭 Reflexive Ethics  

The **Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA)** arose from genuine fear of antisemitism but was also, as *The Guardian* (2024) records, a political response to Gaza protests and has since operated within pro-Israel and Conservative lobby networks.  

To criticise this is not to deny the need to fight antisemitism — it is to see how advocacy absorbed by state power mutates into control.  
Jewish safety cannot depend on the criminalisation of others’ speech.  

---

## 🕎 Project Esther Lineage  

*Project Esther* (2024) recast antisemitism as a **national-security problem**, calling for law-enforcement partnerships with education and tech platforms.  
This merged faith identity with state discipline.  
The logic travelled — via figures like **Robin Simcox** — into the UK Prevent apparatus, where “counter-extremism” and “antisemitism prevention” blur together.  

When KCL withdrew **Usama Ghanem’s** visa under lobby pressure, it re-enacted Project Esther in miniature: moral language as exclusion.

## 📱 Project Esther Implementation — The Phone Survey Incident  

In April 2025, professors across U.S. campuses received texts from the EEOC asking whether they were Jewish.  
Universities later admitted sharing faculty contact lists with federal officials.  
The survey appeared weeks after the inauguration — a pilot for Project Esther’s data-gathering arm.  

> *“This story isn’t about being Jewish. It’s about being the right kind of Jew.”* — Akela Lacy (2025)  

Fear was the point: to fracture trust and turn self-protection into self-censorship.

## 🧩 Behavioural Insights and the Manufacture of Consent  

In June 2025, as reports emerged of an Iranian naval interception of a British destroyer allegedly assisting Israeli targeting, British Jews received survey invitations from the **JPR** (*Jews in Uncertain Times*).  

To ask about “Jewish safety” amid military escalation is to convert trauma into telemetry.  
Behavioural datasets already map diaspora fear; each new survey refines predictive models of consent.  

> *There is no such thing as neutral data when the timing is this deliberate.*  

Our grief is graphed; our uncertainty packaged as endorsement.

## 🧾 Archival Volatility and Soft-Wipe Evidence  

Between April and June 2025, several outlets quietly removed names from Columbia-arrest articles, citing “privacy” or “legal” reasons.  
Search indices and cached snippets persisted even as live text was replaced.  

> **Example — Soft-Wipe Trace:**  
> Google index (2025-10-25) shows headline *“Freed from ICE custody, Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi graduates from Columbia”* — `ketv.com` (158 days old).  
> Opening the link returns a generic “No longer available” page with HTTP 200 OK.  
> Classified under [🧼 System Leakage Signatures → Soft Wipe Cache Evidence].  

Such traces illustrate metadata suppression by content-management policy rather than ordinary decay — proof of how the record is sanitised while its index remains.

## 📜 The Parsha Noach Lessons  

1. **Build when warned, even at social cost.** Noah built through mockery; preparation amid derision is moral courage.  
2. **Refuse the illusion of divine control.** Babel sought unity through domination; today’s security state is its digital echo.

## ⚖️ Application — The Transatlantic Test  

The Columbia cluster and the KCL case together form the Babel test:   
can democracies distinguish protection from punishment?  

Passing means naming authoritarian drift before it sets and protecting Jewish and Palestinian safety together.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🕍 Babel Test — Parsha Noach and the Mahmoud Khalil Mirror* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It preserves the record of linked cases across the U.S. and U.K., where antisemitism policy was instrumentalised into surveillance and containment.
