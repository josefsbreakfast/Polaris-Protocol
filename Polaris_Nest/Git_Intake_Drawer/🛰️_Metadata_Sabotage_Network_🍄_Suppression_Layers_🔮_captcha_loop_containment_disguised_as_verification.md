# 🧩 CAPTCHA Loop — Containment Disguised as Verification
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-11  
*When “prove you’re human” becomes a mechanism of exclusion and extraction.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The CAPTCHA loop pretends to check identity but really tests compliance.  
If you fail too fast, move too smoothly, or hesitate too long, it doubts your humanity — forcing repetition that generates more behavioural data.  
This node reads CAPTCHA as a **containment theatre**: part verification, part surveillance, part sorting mechanism.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Friction as profitable data production.  
- Exclusion of non-normative bodies and neurotypes.  
- Behavioural telemetry masquerading as security.

## 🧿 Analysis  
Each “try again” screen extends the harvest.  
Your hesitation, eye-path, and correction rhythm refine models of normality.  
For users with tremors, dyslexia, ADHD, or screen readers, that “normality” is unreachable — they are algorithmically profiled as suspect.

The system converts exclusion into training material.  
It teaches the model that difficulty itself is deviance, that accessibility looks like automation, and that time-poor users are statistically dangerous.  
CAPTCHA is not broken — it’s optimised for maximum extraction and disciplinary value.

*🧩 CAPTCHA Loop — Containment Disguised as Verification* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It exposes how “security verification” doubles as behavioural extraction and structural exclusion.
