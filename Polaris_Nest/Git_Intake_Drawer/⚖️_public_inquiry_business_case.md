# ⚖️ Public Inquiry Business Case — Evidential Integrity and Data-Twin Exploitation  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Sets out why a formal inquiry is required into weak digital provenance, manufactured timelines, and their exploitation, including overlap with security contexts such as Operation Iron Swords.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Weak digital signals (single Wi-Fi associations, one-off emails/SMS, event registrations) have been aggregated into apparent proof. This has enabled false harassment complaints, clearance/disciplinary actions, and systemic targeting of key professional groups. The pattern is exploitable by hostile actors and has likely overlapped with contested information environments during Operation Iron Swords and after. This node frames the case for a parliamentary inquiry, balancing public transparency with security-sensitive closed modules.

---

## 📍 Why This Needs an Inquiry  
- **Security risk is ongoing.** The apparatus remains exploitable, especially under contested information conditions.  
- **Cluster impact on democracy.** Harms fall heavily on registered professions, security-cleared staff, academics, and whistleblowers.  
- **Affordability.** Estimated 1k–3k direct victims, tens of thousands indirectly. Redress in the £0.1–0.7bn range is realistic compared with other schemes.  
- **Multiple sources of harm.** Some malicious, some careless, some corporate — but cumulative damage is serious.  
- **Peace and repair.** Acknowledgement and structured redress lets affected individuals give evidence, find closure, and rebuild trust.

## 📍 Scope of Inquiry (proposed TOR)  
1. Map where weak digital signals were used as material evidence in decisions (2012–present).  
2. Review vendor contracts and preservation/export practices.  
3. Audit FOI/SAR handling, especially patterns of diversion or refusal.  
4. Examine how hostile or opportunistic actors exploited these weaknesses during/after Operation Iron Swords.  
5. Recommend evidentiary standards (multi-signal gates), procurement obligations, and preservation duties.  
6. Propose hybrid redress (banded awards + assessed damages for catastrophic harms).  

---

## 📍 Inquiry Model  
- **Public module:** evidential standards, procurement, FOI/SAR, redress framework.  
- **Closed module:** security-sensitive cases, classified vendor data, foreign exploitation, individual testimonies requiring privacy.  
- **Duration:** 6 months (interim at 3 months).  

---

## 📍 Expected Outcomes  
- **System hardening:** multi-signal evidentiary gates; chain-of-custody rules.  
- **Procurement reform:** vendor preservation SLAs, export standards, immutable admin logs.  
- **FOI uplift:** statutory preservation duty, refusal analytics.  
- **Redress:** hybrid model, vendor recoveries, capped admin costs.  
- **Public reassurance:** acknowledgement of harm, proactive outreach to victims, ability to make peace.  

---

## 📍 Ethical Posture  
- Avoid scapegoating; recognise multiple actors with different motives.  
- Victim-first, trauma-informed, privacy-respecting processes.  
- Balance transparency with necessary confidentiality (semi-closed hearings where required).
