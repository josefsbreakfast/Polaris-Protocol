# ☕ The Auntie Model of Memetic Transmission — Indigenous Analytics of Stickiness  
**First created:** 2025-10-23  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*Everything Silicon Valley learned about virality, the aunties already knew.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Treats the archetypal “three aunties” of collective storytelling as living laboratories of memetic theory.  
In every culture they occupy the informal command centre of attention economics: experts in tone, timing, and trust.  
Their kitchen-table information networks demonstrate what algorithmic modellers miss—**stickiness is social choreography, not math.**

## ☕ 1.  The Auntie Algorithm  
The auntie circle runs on four core variables:  

| Variable | Description | Tech Equivalent |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Relevance** | “Is it our business?”  Filters content to shared social graph. | Recommendation weight |
| **Relatability** | “Could this be me?”  Embeds empathy payload. | Personalisation score |
| **Retell Value** | “How good will it sound later?”  Optimises phrasing for reuse. | Compression / memeability |
| **Timing** | “When’s tea served?”  Releases story at peak receptivity. | Push-notification scheduling |

They don’t collect data; they *sense mood*.  Calibration happens through laughter volume and eyebrow lift.

## 🧩 2.  Gossip as Quality Control  
Auntie networks operate as moral QA.  
They flag hypocrisy, reward wit, punish cruelty, and maintain local truth-standards through communal retelling.  
Where tech calls this “moderation,” aunties call it *manners.*

---

## 🪶 3.  Indigenous Analytics  
Long before dashboards, oral cultures measured reach by echo:  
how far a story travelled before it returned, slightly altered, proving survival.  
The aunties’ metric is resonance time, not click-through rate.  
Virality is judged by *how many dinners later it’s still funny.*

## 💡 4.  Lessons for Design  
1. **Emotion is metadata.** Track feeling, not only traffic.  
2. **Context beats scale.** A well-placed whisper outperforms a billboard.  
3. **Humour is protocol.** Laughter authenticates the channel.  
4. **Ethics = Longevity.** Cruel gossip burns fast; generous gossip endures.  

Design systems that behave more like aunties: curious, relational, self-correcting.

## 🪞 5.  Philosophical Reading — The Social Thermostat  
Aunties regulate temperature.  
Too cold (apathy): nothing spreads.  
Too hot (malice): community fractures.  
Their talk maintains narrative climate within livable range—folk thermodynamics of culture.

*☕ The Auntie Model of Memetic Transmission — Indigenous Analytics of Stickiness* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It honours communal intelligence as the original attention algorithm and re-centres relational ethics in the study of virality.
