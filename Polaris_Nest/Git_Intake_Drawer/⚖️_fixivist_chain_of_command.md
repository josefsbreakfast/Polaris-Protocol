*Exploring how activist energy (‚Äúfix it now‚Äù) intersects with institutional command structures.*

## Fixivist Logic  
- Urgency: act quickly, repair harm, prevent further damage.  
- Values: transparency, speed, survivor-centred action.  
- Risks: bypassing safeguards, overexposure, vulnerability to claims of irregularity.  

---

## Chain of Command Logic  
- Authority: mandate, oversight, procedural legitimacy.  
- Values: compliance, stability, precedent.  
- Risks: inertia, denial, capture, deflection.  

---

## The Tension  
- Fixivists push for urgent repair.  
- Chain of command slows or blocks action.  
- Both are needed: urgency without legitimacy risks collapse, legitimacy without urgency risks paralysis.

It records the structural tension between urgent survivor-led repair and formal institutional processes.
