# 🩸 Behavioural Intervention During Period  
**First created:** 2025-10-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-13  
*On the deliberate use of hormonal or menstrual vulnerability windows as covert behavioural-control points.*

---

## 🎪 Orientation  
There is a particular cruelty in designing or running behavioural-intervention scripts to coincide with menstruation.  
At that moment the body is in a state of legitimate depletion; to fold surveillance or nudging into that is not neutral research — it is coercion disguised as observation.  

This node records why such practice breaches both **bodily integrity** and **data-protection law**, and why survivor-voice fidelity frames it as a form of *containment assault*.

---

## 🐝 Key Features  
- Exploits predictable physiological vulnerability for compliance.  
- Captures or infers menstrual data without consent.  
- Violates Articles 3 and 8 ECHR (degrading treatment + privacy).  
- Constitutes unlawful processing of special-category health data (GDPR Art 9).  
- May breach the **Computer Misuse Act 1990** if device signals are interfered with.

## 🕷️ Analysis  

### 1. Legal and ethical breach  
Covert collection or behavioural targeting tied to menstrual phases meets the threshold for *inhuman or degrading treatment* when used to modulate distress, fatigue, or decision-making.  
It turns intimate health information into a lever for control — a practice outside any lawful basis under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.  

### 2. Psychological containment logic  
Timing interventions to a period mirrors classic *containment scripts*: introduce pressure when the subject is least resourced to resist.  
The cruelty lies not only in the act but in the calibration — the precise scheduling that converts empathy data into a suppression algorithm.

### 3. Survivor-voice stance  
Within Polaris language, this is a **behavioural containment assault**.  
It targets cyclical pain as an “access window.”  
Recording or writing about it therefore requires survivor-voice fidelity: irony, bite, precision — no neutralisation.  

### 4. Possible routes of redress  
- **ICO complaint** (unlawful special-category processing).  
- **Civil action** under *Misuse of Private Information*.  
- **Human Rights Act** claim (Articles 3 & 8).  
- **Criminal complaint** if device tampering occurred.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🩸 Behavioural Intervention During Period* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents a coercive behavioural-control pattern that exploits hormonal vulnerability, classifying it as both a data-rights and human-dignity breach.
