# 🕰️ Institutional Timescales of Repair — how long change actually takes  
**First created:** 2025-10-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-25  
*When scandal moves at tweet speed and remediation crawls at civil-service pace.*

---

## 🌱 Scope
This node models the **temporal anatomy** of government and organisational response once wrongdoing or systemic failure becomes visible.  
It provides a diagnostic scaffold for mapping how long it takes for acknowledgement, investigation, and cultural repair to materialise after exposure — whether the issue is surveillance misuse, data leaks, or bureaucratic scandal (*Operation Shande* class events).

---

## 🧭 Orientation
Every institution runs on two clocks:

1. **The outrage clock** — media, public, and political pressure seeking instant response.  
2. **The administrative clock** — procurement cycles, inquiries, and budget reviews measured in years.

Understanding this divergence helps analysts and survivors distinguish *symbolic correction* from *substantive change.*

## 🧩 Phases of remediation

| Phase | Typical duration | Key actions | Common pathologies |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **1. Discovery & Containment** | 3 – 9 months | Internal briefings, document holds, temporary suspensions, “lessons learned” memos | Rapid scapegoating, data hoarding, PR over-communication |
| **2. Audit & Reform Design** | 9 – 24 months | External inquiry, NAO or judge-led review, legislative drafting, procurement unwind | Inquiry fatigue, redaction creep, inter-departmental blame |
| **3. Implementation & Cultural Repair** | 2 – 5 years | Policy integration, training, new oversight bodies, public follow-up | Resource decay, bureaucratic amnesia, ethics theatre |

**Total remediation horizon:** *≈ 3 – 7 years* for genuine outcomes under favourable political conditions.

## 🔎 Key dynamics

### ⚡ Shame velocity
The speed at which exposure circulates through media and political discourse —  
high energy, short half-life, often resolved through statements rather than structural shifts.

### 🧩 Repair half-life
The time required for reforms to stabilise inside budgets, contracts, and staff culture —  
slow, cumulative, and easily reversed when attention fades.

### ⏳ Temporal slippage
The gap between the two clocks creates the illusion of responsiveness while preserving status quo architectures.

## 🧮 Diagnostic questions
1. What clock is this institution currently obeying — outrage or administration?  
2. How long until the next budget or spending-review cycle can embed reform?  
3. Which actors benefit from keeping the process “under review”?  
4. When will independent verification become possible (NAO, select committee, tribunal)?  
5. How will survivors or affected publics experience this time lag?

## 🛠️ Intervention points

| Lever | Action | Expected effect |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Statutory review deadlines** | Legislate fixed response windows for audits & publication | Reduces drift in Phase 2 |
| **Ring-fenced remediation funds** | Budget for reparative measures at exposure time | Prevents funding fatigue |
| **Transparency clocks** | Require agencies to publish milestone progress | Keeps outrage energy available for accountability |
| **Survivor participation** | Include affected publics in review panels | Aligns moral and administrative timeframes |

*🕰️ Institutional Timescales of Repair* is a meta-node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It charts the temporal politics of accountability — showing how quickly shame travels and how slowly systems change.
