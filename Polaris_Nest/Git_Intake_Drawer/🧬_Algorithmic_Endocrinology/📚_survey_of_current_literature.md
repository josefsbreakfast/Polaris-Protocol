## ⚙️ 4.  Governance, Ethics, and Oversight  

- **European Commission, 2024 – *AI Act (final text).*  
  *Defines “high-risk” AI categories; health systems included nominally but endocrine effects unaddressed.*  

- **ICO & MHRA Joint Guidance, 2023 – “Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Health.”**  
  *Outlines regulatory overlap; confirms behavioural-app gap in medical-device law.*  

- **World Health Organization, 2023 – *Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence for Health.*  
  *Calls for risk-benefit evaluation including psychological safety; no endocrine criteria yet.*  

- **OECD, 2024 – “AI in Health: Accountability and Safety.”**  
  *Suggests algorithmic impact assessments modelled on environmental frameworks.*

## 🌍 5.  Cross-Disciplinary Bridgeworks  

- **Bateson G., 1972 – *Steps to an Ecology of Mind.*  
  *Classic systems-theory reference linking feedback and ecology—conceptual DNA for this cluster.*  

- **Latour B., 2005 – *Reassembling the Social.*  
  *Provides theoretical language for understanding algorithms as ecological actors.*  

- **Nissenbaum H., 2020 – *Privacy in Context.*

## 🧾 6.  Synthesis Themes Emerging in 2024–25  

| Theme | Emerging Insight | Research Gap |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Algorithmic Diets** | Effective at micro-scale adherence | Unknown long-term endocrine outcomes |
| **Affective Computing** | Proven dopamine-loop design | No cortisol-level auditing |
| **Digital Stress** | Chronic sympathetic activation measured | Lacks population endocrinology correlation |
| **Governance** | AI-Act style frameworks maturing | Missing physiological safety mandate |
| **Ecological Ethics** | Concept gaining traction in design theory | Needs empirical grounding |

## 🧩 7.  Research Priorities for 2026–2030  

1. Longitudinal studies linking digital exposure to hormonal assays.  
2. Development of **endocrine safety metrics** for algorithmic environments.  
3. Integration of **AI ethics + public-health data** within governance modelling.  
4. Pilot **Algorithmic Health Impact Assessments (AHIAs)** in NHS and EU contexts.  
5. Cross-training curricula in computer science, endocrinology, and environmental ethics.
