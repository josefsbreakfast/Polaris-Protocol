## 🧭 Orientation  

Algorithms now shape the biochemical climate of daily life.  
They influence cortisol, dopamine, appetite, and sleep across entire populations.  
This node proposes an **ecological ethics** for algorithmic design—principles and practices that treat human physiology as shared habitat rather than exploitable substrate.  

It asks: if engagement design can alter hormones, what duties follow for those who engineer it?

## 🌿 1.  From Individual Optimisation to Collective Homeostasis  

Traditional digital ethics frames responsibility around **individual outcomes**: consent, privacy, user satisfaction.  
Ecological ethics reframes responsibility toward **systemic stability**:  
how design decisions affect hormonal balance, sleep patterns, and emotional synchrony across the population.  

Key shift:  
> From “Does this help the user?” → to “Does this destabilise the ecosystem?”  

The metric of virtue becomes *collective homeostasis*.

## 🩸 2.  Principles of Ecological Algorithmic Design  

| Principle | Description | Analogue |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Feedback Awareness** | Model endocrine, emotional, and behavioural feedback loops before deployment. | Environmental impact forecasting |
| **Biodiversity Preservation** | Encourage varied attention, schedules, and responses rather than homogenised engagement. | Ecosystem diversity |
| **Minimal Hormonal Intrusion** | Reduce volatility; design for calm and recovery. | Low-impact architecture |
| **Transparency of Influence** | Reveal when and how algorithms modulate mood or appetite. | Food labelling |
| **Right to Rest** | Guarantee disengagement windows free from algorithmic prompting. | Noise ordinances |

Together, these form an ethical code aligned with *metabolic sustainability*.

## ⚙️ 3.  Designing for Stability  

Practical measures:  
- **Circadian-aware interfaces:** respect daylight cycles; dim or defer stimulation during rest hours.  
- **Predictability gradients:** reward consistent rhythm, not constant novelty.  
- **HPA-sparing notifications:** batch non-urgent alerts to avoid micro-stress cascades.  
- **Community buffering:** design for peer regulation—social calm rather than social contagion.  
- **Hormonal integrity audits:** periodic testing of design changes for endocrine impact.  

These steps transform “user experience” into **ecosystem stewardship**.

## 🧭 4.  Ethical Governance Architecture  

1. **Algorithmic Ecology Boards** — cross-disciplinary panels including endocrinologists, ecologists, and ethicists.  
2. **Algorithmic Health Impact Assessment (AHIA)** — mandatory for large-scale deployments, evaluating biochemical externalities.  
3. **Endocrine Footprint Labelling** — standardised disclosure of engagement intensity, time-of-day targeting, and stress-potential indices.  
4. **Open-data trust models** — allow citizens to monitor collective hormonal metrics while preserving privacy.  
5. **Precautionary thresholds** — if systemic risk is uncertain, limit scale until safety verified.  

Governance becomes a form of **bio-regulation**, not just information management.

## 🧬 5.  The Right to Biochemical Stability  

Every person has a right to maintain internal equilibrium free from unwanted algorithmic disturbance.  
This principle extends human-rights language from *mental integrity* to *metabolic integrity.*  
It reframes algorithmic exposure as a **public-health and dignity issue**, not only a data-protection concern.  

A stable endocrine environment is the ground of autonomy.

## 🌱 6.  Design as Ecological Citizenship  

Engineers, policymakers, and users share one biome: the body.  
An ecological ethics of design demands the humility of coexistence—  
to create not weapons of engagement, but instruments of balance.  

> The goal is not efficiency.  
> The goal is a livable hormonal climate.
