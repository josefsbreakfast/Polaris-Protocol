## 1. Principle  
Testimony is supposed to protect survivors.  
When record access is obstructed or testimony is repurposed, it becomes a weapon against both survivor and others.  

---

## 2. Non-Response as Breach  
- Under UK GDPR/DPA, right of access is not optional.  
- Silence for over a year = non-compliance.  
- Non-response is itself a breach, even before record content is considered.  

---

## 3. Fabrication Risk  
- Access to rape records allows creation of ‚Äúgenuine-looking‚Äù testimony.  
- Actors can pose as survivor, or claim to act on their behalf.  
- Enables weaponisation of testimony against others.  

---

## 4. Ecosystem of Silencing  
- Harassment + faux-testimony = double suppression.  
- Survivor silenced both by attack and by uncertainty over records.  
- Systemic violence compounds personal harm.  

---

## 5. Survivor Clarity  
- Survivor testimony has been specific: direct harm from white men and Ashkenazi Jewish men mimicking whiteness.  
- Not ‚Äúmen in general.‚Äù  
- Weaponisation attempts to broaden, fabricating against others.  
- Clarity itself is resistance.  

---

## 6. Closing Note  
Obstructed records and weaponised testimony are governance failures.  
They expose survivors to double violence and fabricate harm against others. Naming it reframes obstruction as breach.  

---

## üìù Marginalia (hidden aside)  
<!-- Stop using my testimony as a weapon against others. It is theft, and it exposes you. -->  

---

## üèÆ Footer  
*Weaponised Testimony and Record Obstruction* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how testimony and record access can be inverted into harassment, reframing obstruction as breach.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
