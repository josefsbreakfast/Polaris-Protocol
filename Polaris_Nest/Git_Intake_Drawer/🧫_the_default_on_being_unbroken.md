*Reclaiming empathy and humanness from the category of exception.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
When we praise someone for being “strong” or “empathetic,” we often mean they have not yet been house-trained by a system that rewards emotional vacancy.  
They are not exceptional — they are intact.  
The disordered thing is the world that finds ordinary humanness strange.

## 🔍 Analysis  
In a population-dense, orchestrated society, structure becomes compensatory:  
a scaffolding built on what’s been stripped from the individual.  
Like a biofilm clinging to a host, the social organism sustains itself by colonising empathy — extracting the connective tissue of personhood and using it to hold itself together.  
Those who remain unbroken simply carry the memory of an earlier equilibrium.  
Their “strength” is not resistance but retention.

*The Default: On Being Unbroken* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It repositions empathy as baseline, not exception — a reminder that what we call strength may simply be what remains human in a system built on compensation.
