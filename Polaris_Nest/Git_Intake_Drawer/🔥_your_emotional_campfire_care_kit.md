# 🔥 Your Emotional Campfire Care Kit  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*A Polaris model for tending your psychological “campfire” during periods of societal instability, bureaucratic harm, or chronic political stress.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Following the 🌲 *Campfire Stability Model*, this node provides a practical toolkit for tending your emotional “fire”.

It treats overwhelm not as personal failure but as:

- structural depletion,  
- environmental pressure,  
- bureaucratic stress exposure,  
- and democratic instability fatigue.

This care kit offers small, practical, trauma-informed interventions that stabilise the ember-base when the “weather” (politics, institutions, systems) is hostile.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Translates the campfire metaphor into practical tools.  
- Centres gentle, non-shaming, sensory and regulatory support.  
- Designed for people navigating bureaucratic harm, uncertainty or political anxiety.  
- Focuses on repair of embers, addition of logs, and protection from wind/rain.  
- Fully compatible with trauma-informed, neurodivergent-friendly coping.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 🪵 1. Adding Logs (Deep Supports)  
Logs restore structural stability.  
These are the things that rebuild the foundation of the fire.

#### **a) Safe people**  
One or two people you can be messy around.

#### **b) Consistent routines**  
Sleep windows, familiar foods, predictable rhythms.

#### **c) Material stability**  
Housing, medication, benefits, financial order.

#### **d) Reducing unnecessary exposure**  
No “doomfeeding” from media or bureaucracy when already depleted.

#### **e) Permission to rest**  
Letting the fire sit instead of forcing it to blaze.

Logs are long-term and non-negotiable.

### ✨ 2. Adding Kindling (Small Supports)  
Kindling is about *quick ignition* — tiny interventions that make life more manageable.

#### **Examples of kindling:**  
- hot drink  
- warm blanket  
- shower or bath  
- low-stimulation TV  
- easy foods  
- tactile comfort (soft textures)  
- music or ambient sound  
- mild movement (stretching, walking indoors)  
- light social contact  
- animal contact  
- humour  
- repetitive tasks  

Kindling creates momentum when everything feels heavy.

### 🔥 3. Rebuilding Embers (Resilience Recovery)  
Embers represent stored stability.  
They recover slowly.

#### Ways to rebuild:  
- Slow mornings, not alarmed awakenings  
- Protecting your identity from bureaucratic distortion  
- Naming what’s yours and what’s the system’s  
- Letting yourself be angry without judging it  
- Gentle joy (not forced happiness)  
- Re-engaging with safe communities  
- Choosing your news sources  
- Creativity without expectation  

Embers recover when pressure decreases.

### 💨 4. Blocking Wind (Agitation & Panic Reduction)  
Wind = societal noise / agitation.

To block the wind:

- mute hostile social media  
- avoid rapid-response conversations  
- turn off push notifications  
- use slow media  
- limit arguments with bad-faith actors  
- choose information windows (e.g., “I check news only twice today”)  
- practise narrowing your perception to what is *here now*  

This preserves the fire’s oxygen.

---

### 🌧️ 5. Blocking Rain (Depletion & Shut-Down Prevention)  
Rain = exhaustion, hopelessness, emotional shutdown.

Block rain by:

- cutting out non-essential bureaucratic tasks  
- asking for deadline extensions  
- using scripts for difficult calls  
- simplifying meals  
- lowering domestic standards temporarily  
- saying “no” without apology  
- letting yourself function at 40% rather than forcing 90%  

Rain-blocking is self-defensive, not indulgent.

---

### 🚩 6. Recognising Smoke Signals  
Smoke = early indicators of emotional overload.

Smoke signals include:

- irritability  
- emotional numbness  
- crying without knowing why  
- inability to start tasks  
- catastrophic thinking  
- hypervigilance around data  
- dread before opening emails  
- feeling “wrong” in your body  
- wanting to disappear  

Smoke is **a message**, not a moral judgement:

> “Please tend the fire now.”

---

### 🧭 7. Crisis Edges: When the Fire Needs Extra Support  
If the fire is struggling to stay lit:

- reach out to someone safe, even briefly  
- switch to bare-minimum living  
- break tasks into 20-second fragments  
- externalise overwhelm (“the world is loud”)  
- use grounding items (stone, fabric, warmth)  
- remind yourself: “This is weather. I am not the weather.”  

The goal is not roaring flames —  
just **enough warmth to keep going**.
