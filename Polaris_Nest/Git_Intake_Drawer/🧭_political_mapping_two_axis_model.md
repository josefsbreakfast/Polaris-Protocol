# 🧭 Political Mapping: The Two-Axis Model  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*A simple X-Y framework for locating ideologies by both values and attitudes to government involvement.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
The single left–right scale no longer describes how people or policies behave.  
Most political conflict today crosses two independent questions:

1. **Economic / Cultural Values** — the traditional left–right spectrum.  
2. **Degree of State or Institutional Involvement** — from interventionist to hands-off.

Mapping both creates a **four-quadrant model** that captures contemporary alignment far better than party branding.

## 🧩 Axes  

| Axis | Description | Range |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **X – Values Axis** | Economic equality ↔ Market freedom; collective vs individual orientation. | Left ↔ Right |
| **Y – Intervention Axis** | Preference for institutional or state involvement vs autonomy. | Up = Strong state / regulation Down = Minimal state / laissez-faire |

---

## 🔍 The Four Quadrants  

| Quadrant | Summary | Typical Emphases |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Top-Left** | *Communitarian Interventionist* | Social democracy, regulation to enforce equality, welfare state. |
| **Top-Right** | *Authoritarian Conservative* | Security state, nationalism, corporate alignment. |
| **Bottom-Left** | *Libertarian Socialist / Anarchist* | Mutual aid, decentralised organisation, minimal coercion. |
| **Bottom-Right** | *Market Libertarian / Classical Liberal* | Free markets, limited government, civic voluntarism. |

---

## 🧮 Why It Matters  
Policy debates rarely fail because of disagreement over values alone; they fail because participants sit on different *intervention* levels.  
Understanding both axes clarifies alliances that appear paradoxical — for example, left- and right-libertarians sharing distrust of state power while diverging on wealth distribution.

## 🧭 Actor Mapping vs Demos Mapping  

| Type | What It Maps | Use Case | Visualisation |
|------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Actor Mapping** | Political figures, institutions, ideological blocs | Explains how parties, think-tanks, and states behave; tracks coalitions or policy drift | X-Y grid (two-axis model) |
| **Demos Mapping** | Citizens, voters, social clusters | Analyses population attitudes, voting patterns, social-media discourse | Density plots, Overton-window curves, clustering graphs |

**Actor Mapping** is structural: it shows where power operates and how elites position themselves.  
**Demos Mapping** is behavioural: it shows how populations distribute across values and intervention preferences.  

Confusing the two leads to category errors — mistaking a party’s rhetoric for its base’s beliefs, or assuming voter clusters move as quickly as media narratives.  
Both are necessary; together they reveal the gap between *governed image* and *governing reality.*

## 🔥🪨 Political Alchemy  
Every political model begins as alchemy: a search for the hidden metals that make power transmute into legitimacy.  
The “scientific” moment arrives only when the formula can be tested and repeated — yet the subject keeps changing the reagents.  
Political science therefore lives at the border of **fire** and **stone**: heat for transformation, weight for evidence.  
Too much fire and you get ideology; too much stone and you get bureaucracy.  
The trick is tempering both until the crucible holds.

### 🪞 Lineage Note  

This framework descends from earlier two-axis models in political science and popular discourse:  

- **The Nolan Chart (David Nolan, 1971)** — introduced the idea of plotting economic freedom against personal freedom to reveal four ideological quadrants.  
- **The Political Compass (early 2000s)** — an online adaptation that popularised “Authoritarian ↔ Libertarian” on the Y-axis and “Left ↔ Right” on the X-axis.  

The **Polaris two-axis model** keeps the geometric logic but updates its semantics:  
- replaces moral terms with **governance-based language** (“State / Regulation” vs “Minimal State / Autonomy”),  
- treats the grid as a **diagnostic tool** for mapping institutions and power blocs rather than individual belief systems, and  
- integrates it into broader systemic analysis linking ideology, legitimacy, and market regulation.

*Political Mapping: The Two-Axis Model* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a simple geometric framework for situating ideologies by both moral values and preferred degree of state involvement, with extensions for mapping actors vs the demos, a reflective alchemy of method, and clear lineage to its predecessors.
