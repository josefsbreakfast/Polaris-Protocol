# ⚖️ Royalties and Liability for Uncredited Training Data — Misclassification & Special-Purpose Use  
**First created:** 2025-10-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-20  
*A reference brief on ownership, compensation, and Crown liability for misclassified or dual-use AI training datasets.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

A dataset originating from a UK university (e.g., student work, internal research papers) was:

1️⃣ **Misclassified** under a Defence Protocol — tagged as strategic research or “national-security related” data;  
2️⃣ **Transferred to / used by** a *special-purpose vehicle (SPV)* or government-linked contractor for model training;  
3️⃣ **Used commercially** (e.g., spin-out, dual-use AI platform).

## 🧩 Key Legal Frames in Play  

| Domain | Question | Governing Law / Regime |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Copyright & Database Rights | Did copying of expressive work occur? | CDPA 1988 ss. 17, 21 ; Database Regulations 1997 |
| Data Protection / GDPR | Was personal data repurposed under false classification? | UK GDPR Arts 5–6, 82 ; DPA 2018 Sch. 2 para 26 (national security exemption) |
| National-Security Exemption | Does the “defence purpose” block ordinary civil remedies? | DPA 2018 ss. 26–27 ; Crown Proceedings Act 1947 ; state-immunity principles |
| Export Control & Dual-Use | Was the dataset or model subject to export control? | Export Control Act 2002 ; Export Control Order 2008 ; UK Dual-Use List |
| Public Law / Judicial Review | Was the classification or transfer *ultra vires* ? | Administrative law — JR on irrationality / proportionality |
| Equitable Remedies | Could authors claim unjust enrichment or account of profits? | Common-law restitution principles |

## ⚖️ 1️⃣ If Data Were Misclassified  

- Misclassification does **not extinguish private rights**; it restricts oversight until corrected.  
- While misclassified, licensing is impossible; after correction, authors may claim compensation for commercial exploitation.  

> Analogy — **s. 55 Patents Act 1977 (Crown use of inventions):** royalty-equivalent compensation is paid *ex post*.  
> Copyright should follow the same equitable logic: Crown or contractor pays “reasonable compensation” once misclassification is lifted.

## ⚖️ 2️⃣ Special-Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Liability  

| Type of SPV | Responsibility | Exposure |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Private contractor acting for MoD / Home Office | Covered by defence contract; owes indemnities to Crown | Primary copyright / GDPR liability unless statutory immunity applies |
| University spin-out with govt funding | Not Crown-immune | Liable under CDPA & GDPR; royalty or damages to authors |
| Public corporation (wholly state-owned) | May invoke *Crown use* defence | Compensation “as if by licence” — royalty-equivalent |

---

## ⚙️ 3️⃣ When Would Royalties Be Due?  

| Condition | Royalty / Compensation Trigger |
|:--|:--|
| Use solely for defence / security | Exempt from standard royalties; internal Crown use = non-commercial |
| Later commercialised (dual-use AI product) | ✅ Reasonable royalty or profits account due |
| SPV profited independently | ✅ Royalties / restitution to rights-holders |
| Misclassification blocked licence negotiation | ✅ Crown owes *ex post* equitable compensation |

---

## 🧠 4️⃣ GDPR Exemptions Interaction  

- National-security exemption permits departure only “to the extent necessary.” It does **not** erase Art 82 damages liability.  
- Erroneous defence tag = unlawful processing → distress / economic loss claims.  
- Quantum may mirror hypothetical licence value.

---

## 🧩 5️⃣ Case Analogues / Precedents  

| Reference | Analogy |
|:--|:--|
| *Crown Use of Inventions (1950s)* | “Reasonable compensation” owed even under secrecy |
| *R (Privacy International) v Investigatory Powers Tribunal* [2019] UKSC 22 | Security decisions reviewable if based on legal error |
| ICO v Cabinet Office (2022) | Security-related processing still needs lawful basis |
| *Crown Proceedings Act 1947* | Allows civil suits against Crown for statutory breach |

---

## 💰 6️⃣ Royalty Computation (if owed)  

- Benchmark = licence fee for scope + duration.  
- Crown use adjustment ≈ 50–75 % of commercial rate (public interest discount).  
- Add Art 82 GDPR damages for distress (£1k–£5k typical range per person).

---

## 🧭 7️⃣ Summary Logic  

1️⃣ Misclassification ≠ ownership transfer.  
2️⃣ Commercial reuse → compensation duty.  
3️⃣ Private SPV → direct liability.  
4️⃣ Crown entity → reasonable compensation under Crown-use principle.  
5️⃣ Defence tag delays remedy but does not erase rights.
