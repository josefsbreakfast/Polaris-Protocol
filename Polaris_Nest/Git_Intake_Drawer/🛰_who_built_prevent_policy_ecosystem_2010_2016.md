# 🛰 Who Built Prevent? (Policy Ecosystem 2010–16)  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*A map of the political, institutional, think-tank, policing, and security actors who designed, expanded, and legitimised Prevent during the 2010–2016 period — embedding pre-crime logic into UK governance.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Prevent did not emerge organically.  
It was built — deliberately, strategically, and with heavy influence from:

- counterterror police,  
- Home Office officials,  
- think tanks,  
- private consultants,  
- political advisers,  
- security-aligned NGOs,  
- party-aligned research units.

This node maps the **Policy Ecosystem 2010–2016** — the era when Prevent:

- expanded,  
- hardened,  
- became statutory under CTSA 2015,  
- moved from “policy programme” to “embedded governance.”

---

## 🛰 The Policy Ecosystem (2010–16)

### **1. Home Office Counter-Extremism Unit**  
The central force in shaping Prevent.  
Functions:

- drafting policy,  
- shaping indicators,  
- managing Prevent Duty guidance,  
- training providers,  
- working with police Prevent teams.

Priorities reflected security-world assumptions, not safeguarding practice.

---

### **2. OSCT – Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism**  
Influential in embedding pre-crime logic.

- Framed extremism as psychological vulnerability.  
- Positioned metadata and behavioural indicators as intelligence tools.  
- Supported Channel’s multi-agency structure.

Provided language that blurred welfare and policing.

---

### **3. Police Prevent Networks (CT Policing)**  
Prevent is police-built at its core.

- Defined referral pathways.  
- Designed triage structures.  
- Developed “early indicators.”  
- Ran the majority of hidden screening.  
- Fed the secrecy architecture under CTSA.

Their influence shaped Prevent more than any other actor.

---

### **4. Think Tanks (especially Quilliam)**  
See Node 22 for deep analysis.

Roles:

- authored ideological templates,  
- provided MPs with ready-made talking points,  
- produced risk-indicator lists that entered official training,  
- influenced extremism definitions in CTSA guidance,  
- positioned Muslim communities as “ideological risk groups.”

Quilliam was not the only one —  
Policy Exchange, Henry Jackson Society, Civitas also shaped narratives.

---

### **5. Special Advisers & Political Comms Units**  
Under the Coalition government and early Cameron-era majority:

- SpAds worked closely with Home Office teams,  
- reframed Prevent as a political brand,  
- managed public messaging to focus on “resilience,”  
- kept criticism out of mainstream coverage.

Their comms strategy masked the system’s racialised architecture.

---

### **6. Local Authorities (varied role)**  
Some LAs resisted Prevent.  
Others:

- integrated Prevent into safeguarding,  
- expanded local referral pathways,  
- ran community monitoring programmes.

Their inconsistent practices created the patchwork that still exists today.

---

### **7. Schools, NHS Trusts, Universities (statutory partners)**  
After CTSA 2015:

- Education and health sectors were pulled into Prevent without democratic debate.  
- Institutions absorbed counterterror logic through training requirements.  
- “Neutral” safeguarding became inseparable from security surveillance.

These partners built Prevent’s bureaucracy — even when they disagreed with it.

---

### **8. External Consultants & Security Contractors**  
A quiet influence but powerful:

- built training modules,  
- sold algorithmic risk tools,  
- produced Prevent e-learning,  
- drafted behavioural indicator checklists.

The commercialisation of counter-extremism expanded Prevent’s logic.

---

### **9. Parliament (indirect influence)**  
Most MPs had minimal actual understanding of Prevent.

Their influence came from:

- rubber-stamping CTSA 2015,  
- accepting think-tank briefings uncritically,  
- failing to create democratic oversight mechanisms.

This passivity allowed non-democratic actors to shape the system heavily.

---

## 🧪 Case Window (Patterns)

*Synthesised from parliamentary records, policy papers, and credible civil liberties research — no personal data.*

- Policy Exchange publications quoted in early Prevent reviews.  
- Quilliam phrases reproduced almost verbatim in CTSA guidance.  
- OSCT documents shaping Channel’s vulnerability framework.  
- Police Prevent networks drafting multi-agency risk procedure.  
- Local authorities reporting pressure to escalate during 2013–15.  
- Commercial e-learning providers selling Prevent “certification.”

Prevent is a mosaic of influences — with security actors at the centre.

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• Prevent was shaped by actors with minimal democratic accountability**  
Unelected, opaque, ideologically motivated.

### **• Policymaking was driven by fear, not evidence**  
9/11, 7/7, and global events created political vulnerability.

### **• Racialised narratives entered legislation unchecked**  
Ideological frames became statutory duties.

### **• The state outsourced democratic judgement to private actors**  
Think tanks substituted for public debate.

### **• The architecture is now entrenched**  
Undoing Prevent requires undoing an entire ecosystem.
