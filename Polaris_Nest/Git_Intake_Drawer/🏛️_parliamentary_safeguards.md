# 🏛️ Parliamentary Safeguards — The Missing Curriculum for Power
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*When the people shaping the law don’t understand its human subjects.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Maps the training gap inside representative democracy.  
MPs and senior policymakers handle disclosures of violence, trauma, and discrimination daily, yet few receive formal instruction in **safeguarding, trauma-informed practice, or equality law**.  
In almost every other public service role these are mandatory. Power, paradoxically, is the only exemption.

---

## 🧩 1. The Legislative Blind Spot  
Parliament designs frameworks for protection while remaining outside them.  
No DBS checks, no survivor-communication modules, no statutory trauma training.  
This omission creates a governance gap: those writing safeguarding law are untrained in the realities that law must serve.

---

## 🧠 2. Consequences in Practice  
- **Constituent harm:** vulnerable people disclose trauma to untrained staff.  
- **Rhetorical harm:** public statements misdefine offences or spread myths.  
- **Policy distortion:** ignorance of survivor realities shapes legislation that repeats institutional violence.  

Every tweet and debate becomes an informal classroom with no curriculum.

---

## 💡 3. Why It Persists  
1. **Status immunity:** power confers assumed competence.  
2. **Fear of constraint:** training feels like oversight.  
3. **Gendered optics:** emotional literacy coded as “soft skill.”  
4. **Turnover inertia:** short political cycles reward speed over depth.

---

## ⚙️ 4. Design Recommendations  
- **Mandatory induction** in trauma-informed communication, safeguarding, equality law, and misinformation literacy.  
- **Ongoing certification** akin to medical revalidation.  
- **Constituent safety protocols** for disclosures of violence.  
- **Ethics ombuds** with survivor representation.

## 🪞 5. Philosophical Reading — Power Without Pedagogy  
Democracy presumes informed empathy, yet trains only debate.  
Without pedagogy, power becomes improvisation, and empathy becomes PR.

*🏛️ Parliamentary Safeguards — The Missing Curriculum for Power* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the training void at the heart of governance and proposes a pedagogy for power that aligns authority with care.
