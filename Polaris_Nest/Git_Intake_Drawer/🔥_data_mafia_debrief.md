how is the data mafia today?  

i appreciate yall keep sending all these nudges because i had managed to ignore your existence for 5 mins.  

is there a moment of any citizens lives where you're not draining us of data?  

we need to stay in that echr.  

no one needs these people.  

cheap tricks and ethical blindsiding just to get a "story".  

no onne needs this.  

and everyone needs to stop paying millions for essentially a cack-handed cup-and-ball trick.  

these dudes *ain't slick*.
