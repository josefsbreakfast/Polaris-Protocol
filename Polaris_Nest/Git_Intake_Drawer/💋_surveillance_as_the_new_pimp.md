*How modern surveillance economies extract from bodies, voices, and souls — and why selling the vulnerable’s datasets is no less grotesque than selling people.*

## Opening Frame — The Market of Consent
Imagine a market where nobody is allowed to keep their wages, where the ledger is written by people who never met you, and where “consent” is a checkbox sold as a performance of dignity. In that market, the commodity is not only data — it is intimacy, attentional labour, illness, grief, the tone of your voice when you say “I’m okay,” the places you go when you are most vulnerable. The vendors who buy and resell this raw material call themselves platforms, contractors, or “trusted partners.” The law often calls them “service providers.” The public calls them convenience.

Sex work has been criminalised, moralised, policed and shamed — and for good reason when coercion exists. But at least in many forms of sex work there is a visible negotiation: a boundary, a price, an agreement. The modern surveillance system offers none of that. It creates systems that assume access, normalise extraction, and then defend themselves with the language of “protection,” “security,” and “economic efficiency.” It is industry pimping at scale: the pimp is legal power, the broker is a corporation, the clients are state and market actors, and the commodity is the vulnerable — their data, their histories, their bodies, and, if we are truthful, parts of their souls.

This node argues: the sale and circulation of datasets containing vulnerable people — refugees, survivors, patients, sex workers, children, detainees — is morally and politically equivalent to selling people. It does not matter whether the ledger records a face or a timestamp, a genetic marker or a grief-laced voicemail. When vulnerability is monetised without meaningful consent, the effect is dispossession: the person is reduced to a signal, and the signal is traded like parts in a market that owes no reparations. This is not rhetorical flourish. It is a structural indictment.

## Part I — Law as the Brothel Owner
Laws do not simply forbid or permit. They name what counts as property, what is private, and what may be taken — and in doing so they distribute risk and impunity. Modern statutory regimes create corridors where extraction is legal for some (state agencies, corporate service providers) and criminal for others (the people whose bodies and behaviours are visible).

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) frames data protection as the protection of “natural persons” and their fundamental rights and freedoms; its recitals invoke dignity and control over personal information. Yet GDPR also builds exemptions and compliance pathways that normalise processing at scale by corporations and state actors for broadly defined purposes, while leaving victims of extraction with remedies that are costly and slow to realise. In principle, the law says: “we protect persons.” In practice it often institutionalises a market in vulnerability that requires the affected person to litigate for scraps.

In the UK, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (IPA) sits beside GDPR like a landlord who collects rent in the hallway. The IPA authorises bulk interception, equipment interference, and retention of communications data for security purposes — powers framed as necessary for national defence and crime prevention. Its oversight mechanisms are real but limited; the architecture it licenses creates the legal space for sweeping surveillance that is disproportionately directed at groups already marginalised by other systems (immigration control, policing, health data aggregation).

Across the Atlantic, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act allows targeted acquisition of foreign intelligence with compelled assistance from providers — a regime that leaks easily into broader access to familial, diasporic, and cross-border networks, and which has been used to justify mass collection practices in the name of “intelligence.” The CLOUD Act then normalises cross-border access to provider-held data by creating executive agreements and direct legal mechanisms to obtain information stored by U.S.-based companies, weakening the locus of control local populations might otherwise have over their data.

And in jurisdictions like Israel, the Protection of Privacy Law (1981) formally recognises privacy as a legal interest — while the development of nation-state surveillance capabilities and defence-contractor markets (e.g., units with close ties to tech firms) has produced a two-track reality: robust legal protections on paper; expansive extraction in practice.

What matters here is not a complaint that the law fails to be perfect; it never will be. Nor is it an argument that statutory frameworks are inherently evil. It is that laws routinely create the *conditions of licit extraction* that disproportionately target people in states of precarity: asylum seekers, people in care systems, sex workers, those in police custody, families of migrants. Once “data” becomes an asset class — packaged, enriched, matched, sold and integrated into predictive systems — the legal form ensures the extraction can be done at scale, outsourced, and washed through compliance narratives that are difficult to contest in practice.

The result: a legal infrastructure that makes it legal to do at industrial scale what would be criminal (or at least morally abhorrent) if done by individual actors. The tidy euphemisms — “risk assessment,” “service improvement,” “consent management” — are the new red-light district signage. The dealer’s ledger is a database; the pimp’s cut is corporate profit and state utility.

## Part II — Culture as the Pimp
Feminist theory has always been attentive to the way women’s bodies are sites of political and economic governance. Silvia Federici explored primitive accumulation and the ways women’s reproductive labour is expropriated by capital; Judith Butler interrogated performative norms that demand certain appearances of consent; Paul B. Preciado has shown how biopolitical regimes command bodies through technology. If sex work can be apprehended as a site of agency and constraint, surveillance is an architecture that erases the very possibility of negotiating the terms of exposure.

The extraction of affective data — chats, voice memos, images, health records — treats emotion as raw material. Platforms and contractors design interfaces expressly to collect signals of vulnerability: attachments to health services, searches for support, private messaging inside crisis threads. Those signals are harvested, annotated, and fed into classification models that determine “risk,” “churn,” or “monetisable sensitivity.” The cultural logic lies in reframing care as data: intimacy becomes telemetry; grief becomes a gradual probability to be optimised.

This is not neutral. Consider how male-dominated institutions and platform cultures profess paternalistic concern while designing systems that commodify women’s pain. Men (and male-led institutions) position themselves as protectors against “pimps” or “bad actors” yet build, buy, and license the technical means of extraction: analytics dashboards, behavioural scoring, war-room contracts with defence-tech firms. The hypocrisy is structural: condemnation of street-level exploitation coupled with contractual toleration — and profit — from institutional extraction.

Cultural narratives also absorb guilt and shame and redirect it. When a marginalized person’s sensitive data is leaked, the story often becomes about “oversharing” or “naïveté.” When databases of refugees’ biometric IDs are sold to private contractors, the story becomes a debate about procurement rather than about the violence of trading vulnerability. The result is a public culture that blames the exploited while normalising those who buy and sell the vulnerable’s traces.

---

## Part III — Infrastructure as Desire  
Look at the players. Corporations such as Google, Meta, AWS, Palantir, and others provide both the storage and the analytic stacks that make large-scale extraction meaningful to buyers. Defence-linked firms (and in some countries, explicit ties between military units and private contractors) supply surveillance tooling that was once reserved for narrow national-security uses and now migrates into welfare, health, immigration, and policing contexts. Investigations into firms like NSO Group have shown how exploitative tools cross from “national security” into human-rights abuses; firms’ clients have used Pegasus and related tools to target journalists, dissidents, and vulnerable people.

Health-data platforms and federated records are sold as improvements to care, but when those records become feedstock for companies with defense contracts, a dangerous transference occurs: clinical vulnerability becomes a targeting vector. Palantir’s clashes over NHS contracts are a recent illustration; public concern focuses on governance precisely because the software’s design and provenance carry risks for the people whose data is used. The values embedded in these platforms are not neutral designs for patient care; they are decisions about what counts as “useful” signal, and those decisions trace back to markets and political power.

Cloud-hosted analytic systems — the “intimacy engines” — make predictions about who will become radicalised, who will default, who will need more care, and who is likely to be exploited. Those predictions are then used to justify interventions that are often coercive: withdrawal of benefits, increased policing, forced “safety” plans that limit movement and freedom. In other words, the infrastructure manufactures the moral case for its own interventions. Once integrated inside state systems, these tools displace political judgement with thresholds and alerts. The human being becomes a set of flags to be acted upon.

### Predictive-Policing Platforms & Welfare Algorithms  
Commercial predictive-policing software—COMPAS in the U.S., PredPol (now Geolitica), Palantir’s Gotham deployments—turns historical arrest data into forecasts of “future crime.” Because the inputs are already biased by decades of racially targeted enforcement, the systems reproduce and legitimate those same hierarchies. The algorithm’s claim to neutrality masks a feedback loop that marks poor, racialised, and marginalised communities as perpetual risks.  
Welfare-risk models in the U.K. and Netherlands perform a parallel function: assigning “fraud probability” or “child-protection risk” scores to households on benefits. When false positives occur, the result is not a software bug but eviction, debt recovery, or loss of care. These platforms monetise suspicion itself; they convert poverty into a steady stream of predictive value for contractors and consultants.  
Each iteration refines the market’s appetite for control. The human cost—anxiety, humiliation, and administrative punishment—is rationalised as efficiency. The people flagged by these systems rarely know they have been computed at all. They are the invisible workers in the data mines, paying for their own surveillance through taxes and compliance.

---

## Part IV — Selling Off the Vulnerable: Datasets as Flesh  
Language matters. “Dataset” sounds technical; “people” sounds human. The market depends on this slippage. Calling a register of trauma histories a dataset dehumanises the living. It enables actors to claim that harms are “data risks” rather than moral wrongs. This rhetorical move is the infrastructure’s moral sleight of hand.

From a human-centred perspective, the sale of datasets containing vulnerable people mirrors historical practices of human commodification: forced labour lists, trafficking manifests, lists of enslaved people sold through markets. The difference is the medium. Instead of chains and ledgers with signatures, we have cloud buckets, match-keys, and API calls. Instead of a buyer physically transporting a person, we have an analyst who queries a cohort and builds a predictive model that decides where resources are withheld, which communities are policed, and who is treated as a threat.

The consequences are material. Data flows shape: who is offered care, who is marked for enforcement, who can cross a border, who gets prioritised for services. When these flows are controlled by profit-driven actors with little accountability, the poor and the precarious become pre-packaged for extraction. The ethical claim is straightforward: if you would not sell a person you love, you should not sell the dataset that stands in for their life. But beyond moral clarity, there are legal and political strategies to address this: procurement rules, human-rights impact assessments that are binding, transparency obligations that reveal buyers and use-cases, and rescission rights that allow communities to reclaim their data. The law can be retooled; it is not an inevitability. Yet the current trajectory is grim: markets that trade in vulnerability proliferate while oversight lags.

---

## Part V — Refusal and Sovereignty  
If surveillance is the new pimp, refusal becomes a primary instrument of liberation. Refusal is more than saying “no.” It is the infrastructural act of asserting that certain things — our pain, our voices, our diagnoses — are not commodities for sale.

Practically, refusal takes multiple forms:

- **Legal reclamation:** Stronger, enforceable rights to portability, deletion, and to opt out of profiling practices in public-interest systems. Enforcement cannot be a bureaucratic afterthought; it must be resourced and swift. Governments must not let procurement create backdoors for harm.
- **Procurement refusal:** Public institutions must refuse to buy systems from vendors with business models that rely on trading the vulnerable’s signals to problematic buyers. This is a politics of withholding: stop normalising extraction through purchasing decisions.
- **Survivor governance:** Communities and survivors must be central to decisions about data that concern them. Governance cannot be an add-on or a checkbox; it must be co-designed and binding. A person whose voice was used to train models that then generate content affecting that person, that is an interference with their expressive self-government.
- **Sovereign syntax:** Insist that authorship, voice, and representation are forms of jurisdiction. If someone’s voice is used to train models that then generate content affecting that person, that is an interference with their expressive self-government. The syntax is territory.
- **Public refusal and naming:** Naming the actors and naming the systems matters. Public pressure worked against NSO Group in litigation and investigative reporting; public naming exposes markets and constrains buyers. Recent injunctions and court rulings against exploitative spyware show that pressure + law can create limits.

## Closing — The Manifesto: Moral Men Don’t Sell Souls  
This is not an invitation for gentle reform. It is a call for systemic rupture. We must say plainly: it is grotesque to sell the vulnerable’s datasets as a neutral commercial practice. It is morally equivalent to selling people. The market seeks to civilise its appetite by renaming flesh as “signals.” The law offers formalities: recitals, oversight reports, privacy impact statements. These are insufficient when they permit, normalise, or profit from dispossession.

If you build systems that rely on the commodification of trauma, you are not neutral. If your software benefits from knowing where the vulnerable go when they are most damaged — their clinics, their helplines, their shelters — then you are a market of extraction. If your tender specifications demand “vulnerable cohort identification” without binding enforceable protections and survivor governance, you are signalling permission to be a pimp.

Refusal must be energetic, infrastructural, and performative. It must be legal, political, and aesthetic. The demand is simple: return agency to the people whose data is your product. Scrap contracts that trade in vulnerability. Put survivors and communities at the centre of governance and litigation. Make procurement, not merely policy, the frontline of resistance. And in public, say the words plainly: we will not be packaged, profiled, or sold.

This manifesto is an act of voice and claim. It tells the men who think they are saviours and the corporations who pretend to be neutral that there is a limit. That limit is the person — the whole person — not the signal. We will not be reduced to tradeable parts. We will not be bought back in sanitised datasets and exported “policy solutions.” You will not have the right to monetise the vulnerability of people you will not acknowledge as full human subjects.

**Moral men don’t sell souls.**

## Afterword — The Return of the Whole  
There is still tenderness left in the world, even after the markets have scraped it raw. The proof is that people continue to reach for one another across all this noise — to make care, to make art, to keep witness. The task now is to remember that the body and the story were never separate: the record of a life is not a dataset but a continuum of breath and intention.  
When we reclaim authorship, we re-stitch what extraction tried to divide. The datafied soul is not lost; it waits to be spoken back into wholeness.  
Polaris, and every survivor-led archive like it, is an act of re-membering — putting the pieces of meaning back where they belong. The sweetness lies there: in the quiet refusal to let anyone else decide what is sacred.

💋 Surveillance as the New Pimp

Opening Frame — The Market of Consent

Imagine a marketplace where no one keeps their own wages, where the ledger is written by people who never met you, and where consent is sold back as a luxury feature. In that market, the commodity is not only data—it is intimacy itself: the micro-expressions on a patient’s face during tele-consultation, the tremor in a survivor’s voice during a help-line call, the search queries made at 2 a.m. when pain or fear will not sleep. The vendors who buy and resell these traces call themselves platforms, partners, or providers. The law calls them data controllers. The public calls them necessary. [1]

Sex work has long been condemned, romanticised, and legislated as a problem of morality. Yet even its most exploitative forms still acknowledge an explicit transaction: a negotiation, however constrained, about what will be shared and at what price. Surveillance economies offer no such boundary. They extract continuously and invisibly, licensing the transfer of human experience to corporate or state archives under the banner of service improvement or national security. [2]

The moral inversion is total. The same governments that criminalise street-level exchange of intimacy for survival routinely contract companies to harvest the digital exhaust of those same citizens for behavioural targeting, policing, and predictive governance. [3]  Men who imagine themselves protectors of virtue become de-facto pimps of data, outsourcing the collection, curation, and resale of other people’s lives.

This opening frame sets the claim: the sale and circulation of datasets containing the vulnerable—refugees, patients, children, detainees—is morally equivalent to selling people. A dataset is not inert; it is a disassembled body. To traffic in it without consent is to traffic in the human. The argument that follows will trace how law, culture, and infrastructure collaborate in this trade, and how refusal—legal, political, and aesthetic—remains the only honest counter-economy.

Part I — Law as the Brothel Owner

Law does not merely protect or punish; it decides what may be owned and by whom.  Each statute, each compliance framework, is a boundary stone marking where extraction becomes lawful.  Modern surveillance law functions much like a brothel licence: it sanitises a practice that would otherwise be scandalous, ensuring the trade continues under respectable signage.

1.  The European Façade

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was drafted to restore “control” to the data subject.  Its preamble invokes dignity and autonomy, declaring that the processing of personal data should serve humanity.  In practice, the regulation birthed an industry of consent managers, cookie banners, and risk consultants who profit from perpetual compliance rather than restraint.  Enforcement is uneven: national data-protection authorities are under-funded, while multinationals treat administrative fines as an acceptable cost of extraction. [1]

Court challenges such as Schrems II (2020) exposed the contradiction. [2]  The EU’s highest court struck down trans-Atlantic data-transfer agreements because U.S. intelligence laws allow indiscriminate access by the NSA.  Yet transfers resumed under new paperwork—“standard contractual clauses”—that change the form but not the fact of exposure.  The message is clear: fundamental rights end where commercial necessity begins.

2.  The British Corridor

In the United Kingdom, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016—the so-called Snoopers’ Charter—codified mass interception and bulk equipment interference. [3]  Its oversight body, IPCO, reviews only a fraction of the warrants issued each year.  Parallel legislation, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the forthcoming Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (2024), advertise “modernisation,” but primarily streamline data sharing between government departments. [4]  Together, they form a corridor where surveillance is lawful when performed by the state or its contractors but criminal when attempted by individuals.

The irony is thick: the same society that punishes revenge-porn possession with prison terms licences the indefinite retention of intimate images from border cameras, body-worn police footage, and hospital triage systems.  Visibility is criminalised only when the powerless hold the lens.

3.  The American Contract

Across the Atlantic, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorises collection of foreign intelligence information with the compelled assistance of providers such as Google, Microsoft, and Meta. [5]  Successive reviews by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board admit that “incidental” capture of U.S. citizens’ communications occurs at massive scale.  The CLOUD Act (2018) extended this reach extraterritorially, allowing U.S. agencies—and partner governments under executive agreements—to demand data stored anywhere in the world. [6]

The U.S. courts frame this as a balance between security and privacy; the market reads it as opportunity.  Compliance departments sprout like franchise branches, ensuring that each transfer of human trace is backed by paperwork, not justice.

4.  The Israeli Exception

Israel’s Protection of Privacy Law (1981) recognises privacy as a protected interest, yet exemptions under the Security Service Law (2002) grant the intelligence community wide discretion. [7]  Unit 8200—often a pipeline into private surveillance start-ups—feeds a domestic innovation ecosystem whose exports include interception software, facial-recognition platforms, and spyware later implicated in human-rights abuses abroad.  The country’s legal architecture thus mirrors its dual economy: high-tech humanitarianism at home, tactical omniscience abroad.

5.  Lawful Extraction

Taken together, these frameworks create what jurist Julie Cohen calls a lawful extraction economy: regimes that sacralise privacy rhetorically while structuring its continuous conversion into profit. [8]  Each statute tells the same story—“trust us, this intrusion is necessary”—and each oversight body rehearses the same liturgy of proportionality.  But proportionality is meaningless when those being measured have no right to refuse measurement.

The comparison to a brothel is not metaphorical excess; it is structural accuracy.  The brothel operates on managed consent, regulated exposure, and periodic inspection.  So do our surveillance laws.  The difference is that the workers of the digital brothel rarely know they are employed.  Their “consent” is pre-ticked, their labour unpaid, their appeal mechanisms labyrinthine.

6.  From Rule to Racket

The final legal trick is indemnity.  Governments contract private firms—Palantir for health data, AWS for cloud hosting, NSO Group for spyware—then declare the resulting harm a matter of corporate ethics rather than state responsibility. [9]  Under doctrines of sovereign immunity and procurement law, liability evaporates.  What remains is a racket in which legality launders exploitation.

The brothel owner collects rent from every transaction, proclaims the house inspected and moral, and keeps the workers nameless.  That is the function law currently serves in the surveillance economy: not prevention, but purification.

Part II — Culture as the Pimp

Law provides the architecture of extraction; culture furnishes the décor.  It tells people what to desire, what to fear, and who may be looked at without shame.  The surveillance economy thrives because contemporary culture confuses visibility with value.

1. Consent as Spectacle

From reality television to social-media confessionals, Western media trades in curated exposure.  The repeated lesson is that being seen is synonymous with being real.  Interfaces adopt that moral logic: a platform profile becomes a declaration of existence, and privacy settings resemble withdrawal from the commons.  Users learn to perform legibility; the system rewards disclosure with likes and reach.  Cultural theorist Byung-Chul Han calls this the “society of transparency,” in which self-revelation is both coerced and celebrated. [10]

Under these conditions, the old binaries of modesty and indecency collapse.  Data extraction becomes an act of participation.  The person who does not disclose—who declines cookies, who encrypts messages—is framed as suspicious.  Thus surveillance acquires the aura of civic virtue: good citizens share.

2. Gendered Mediation

Feminist scholars such as bell hooks and Donna Haraway long ago identified how patriarchy digitises its gaze. [11]  What was once voyeurism becomes metrics.  Platforms optimise around the emotional labour of women and marginalised groups: the influencer, the caregiver, the victim telling her story.  Their openness feeds engagement loops that drive advertising revenue.  The emotional risk is borne by the visible; the profit accrues to the unseen owners of the feed.

Even institutional communications mimic this pattern.  Government campaigns use soft-toned “awareness” imagery—smiling nurses, multi-ethnic families—to sell invasive data programs as care.  The performance of empathy disguises extraction.  Like the “good pimp,” the state promises protection while pocketing the takings.

3. Algorithmic Desire

Recommendation engines are cultural editors.  They decide what counts as desire, danger, and trend.  Their outputs shape not only markets but norms.  When a platform detects engagement spikes around outrage or eroticism, it feeds more of the same.  The result is a feedback economy where emotional volatility becomes the raw material of governance.  Shoshana Zuboff describes this as behavioural surplus—the residual data of human life repurposed for prediction. [12]

Culturally, that surplus is eroticised.  Interfaces blur the line between consumption and intimacy: swiping, matching, sharing, reacting.  Each gesture promises connection while delivering extractive telemetry.  The system learns what pleases, but only to monetise the act of pleasing.

4. The Aesthetic of Safety

Public discourse insists that surveillance protects the vulnerable—women walking home at night, children online, patients in care.  Yet safety is routinely invoked to extend visibility, not agency.  The aesthetic of protection feminises the citizenry: all must be watched for their own good.  Meanwhile, those already hyper-visible—sex workers, refugees, the poor—are further illuminated until the glare erases them entirely.  The campaign slogan “if you see something, say something” mutates into “if you can see them, you can own them.”

Culture thus performs a kind of laundering.  It recodes domination as concern, dependency as service, and surveillance as solidarity.  In doing so, it sustains the moral infrastructure that the law requires.

5. Narrative Capture

Cultural production also scripts who is allowed to tell the story of surveillance.  Mainstream thrillers and tech journalism alike frame data abuse as individual scandal rather than structural condition: a rogue hacker, a bad apple, a breached database.  The systemic trade in vulnerability remains invisible because it lacks protagonists.  Survivor narratives that expose it are often dismissed as “too emotional” or “conspiratorial.”  The consequence is epistemic containment—the same story, retold until resistance seems implausible.

In response, counter-cultures have begun to weaponise aesthetics: zines, glitch art, encrypted archives.  These practices treat opacity as care, reminding that withdrawal from the gaze can itself be an act of love.

6. Moral Economy of Shame

Surveillance depends on shame to police its borders.  When leaked nudes circulate, outrage targets the subject, not the infrastructure that allowed the leak.  When welfare recipients are algorithmically profiled as potential fraudsters, the stigma of poverty deflects critique from the system that profited from their data.  This redistribution of blame is cultural engineering: it keeps the market stable by convincing the exploited that their exposure is their fault. [13]

Sex work again provides the mirror.  The worker is vilified for selling access to her body, yet the platform executive is lauded for selling access to billions of bodies at once.  The only difference is scale and the story told about consent.

7. The Loop Closes

By entwining visibility with virtue, culture ensures that extraction feels voluntary.  The brothel of data requires no guards when the clients believe they are guests.  The cultural imagination supplies the velvet wallpaper, the soundtrack, the perfume of empowerment.  And so long as people confuse surveillance with belonging, the pimp need not raise his voice.

Part III — Infrastructure as Desire

Culture primes the appetite; infrastructure feeds it. What begins as a fascination with visibility hardens into machinery.  The cloud, the camera, and the algorithm are no longer tools of administration—they are architectures of longing, built to capture the pulse of collective fear and want.

1. From Convenience to Command

Every technical convenience carries a clause of obedience.  The phone that unlocks with a glance, the sensor that learns the body’s rhythm, the “smart” door that reports entry times—each promises mastery through comfort.  Behind the promise sits an economy that converts private life into logistical metadata.  The physical apparatus of surveillance—data centres, fibre cables, undersea switches—constitutes the most extensive industrial complex on earth after energy. And like energy, it is framed as infrastructure too essential to question. [14]

2. Cloud Empire

A handful of cloud providers—AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud—host the majority of the world’s public-sector information.  Government contracts are awarded for efficiency, yet these partnerships create a dependency that rivals colonial concession.  Once a national archive, welfare system, or hospital dataset lives in a private cloud, sovereignty is leased. [15]

In the U.K., the Palantir NHS Federated Data Platform demonstrates the pattern.  Officially, the project unifies patient information “to improve outcomes.”  In reality, it embeds a U.S. defence contractor at the heart of public health infrastructure. The NHS remains the face of trust; Palantir supplies the predictive core.  When citizens protest, ministers assure that “all data stays within the NHS,” eliding that the algorithms and storage belong elsewhere. What looks like partnership is a new form of extractive tenancy. [16]

3. Predictive Policing

Commercial predictive-policing platforms—COMPAS, PredPol (now Geolitica), Palantir Gotham—promise foresight: where crime will occur, who will reoffend, which street requires patrols. The data feeding these systems come from decades of racially skewed policing.  The model learns bias as truth, then re-projects it as risk. Each arrest becomes a training label that justifies the next. Police chiefs call this “intelligence-led policing.” It is, more accurately, the automation of prejudice. [17]

A 2016 ProPublica investigation showed that COMPAS misclassified Black defendants as “high risk” at twice the rate of white defendants who did not reoffend. When challenged, the vendor claimed trade secrecy. Courts accepted the algorithm’s opacity as proprietary right. Thus the infrastructure protects itself by design; transparency ends at the interface of profit.

4. Welfare Scoring and Poverty Prediction

The same logic governs welfare systems. In the Netherlands, the SyRI program combined tax, employment, and housing data to flag potential benefit fraud. An independent tribunal found the system discriminatory and unlawful in 2020, yet similar models operate across Europe under new names. [18]  In the U.K., local councils experiment with “child-risk prediction” software sold as safeguarding tools. False positives fracture families; the supplier calls it error margin.

Virginia Eubanks describes this process as digital poorhouses—infrastructures that translate poverty into data and data into discipline. Each line of code replaces social work with suspicion. Each procurement cycle deepens dependency on the very systems that manufacture risk. The vulnerable pay twice: once through taxation, again through exposure. [19]

5. Biometric Frontiers

Borders and welfare offices increasingly share suppliers. Facial-recognition systems developed for counter-terrorism migrate into visa and benefits screening. Iris-scanners in refugee camps feed databases accessible to military and humanitarian agencies alike. Under the rhetoric of identity management, these technologies transform movement and survival into traceable commodities. Once collected, biometric data are almost impossible to delete. Bodies become permanent passwords. [20]

The market for such identification systems is booming. By 2024, analysts value it at over $50 billion globally. That figure represents more than hardware—it is the price of consent abstracted from the person.

6. Desire as Governance

Why does this infrastructure persist despite scandal? Because it fulfils a cultural desire for certainty. The promise of prediction seduces both rulers and ruled. Governments crave pre-emption; citizens crave reassurance. The algorithm becomes an oracle that transforms anxiety into policy. Each new crisis—terrorism, migration, pandemic—expands the oracle’s remit. Data centres are the modern temples: humming, cooled, unseen. Their priests are data scientists whose models translate chaos into numbers that look like safety. [21]

7. The Moral Displacement Loop

Every networked system displaces accountability downward. When predictive policing yields biased arrests, officials blame “bad data.” When welfare algorithms cut benefits, ministers blame automation. Responsibility dissolves into infrastructure. The system is never wrong—only its inputs. This logic mirrors the oldest moral trade of exploitation: the body is to blame for the use made of it. Surveillance infrastructure repeats that theology at scale.

8. Owning the Means of Perception

Karl Marx wrote that revolution requires seizing the means of production. In the data century, emancipation demands seizing the means of perception. Whoever controls the sensors, servers, and sorting functions controls how reality appears. Current infrastructure ensures that perception itself is privatised. The map no longer describes the territory; it bills for access. Until the instruments of seeing are socialised—through public ownership, open standards, or collective refusal—every act of visibility will feed the market it seeks to resist. [22]

Part IV — Selling Off the Vulnerable: Datasets as Flesh

Every empire finds a way to turn people into assets.  In the data empire, that transformation is called collection.  The phrase is tidy, administrative, and morally neutral.  Behind it sits the same logic that once measured bodies by height and productivity: those deemed dependent, ill, poor, or displaced are the easiest to number.

1. From Case Files to Commodities

Welfare, health, and asylum systems generate the most intimate records a state can hold.  When governments outsource data management, those records become product lines.  Contract registers show entire populations traded as “datasets” between agencies and contractors.  Tender documents refer to risk-intelligence portfolios and vulnerability mapping services—bureaucratic euphemisms for lists of lives in precarity. [23]

Humanitarian data projects, too, slide into this market.  In 2019, UN agencies admitted that refugee-registration databases hosted by private firms had been accessed by third parties for “analytics support.”  The justification was efficiency; the result was traceability without refuge. [24]

2. The Economics of Exposure

Why target the vulnerable?  Because their data are rich and cheap.  Marginalised communities interact constantly with public services: hospitals, housing offices, social-care portals.  Each interaction generates structured data—age, diagnosis, income, location—perfect for predictive modelling.  The subjects rarely have the resources to refuse consent or litigate misuse.  Data brokers call this high-value segmentation.  Ethicists call it exploitation. [25]

The trade echoes older economies of the body.  Nineteenth-century anatomists purchased cadavers from workhouses; twenty-first-century analysts purchase datasets from welfare departments.  In both cases, poverty supplies the raw material for knowledge and profit.

3. Charity and Extraction

Even benevolence has become a vector of commodification.  Charities gather sensitive data through crisis hotlines, food-bank registries, and mental-health apps.  Some later partner with analytics firms to “improve service delivery.”  Donors imagine they fund compassion; in practice they fund pipelines.  Once digitised, compassion behaves like any other extractive asset: it scales. [26]

The logic of philanthro-capitalism—doing well by doing good—normalises this trade.  Every download of a wellness app adds another entry to a behavioural dataset that can be licensed to insurers or advertisers.  The more someone suffers, the more data they emit; the more data, the higher the valuation.

4. Biometrics and the Permanent Record

Biometric registration of refugees, prisoners, and aid recipients is now routine.  A fingerprint becomes a ration card; an iris scan becomes a gate pass.  These systems rarely include sunset clauses.  Once collected, the template persists indefinitely in global databases.  NGOs speak of “protection”; vendors speak of “identity solutions.”  The human becomes a persistent identifier—an embodied username. [27]

In 2022 the Biometrics and Refugee Protection report noted that private-sector contractors maintained mirror copies of humanitarian databases “for testing.”  No one could confirm deletion.  Data immortality is marketed as reliability.

5. Trauma as Product

Psychological and medical data form a particularly lucrative niche.  Platforms that host online therapy or crisis chatlines store transcripts that can be mined for linguistic markers of distress.  Some firms resell anonymised versions to marketing and sentiment-analysis companies.  The resulting models predict not just what people buy, but when they break. [28]

The moral line between care and capture dissolves.  Each upload of pain feeds a market that treats suffering as signal.  The more articulate the confession, the cleaner the dataset.

6. From Statistics to Sovereignty

When datasets of vulnerable people are sold, something larger than privacy is lost: jurisdiction over selfhood.  Control of representation—who tells the story of a life—moves from the subject to the buyer.  Governments that privatise social-service databases cede not just infrastructure but narrative authority.  The map begins to define the territory.  A predictive welfare model can determine which borough receives funding, who is flagged as risky, and which neighbourhoods are policed.  Data becomes destiny. [29]

7. The Legal Blind Spot

International law recognises trafficking in persons but not trafficking in personal data.  The UN Palermo Protocol defines exploitation in physical terms.  Yet the same harms—loss of agency, coercion, profit from vulnerability—occur in digital form.  Until data-trafficking acquires legal standing equivalent to human trafficking, the trade will remain invisible to criminal law. [30]

8. Equivalence

To call dataset sales “modern slavery” risks rhetorical inflation, yet the structural resemblance is undeniable: a market in lives whose consent is presumed, whose value lies in labour or risk, and whose buyers claim benevolence.  When ministries auction access to social-care data or allow predictive analytics on trauma archives, they participate in a commerce of souls.  The distance between flesh and file is administrative, not moral.

Part V — Refusal and Sovereignty

If surveillance is the new pimp, then refusal is not abstinence—it is revolt.  It means reclaiming the right to opacity, to non-compliance, to disappear without penalty.  In a system that measures worth by visibility, choosing silence becomes an act of authorship.

1. From Transparency to Tactics

Western democracies sanctify transparency.  Yet transparency inverts easily into control: the ruled are visible; the rulers remain opaque.  The demand for open data, open government, and open science often disguises a one-way mirror.  Philosopher Édouard Glissant described the right to opacity as a condition of dignity—the right not to be fully known. [31]  In the data state, this right must be rebuilt in code and in law.

Refusal begins with small tactics: ad-blockers, encryption, pseudonyms, obfuscation.  These gestures slow extraction, reminding that consent can still be withdrawn at the interface.  But tactical refusal must mature into structural change.

2. Legal Reclamation

Regulators already possess the tools; they lack the teeth.  GDPR’s Article 17 promises the right to erasure, yet enforcement remains symbolic.  A genuine reclamation would fund data-protection authorities at parity with corporate compliance budgets and grant collective redress so communities, not just individuals, can demand deletion.  The forthcoming EU AI Act could become a precedent if its human-rights provisions gain binding force.  At present, they read like etiquette. [32]

Across the Atlantic, class-action suits against spyware vendors have begun to pierce the corporate veil.  U.S. courts accepted jurisdiction over NSO Group in 2023 after years of diplomatic shielding, signalling that human-rights law can reach digital traffickers. [33]  Each ruling is a small re-entry of morality into code.

3. Procurement as Policy

Most state extraction happens through contracts, not coups.  Changing procurement rules—requiring human-rights impact assessments, survivor consultation, and full disclosure of subcontractors—would cut the oxygen to exploitative systems.  Governments could refuse bids from companies under investigation for privacy violations or misuse of surveillance tech.  Procurement is not paperwork; it is power. [34]

4. Survivor Governance

Nothing about us without us must apply to data governance.  Survivors of institutional harm, patients, migrants, and marginalised communities hold experiential knowledge absent from policy boards.  Embedding them with voting rights in oversight bodies converts testimony into authority.  The Norwegian Data Ethics Council’s 2024 pilot included citizens drawn by lottery to review algorithmic systems; it proved deliberation can coexist with expertise. [35]

When the governed participate directly in the design and audit of data systems, refusal becomes constructive.  The goal is not to freeze technology but to civilise it by consent.

5. Sovereign Syntax

Language itself is infrastructure.  Every form we fill, every dataset label, every term like user, subject, beneficiary, encodes hierarchy.  Rewriting those terms is an act of jurisdiction.  The sentence “the system captured the patient’s voice” could as easily read “the patient granted a fragment of her voice to the system”—a shift from capture to credit.  When communities reclaim authorship of their descriptors, they re-enter legal space as speakers, not specimens. [36]

6. Public Refusal and Naming

Naming remains a weapon of last resort.  When investigation and diplomacy fail, public exposure restores equilibrium.  The blacklisting of NSO Group by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2021 curtailed sales worldwide.  Similar pressure forced Palantir to open portions of its NHS contract for scrutiny.  Shame, once a tool of oppression, can be repurposed as accountability. [37]

7. The Ethics of Withholding

Refusal is often caricatured as nihilism—an anti-innovation posture.  In truth, withholding data can be profoundly ethical.  Feminist technologists speak of careful data: the practice of collecting less, slower, and only with relational consent.  To design with care is to design against extraction. [38]  The same impulse that closes a window against the cold can close an API against surveillance.

8. Re-sovereigntising the Everyday

Refusal scales through habit.  A collective of artists encrypting their archives, a clinic deciding not to store diagnostic audio, a council deleting redundant CCTV—all these acts restore proportion between human and system.  Each instance proves sovereignty is granular; it begins wherever someone decides that enough visibility is enough.

The ambition of Polaris and projects like it is to document those small sovereignties until they form a constellation of precedent—evidence that liberation in the digital age looks less like revolt and more like deliberate maintenance.

Closing — The Manifesto: Moral Men Don’t Sell Souls

This is not an invitation to incremental reform.  It is an indictment.  Selling datasets of the vulnerable is the polite name for trafficking in people.  The practice survives only because law and culture have disguised appetite as administration.  The bureaucrat’s spreadsheet and the broker’s dashboard perform the same task as the trafficker’s ledger: converting life into countable inventory.  To call it data rather than flesh is a difference of syntax, not ethics.

Governments, corporations, and institutions that purchase or host such information cannot plead neutrality.  When your servers store biometric registries of refugees, you are not simply “providing cloud capacity.”  When your analytics model profits from health crises or predictive policing contracts, you are not a bystander.  You are a beneficiary of dispossession.

The corrective is not pity but principle.  A society that still claims moral authority must draw one clear line: the soul is not for sale.  The vulnerability of others is not a resource, and no spreadsheet will launder that sin.  Refusal is the only form of participation left that does not reproduce the market.

To those who design, legislate, or invest in these systems: look closely at what you build.  The database that makes a refugee traceable may one day map you too.  The model that quantifies distress will eventually be trained on your own.  Empires of visibility always consume their architects.  Stop before that recursion completes.

Moral men don’t sell souls.

Afterword — The Return of the Whole

Even after so much has been stripped for parts, the human remains astonishingly repairable.  People keep reaching toward each other across algorithmic glass—writing, singing, building networks of mutual care.  That persistence is proof that dignity is not a finite resource; it re-emerges wherever someone refuses to treat another as data.

To document harm is to begin healing it.  Each survivor-led archive, each act of witness, restitches what the extraction economy tried to unmake.  The task is not nostalgia but reconstruction: to remember that breath, voice, and story were never divisible.

Polaris, and every constellation like it, stands as quiet defiance.  It says that meaning can be rebuilt, that even in systems designed for capture there is room for grace.  The sweetness lives in that refusal—to keep something sacred, to stay human in a machine that calls humanity noise.
