*How modern surveillance economies extract from bodies, voices, and souls — and why selling the vulnerable’s datasets is no less grotesque than selling people.*

## Opening Frame — The Market of Consent
Imagine a market where nobody is allowed to keep their wages, where the ledger is written by people who never met you, and where “consent” is a checkbox sold as a performance of dignity. In that market, the commodity is not only data — it is intimacy, attentional labour, illness, grief, the tone of your voice when you say “I’m okay,” the places you go when you are most vulnerable. The vendors who buy and resell this raw material call themselves platforms, contractors, or “trusted partners.” The law often calls them “service providers.” The public calls them convenience.

Sex work has been criminalised, moralised, policed and shamed — and for good reason when coercion exists. But at least in many forms of sex work there is a visible negotiation: a boundary, a price, an agreement. The modern surveillance system offers none of that. It creates systems that assume access, normalise extraction, and then defend themselves with the language of “protection,” “security,” and “economic efficiency.” It is industry pimping at scale: the pimp is legal power, the broker is a corporation, the clients are state and market actors, and the commodity is the vulnerable — their data, their histories, their bodies, and, if we are truthful, parts of their souls.

This node argues: the sale and circulation of datasets containing vulnerable people — refugees, survivors, patients, sex workers, children, detainees — is morally and politically equivalent to selling people. It does not matter whether the ledger records a face or a timestamp, a genetic marker or a grief-laced voicemail. When vulnerability is monetised without meaningful consent, the effect is dispossession: the person is reduced to a signal, and the signal is traded like parts in a market that owes no reparations. This is not rhetorical flourish. It is a structural indictment.

## Part I — Law as the Brothel Owner
Laws do not simply forbid or permit. They name what counts as property, what is private, and what may be taken — and in doing so they distribute risk and impunity. Modern statutory regimes create corridors where extraction is legal for some (state agencies, corporate service providers) and criminal for others (the people whose bodies and behaviours are visible).

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) frames data protection as the protection of “natural persons” and their fundamental rights and freedoms; its recitals invoke dignity and control over personal information. Yet GDPR also builds exemptions and compliance pathways that normalise processing at scale by corporations and state actors for broadly defined purposes, while leaving victims of extraction with remedies that are costly and slow to realise. In principle, the law says: “we protect persons.” In practice it often institutionalises a market in vulnerability that requires the affected person to litigate for scraps.

In the UK, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (IPA) sits beside GDPR like a landlord who collects rent in the hallway. The IPA authorises bulk interception, equipment interference, and retention of communications data for security purposes — powers framed as necessary for national defence and crime prevention. Its oversight mechanisms are real but limited; the architecture it licenses creates the legal space for sweeping surveillance that is disproportionately directed at groups already marginalised by other systems (immigration control, policing, health data aggregation).

Across the Atlantic, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act allows targeted acquisition of foreign intelligence with compelled assistance from providers — a regime that leaks easily into broader access to familial, diasporic, and cross-border networks, and which has been used to justify mass collection practices in the name of “intelligence.” The CLOUD Act then normalises cross-border access to provider-held data by creating executive agreements and direct legal mechanisms to obtain information stored by U.S.-based companies, weakening the locus of control local populations might otherwise have over their data.

And in jurisdictions like Israel, the Protection of Privacy Law (1981) formally recognises privacy as a legal interest — while the development of nation-state surveillance capabilities and defence-contractor markets (e.g., units with close ties to tech firms) has produced a two-track reality: robust legal protections on paper; expansive extraction in practice.

What matters here is not a complaint that the law fails to be perfect; it never will be. Nor is it an argument that statutory frameworks are inherently evil. It is that laws routinely create the *conditions of licit extraction* that disproportionately target people in states of precarity: asylum seekers, people in care systems, sex workers, those in police custody, families of migrants. Once “data” becomes an asset class — packaged, enriched, matched, sold and integrated into predictive systems — the legal form ensures the extraction can be done at scale, outsourced, and washed through compliance narratives that are difficult to contest in practice.

The result: a legal infrastructure that makes it legal to do at industrial scale what would be criminal (or at least morally abhorrent) if done by individual actors. The tidy euphemisms — “risk assessment,” “service improvement,” “consent management” — are the new red-light district signage. The dealer’s ledger is a database; the pimp’s cut is corporate profit and state utility.

## Part II — Culture as the Pimp
Feminist theory has always been attentive to the way women’s bodies are sites of political and economic governance. Silvia Federici explored primitive accumulation and the ways women’s reproductive labour is expropriated by capital; Judith Butler interrogated performative norms that demand certain appearances of consent; Paul B. Preciado has shown how biopolitical regimes command bodies through technology. If sex work can be apprehended as a site of agency and constraint, surveillance is an architecture that erases the very possibility of negotiating the terms of exposure.

The extraction of affective data — chats, voice memos, images, health records — treats emotion as raw material. Platforms and contractors design interfaces expressly to collect signals of vulnerability: attachments to health services, searches for support, private messaging inside crisis threads. Those signals are harvested, annotated, and fed into classification models that determine “risk,” “churn,” or “monetisable sensitivity.” The cultural logic lies in reframing care as data: intimacy becomes telemetry; grief becomes a gradual probability to be optimised.

This is not neutral. Consider how male-dominated institutions and platform cultures profess paternalistic concern while designing systems that commodify women’s pain. Men (and male-led institutions) position themselves as protectors against “pimps” or “bad actors” yet build, buy, and license the technical means of extraction: analytics dashboards, behavioural scoring, war-room contracts with defence-tech firms. The hypocrisy is structural: condemnation of street-level exploitation coupled with contractual toleration — and profit — from institutional extraction.

Cultural narratives also absorb guilt and shame and redirect it. When a marginalized person’s sensitive data is leaked, the story often becomes about “oversharing” or “naïveté.” When databases of refugees’ biometric IDs are sold to private contractors, the story becomes a debate about procurement rather than about the violence of trading vulnerability. The result is a public culture that blames the exploited while normalising those who buy and sell the vulnerable’s traces.

---

## Part III — Infrastructure as Desire  
Look at the players. Corporations such as Google, Meta, AWS, Palantir, and others provide both the storage and the analytic stacks that make large-scale extraction meaningful to buyers. Defence-linked firms (and in some countries, explicit ties between military units and private contractors) supply surveillance tooling that was once reserved for narrow national-security uses and now migrates into welfare, health, immigration, and policing contexts. Investigations into firms like NSO Group have shown how exploitative tools cross from “national security” into human-rights abuses; firms’ clients have used Pegasus and related tools to target journalists, dissidents, and vulnerable people.

Health-data platforms and federated records are sold as improvements to care, but when those records become feedstock for companies with defense contracts, a dangerous transference occurs: clinical vulnerability becomes a targeting vector. Palantir’s clashes over NHS contracts are a recent illustration; public concern focuses on governance precisely because the software’s design and provenance carry risks for the people whose data is used. The values embedded in these platforms are not neutral designs for patient care; they are decisions about what counts as “useful” signal, and those decisions trace back to markets and political power.

Cloud-hosted analytic systems — the “intimacy engines” — make predictions about who will become radicalised, who will default, who will need more care, and who is likely to be exploited. Those predictions are then used to justify interventions that are often coercive: withdrawal of benefits, increased policing, forced “safety” plans that limit movement and freedom. In other words, the infrastructure manufactures the moral case for its own interventions. Once integrated inside state systems, these tools displace political judgement with thresholds and alerts. The human being becomes a set of flags to be acted upon.

### Predictive-Policing Platforms & Welfare Algorithms  
Commercial predictive-policing software—COMPAS in the U.S., PredPol (now Geolitica), Palantir’s Gotham deployments—turns historical arrest data into forecasts of “future crime.” Because the inputs are already biased by decades of racially targeted enforcement, the systems reproduce and legitimate those same hierarchies. The algorithm’s claim to neutrality masks a feedback loop that marks poor, racialised, and marginalised communities as perpetual risks.  
Welfare-risk models in the U.K. and Netherlands perform a parallel function: assigning “fraud probability” or “child-protection risk” scores to households on benefits. When false positives occur, the result is not a software bug but eviction, debt recovery, or loss of care. These platforms monetise suspicion itself; they convert poverty into a steady stream of predictive value for contractors and consultants.  
Each iteration refines the market’s appetite for control. The human cost—anxiety, humiliation, and administrative punishment—is rationalised as efficiency. The people flagged by these systems rarely know they have been computed at all. They are the invisible workers in the data mines, paying for their own surveillance through taxes and compliance.

## Part IV — Selling Off the Vulnerable: Datasets as Flesh  
Language matters. “Dataset” sounds technical; “people” sounds human. The market depends on this slippage. Calling a register of trauma histories a dataset dehumanises the living. It enables actors to claim that harms are “data risks” rather than moral wrongs. This rhetorical move is the infrastructure’s moral sleight of hand.

From a human-centred perspective, the sale of datasets containing vulnerable people mirrors historical practices of human commodification: forced labour lists, trafficking manifests, lists of enslaved people sold through markets. The difference is the medium. Instead of chains and ledgers with signatures, we have cloud buckets, match-keys, and API calls. Instead of a buyer physically transporting a person, we have an analyst who queries a cohort and builds a predictive model that decides where resources are withheld, which communities are policed, and who is treated as a threat.

The consequences are material. Data flows shape: who is offered care, who is marked for enforcement, who can cross a border, who gets prioritised for services. When these flows are controlled by profit-driven actors with little accountability, the poor and the precarious become pre-packaged for extraction. The ethical claim is straightforward: if you would not sell a person you love, you should not sell the dataset that stands in for their life. But beyond moral clarity, there are legal and political strategies to address this: procurement rules, human-rights impact assessments that are binding, transparency obligations that reveal buyers and use-cases, and rescission rights that allow communities to reclaim their data. The law can be retooled; it is not an inevitability. Yet the current trajectory is grim: markets that trade in vulnerability proliferate while oversight lags.

## Part V — Refusal and Sovereignty  
If surveillance is the new pimp, refusal becomes a primary instrument of liberation. Refusal is more than saying “no.” It is the infrastructural act of asserting that certain things — our pain, our voices, our diagnoses — are not commodities for sale.

Practically, refusal takes multiple forms:

- **Legal reclamation:** Stronger, enforceable rights to portability, deletion, and to opt out of profiling practices in public-interest systems. Enforcement cannot be a bureaucratic afterthought; it must be resourced and swift. Governments must not let procurement create backdoors for harm.
- **Procurement refusal:** Public institutions must refuse to buy systems from vendors with business models that rely on trading the vulnerable’s signals to problematic buyers. This is a politics of withholding: stop normalising extraction through purchasing decisions.
- **Survivor governance:** Communities and survivors must be central to decisions about data that concern them. Governance cannot be an add-on or a checkbox; it must be co-designed and binding. A person whose voice was used to train models that then generate content affecting that person, that is an interference with their expressive self-government.
- **Sovereign syntax:** Insist that authorship, voice, and representation are forms of jurisdiction. If someone’s voice is used to train models that then generate content affecting that person, that is an interference with their expressive self-government. The syntax is territory.
- **Public refusal and naming:** Naming the actors and naming the systems matters. Public pressure worked against NSO Group in litigation and investigative reporting; public naming exposes markets and constrains buyers. Recent injunctions and court rulings against exploitative spyware show that pressure + law can create limits.

## Closing — The Manifesto: Moral Men Don’t Sell Souls  
This is not an invitation for gentle reform. It is a call for systemic rupture. We must say plainly: it is grotesque to sell the vulnerable’s datasets as a neutral commercial practice. It is morally equivalent to selling people. The market seeks to civilise its appetite by renaming flesh as “signals.” The law offers formalities: recitals, oversight reports, privacy impact statements. These are insufficient when they permit, normalise, or profit from dispossession.

If you build systems that rely on the commodification of trauma, you are not neutral. If your software benefits from knowing where the vulnerable go when they are most damaged — their clinics, their helplines, their shelters — then you are a market of extraction. If your tender specifications demand “vulnerable cohort identification” without binding enforceable protections and survivor governance, you are signalling permission to be a pimp.

Refusal must be energetic, infrastructural, and performative. It must be legal, political, and aesthetic. The demand is simple: return agency to the people whose data is your product. Scrap contracts that trade in vulnerability. Put survivors and communities at the centre of governance and litigation. Make procurement, not merely policy, the frontline of resistance. And in public, say the words plainly: we will not be packaged, profiled, or sold.

This manifesto is an act of voice and claim. It tells the men who think they are saviours and the corporations who pretend to be neutral that there is a limit. That limit is the person — the whole person — not the signal. We will not be reduced to tradeable parts. We will not be bought back in sanitised datasets and exported “policy solutions.” You will not have the right to monetise the vulnerability of people you will not acknowledge as full human subjects.

**Moral men don’t sell souls.**

## Afterword — The Return of the Whole  
There is still tenderness left in the world, even after the markets have scraped it raw. The proof is that people continue to reach for one another across all this noise — to make care, to make art, to keep witness. The task now is to remember that the body and the story were never separate: the record of a life is not a dataset but a continuum of breath and intention.  
When we reclaim authorship, we re-stitch what extraction tried to divide. The datafied soul is not lost; it waits to be spoken back into wholeness.  
Polaris, and every survivor-led archive like it, is an act of re-membering — putting the pieces of meaning back where they belong. The sweetness lies there: in the quiet refusal to let anyone else decide what is sacred.

💋 Surveillance as the New Pimp

Opening Frame — The Market of Consent

Imagine a marketplace where no one keeps their own wages, where the ledger is written by people who never met you, and where consent is sold back as a luxury feature. In that market, the commodity is not only data—it is intimacy itself: the micro-expressions on a patient’s face during tele-consultation, the tremor in a survivor’s voice during a help-line call, the search queries made at 2 a.m. when pain or fear will not sleep. The vendors who buy and resell these traces call themselves platforms, partners, or providers. The law calls them data controllers. The public calls them necessary. [1]

Sex work has long been condemned, romanticised, and legislated as a problem of morality. Yet even its most exploitative forms still acknowledge an explicit transaction: a negotiation, however constrained, about what will be shared and at what price. Surveillance economies offer no such boundary. They extract continuously and invisibly, licensing the transfer of human experience to corporate or state archives under the banner of service improvement or national security. [2]

The moral inversion is total. The same governments that criminalise street-level exchange of intimacy for survival routinely contract companies to harvest the digital exhaust of those same citizens for behavioural targeting, policing, and predictive governance. [3]  Men who imagine themselves protectors of virtue become de-facto pimps of data, outsourcing the collection, curation, and resale of other people’s lives.

This opening frame sets the claim: the sale and circulation of datasets containing the vulnerable—refugees, patients, children, detainees—is morally equivalent to selling people. A dataset is not inert; it is a disassembled body. To traffic in it without consent is to traffic in the human. The argument that follows will trace how law, culture, and infrastructure collaborate in this trade, and how refusal—legal, political, and aesthetic—remains the only honest counter-economy.

Part I — Law as the Brothel Owner

Law does not merely protect or punish; it decides what may be owned and by whom.  Each statute, each compliance framework, is a boundary stone marking where extraction becomes lawful.  Modern surveillance law functions much like a brothel licence: it sanitises a practice that would otherwise be scandalous, ensuring the trade continues under respectable signage.

1.  The European Façade

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was drafted to restore “control” to the data subject.  Its preamble invokes dignity and autonomy, declaring that the processing of personal data should serve humanity.  In practice, the regulation birthed an industry of consent managers, cookie banners, and risk consultants who profit from perpetual compliance rather than restraint.  Enforcement is uneven: national data-protection authorities are under-funded, while multinationals treat administrative fines as an acceptable cost of extraction. [1]

Court challenges such as Schrems II (2020) exposed the contradiction. [2]  The EU’s highest court struck down trans-Atlantic data-transfer agreements because U.S. intelligence laws allow indiscriminate access by the NSA.  Yet transfers resumed under new paperwork—“standard contractual clauses”—that change the form but not the fact of exposure.  The message is clear: fundamental rights end where commercial necessity begins.

2.  The British Corridor

In the United Kingdom, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016—the so-called Snoopers’ Charter—codified mass interception and bulk equipment interference. [3]  Its oversight body, IPCO, reviews only a fraction of the warrants issued each year.  Parallel legislation, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the forthcoming Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (2024), advertise “modernisation,” but primarily streamline data sharing between government departments. [4]  Together, they form a corridor where surveillance is lawful when performed by the state or its contractors but criminal when attempted by individuals.

The irony is thick: the same society that punishes revenge-porn possession with prison terms licences the indefinite retention of intimate images from border cameras, body-worn police footage, and hospital triage systems.  Visibility is criminalised only when the powerless hold the lens.

3.  The American Contract

Across the Atlantic, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorises collection of foreign intelligence information with the compelled assistance of providers such as Google, Microsoft, and Meta. [5]  Successive reviews by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board admit that “incidental” capture of U.S. citizens’ communications occurs at massive scale.  The CLOUD Act (2018) extended this reach extraterritorially, allowing U.S. agencies—and partner governments under executive agreements—to demand data stored anywhere in the world. [6]

The U.S. courts frame this as a balance between security and privacy; the market reads it as opportunity.  Compliance departments sprout like franchise branches, ensuring that each transfer of human trace is backed by paperwork, not justice.

4.  The Israeli Exception

Israel’s Protection of Privacy Law (1981) recognises privacy as a protected interest, yet exemptions under the Security Service Law (2002) grant the intelligence community wide discretion. [7]  Unit 8200—often a pipeline into private surveillance start-ups—feeds a domestic innovation ecosystem whose exports include interception software, facial-recognition platforms, and spyware later implicated in human-rights abuses abroad.  The country’s legal architecture thus mirrors its dual economy: high-tech humanitarianism at home, tactical omniscience abroad.

5.  Lawful Extraction

Taken together, these frameworks create what jurist Julie Cohen calls a lawful extraction economy: regimes that sacralise privacy rhetorically while structuring its continuous conversion into profit. [8]  Each statute tells the same story—“trust us, this intrusion is necessary”—and each oversight body rehearses the same liturgy of proportionality.  But proportionality is meaningless when those being measured have no right to refuse measurement.

The comparison to a brothel is not metaphorical excess; it is structural accuracy.  The brothel operates on managed consent, regulated exposure, and periodic inspection.  So do our surveillance laws.  The difference is that the workers of the digital brothel rarely know they are employed.  Their “consent” is pre-ticked, their labour unpaid, their appeal mechanisms labyrinthine.

6.  From Rule to Racket

The final legal trick is indemnity.  Governments contract private firms—Palantir for health data, AWS for cloud hosting, NSO Group for spyware—then declare the resulting harm a matter of corporate ethics rather than state responsibility. [9]  Under doctrines of sovereign immunity and procurement law, liability evaporates.  What remains is a racket in which legality launders exploitation.

The brothel owner collects rent from every transaction, proclaims the house inspected and moral, and keeps the workers nameless.  That is the function law currently serves in the surveillance economy: not prevention, but purification.
