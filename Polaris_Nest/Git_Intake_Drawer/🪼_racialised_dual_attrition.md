# 👾 Racialised Dual-Attribution & Metadata Priority Bias  
**First created:** 2025-11-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-09  
*How identity-coded keywords accelerate institutional routing while bodily harm is deprioritised.*

---

## 🛰️ Purpose  
Maps why allegations relating to geopolitical optics (“dual loyalty,” “extremism,” “bias”) are routed faster and with higher severity than disclosures of rape, harassment, or record-breach.

---

## ✨ Core Questions  
- Why do *identity-coded accusations* outrank *survivor safety* in institutional response trees?  
- How do oversight systems calculate “risk to state optics”?  
- What metadata fields accelerate or decelerate routing?

---

## 📡 Mechanisms to Analyse  
- Priority keywords  
- Reputational triage  
- Security adjacency  
- Racialised oversight reflexes

## 🌌 Constellations
