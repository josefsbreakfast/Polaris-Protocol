# 🎛️ Pocket Rules — Survivor Voice Fidelity  

- Stay true to survivor’s own words.  
- Default to undertone (irony, bite, humanity woven in).  
- Record must be both forensic + alive.  
- Neutral pass only if explicitly asked.  
- Always cross-link suppression ↔ counter-nudge.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
