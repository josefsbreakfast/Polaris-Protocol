# 🧠 Extraction Loop — Data vs Story  
**First created:** 2025-11-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-08  
*A sketch of how systems can mine someone’s intellect while narrating them as “low ability”.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node maps how two things can coexist:  
1. Systems repeatedly *use* a person’s creative / analytical capability.  
2. The same systems maintain a story that the person is “stupid”, “manipulative”, or “not very capable”.  

The contradiction is resolved not by truth, but by power: data are used quietly; story is used publicly.

*Extraction Loop — Data vs Story* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how intellect can be mined while credibility is suppressed, forming the left half of the Extraction ↔ Reclamation cycle.
