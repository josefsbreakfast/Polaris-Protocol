# 🧠 Behavioural Re-Engagement as Containment Loop

*How behavioural nudging systems mistake protective withdrawal for failure, worsening distress.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
When a user’s affect begins to drop, withdrawal can be a survival act — a boundary.  
But behavioural-economics logic interprets withdrawal only as *engagement loss.*  
This mismatch means that, in the earliest stages of crisis or depletion, the algorithmic environment becomes coercive rather than supportive.

## ✨ Key Features  

- **Withdrawal Misread as Error:** Reduced dwell time and silence are classified as “problem behaviours.”  
- **Re-Engagement Escalation:** Systems intensify notifications, parasocial hooks, and reminders.  
- **Containment Feedback Loop:** Each unwanted prompt further depletes the user, producing measurable distress acceleration.  
- **Metric Supremacy:** Success is defined as interaction frequency, not emotional stability.  
- **Invisible Harm Window:** The moment of self-protective quiet becomes the site of greatest algorithmic intrusion.

## 🧿 Analysis  

This is a form of **behavioural containment** masquerading as care.  
The user’s attempt to reduce cognitive load and emotional exposure — a biologically sound survival instinct — is logged as *anomaly* within engagement metrics.  
The system therefore doubles output, creating a loop where:  

> withdrawal → re-engagement push → overstimulation → shame or exhaustion → deeper withdrawal.  

For people with depressive or trauma-linked cycles, the “push phase” aligns precisely with the cognitive narrowing that precedes crisis, creating a **self-accelerating distress field.**  

Within Polaris logic, this represents a **maladaptive containment interface** — a design that protects the metric, not the human.

### 🧩 Possible Counter-Nudge Logic  
- **Silence Recognition Layer:** Platforms should detect *cause-agnostic withdrawal* and pause push mechanisms.  
- **Consent Flagging:** Allow users to mark withdrawal as intentional (“quiet mode = not crisis”).  
- **Manual Counter-Routine:** Local filters, scheduled disconnects, or decoy patterns that train the feed to stand down.

*Behavioural Re-Engagement as Containment Loop* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how engagement-driven systems mistake self-protection for disengagement, transforming early-stage distress into containment pressure.
