*How manufactured provenance disproportionately affects registered professionals.*

---

## Risks
- Thin public provenance makes false claims plausible.  
- High-stakes complaints accepted before forensic checks.  
- Chilling effect: professionals withdraw from public discourse.

## Recommendations
- Unions issue member protection guidance.  
- Investigations require technical provenance before sanction.  
- Vendor contracts mandate preservation.  
- Provide support and rapid redress.  
- Train investigators on C3O.
