# üìì Field Log ‚Äî Network Instability & App Behaviour

**Observer:** [your initials/alias]  
**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Context:** Mobile app usage across WiFi and 5G, switching environments  
**Log Ref:** FL-2025-09-16-01

## Observations
- Multiple app inference issues recorded.  
- Noticeable lag during normal operation.  
- Several crashes observed.  
- Switching between **WiFi** and **5G** did not improve stability.  
- Connection improved when using a **VPN**.  

---

## Immediate Reactions
- VPN tunnelling may be bypassing throttling or packet-shaping measures.  
- Instability appears systemic, not device-specific.  
- Pattern resembles deliberate network interference or poor routing.  

---

## Hypotheses
1. **Throttling / shaping**: ISPs or intermediaries degrading service selectively.  
2. **App instability**: service-side inference handling under strain or poorly optimised.  
3. **Intentional disruption**: connection management influenced externally; VPN masks it.

## Cross-links
- [ ] Cluster 1 ‚Äî coercive control analogy (moving goalposts in service reliability).  
- [ ] Cluster 2 ‚Äî contractors profiting from ‚Äúmanaged disruption.‚Äù  
- [ ] Cluster 3 ‚Äî disinfo ops sustained by technical instability.  

---

### Notes to Self
- Capture timestamps and app logs where possible.  
- Test on a second device/OS for replication.  
- Correlate VPN provider endpoints with stability.
