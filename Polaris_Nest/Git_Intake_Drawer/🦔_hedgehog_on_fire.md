*A metaphor for trauma activation under cognitive overload and ambiguous safety*

## 🛰️ Orientation

Trauma responses are often described as emotional reactions.
In practice, they are frequently **mechanical contractions** triggered by
pattern recognition rather than conscious interpretation.

“Hedgehog on fire” is a shorthand for a specific state:
rapid defensive activation in the absence of clear threat,
driven by overload, ambiguity, and loss of interpretive margin.

This node names that state without pathologising it.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Activation precedes conscious thought.
- Defence is structural, not emotional.
- The response is protective, not maladaptive.
- Confusion is a stronger trigger than danger.
- Release requires clarity, not argument.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content

### 1) Why the hedgehog
A hedgehog does not curl because it evaluates danger.
It curls because a specialised ring of muscle contracts reflexively.

The action is:
- automatic,
- protective,
- ancient,
- and pre-cognitive.

This makes it a useful metaphor for trauma activation that occurs
before meaning is assigned.

---

### 2) What “on fire” signifies
“On fire” does not indicate panic or collapse.
It indicates **sympathetic nervous system dominance** under load.

Common conditions include:
- sustained ambiguity,
- interpretive overload,
- competing signals of safety and risk,
- lack of relational feedback,
- prolonged vigilance without resolution.

The system contracts and heats simultaneously.

---

### 3) Why safety does not immediately help
When the hedgehog is contracted, information arrives too late.

Reassurance, logic, or explanation:
- may be true,
- may be understood,
- but cannot undo a contraction already in progress.

Release occurs when:
- margin is restored,
- load decreases,
- or the environment becomes legible again.

---

### 4) Difference from threat response
| Threat response | Hedgehog on fire |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Triggered by danger | Triggered by overload |
| Actor-driven | Environment-driven |
| Escalatory | Self-limiting |
| Requires defence | Requires decompression |

Misclassifying this state as fear or paranoia increases distress.

---

### 5) Why this state is exhausting
A hedgehog on fire cannot:
- explore,
- interpret nuance,
- or tolerate uncertainty.

All resources are diverted to containment.
This is why the experience is often described as burnout rather than fear.

---

### 6) Why naming it helps
Naming the state:
- separates response from reality,
- restores adult interpretive authority,
- and shortens the activation window.

The hedgehog does not need to be fixed.
It needs space to uncoil.

Hedgehog on Fire is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents a common trauma activation pattern characterised by
protective contraction under ambiguity and cognitive load.
