# 🧿 Triangulation via Anonymous Metadata  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*How pseudonymised data from different agencies fuses into a single shadow identity.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Multi-agency hubs claim to handle “anonymous information.”  
In reality, behavioural fingerprints, trauma patterns, demographic hints, and timing alignments reconstruct the person.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Behavioural re-identification.  
- Shadow-profile formation across agencies.  
- Metadata fusion and pattern alignment.  
- Failure to recognise structural re-identification.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### **1. Anonymous in Name Only**  
Pseudonymised IDs contain behavioural and contextual metadata.  
This is enough to rebuild the person.

### **2. Pattern-Matching Is the Real Identifier**  
Three fragments = one person.  
This is re-identification by inference.

### **3. The Shadow Person**  
Once fragments collapse, the system maintains:  
- a persistent risk narrative  
- a pseudo-history  
- a merged vulnerability timeline
