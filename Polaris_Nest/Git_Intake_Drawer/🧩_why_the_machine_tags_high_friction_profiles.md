# 🧩 Why the Machine Tags High-Friction Profiles  
**First created:** 2025-11-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-05  
*How optimisation systems decide that certain humans are “difficult data.”*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
A “high-friction” tag rarely means misconduct.  
It’s a numerical confession from the system: *this profile doesn’t fit our statistical comfort zone.*  
The flag marks where automated confidence ends and human oversight should begin.

## 🧮 Core Mechanics  

| Signal | Why It Trips the Model | Human Meaning |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Data gaps / opacity** | Missing or classified fields reduce model confidence. | “We can’t see enough to predict safely.” |
| **Cross-domain identity** | Finance + academia + defence, etc. → violates expected career patterns. | Complexity misread as inconsistency. |
| **Contradictory language vectors** | Mixed descriptors (“activist” + “advisor”) lower semantic coherence. | A plural identity looks unstable. |
| **Dense heterogeneous networks** | Links across policy, business, NGOs. | Influence without visibility triggers caution. |
| **Rapid change / high derivative** | Frequent updates or relocations. | Algorithm reads adaptability as volatility. |

## 🧭 Interpretation  
To humans: **high friction = needs contextual review.**  
To machines: **high friction = slow the pipeline.**  
Understanding that difference is the first safeguard against invisible containment.

When the machine marks a person as frictional, it’s asking for a human conversation it cannot conduct.
