# 📋 Dual-Officer Clarification Request  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*Joint enquiry template requiring both the legal-governance and data-protection officers to confirm authority for any data-restriction or security mark.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
When a dataset sits at the intersection of **data-protection law** and **protective-security policy**, responsibility is divided:  
- the **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** governs lawfulness and rights,  
- the **Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO)** / **Caldicott Guardian** / **Monitoring Officer** governs protective marking.  

This letter makes them answer *together*, eliminating the “someone else’s problem” gap that allows zombie flags to persist.

## ✉️ Template Letter  

> **Subject:** Joint Clarification Request — Data-Restriction / Protective-Marking Authority  
>
> Dear [Names],  
>
> I am writing to both of you in your capacities as **Data Protection Officer** and **[SIRO / Caldicott Guardian / Monitoring Officer]** for [organisation].  
>
> I seek confirmation regarding any restriction, classification, or protective-marking applied to records identifying me within your systems.  
>
> Please confirm:  
> 1. Whether such a restriction exists and its **precise label**;  
> 2. The **decision-maker**, **date**, and **legal or policy authority** under which it was applied;  
> 3. The **purpose** of the restriction and how long it has remained active;  
> 4. Whether any ministerial certificate or external clearance under the *Official Secrets Act* or equivalent has ever been issued; and  
> 5. If no continuing lawful basis exists, when the restriction will be **removed or downgraded to OFFICIAL**.  
>
> Please provide a joint response within one month in accordance with **Article 12(3) UK GDPR**.  
>
> I appreciate that historic markings may have arisen from administrative or risk-management caution. My aim is to ensure accuracy and transparency across records, not to attribute fault.  
>
> Sincerely,  
> [Your Name]  
> [Contact details / Reference number]

A single signed reply from both officers closes the loop that otherwise sustains residual containment.

*📋 Dual-Officer Clarification Request* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It standardises how to compel joint accountability where governance and data-protection lines intersect, ensuring that mis-used classifications cannot persist through ambiguity.
