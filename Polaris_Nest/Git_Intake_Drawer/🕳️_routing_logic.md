**First created:** 2025-11-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-09  
*How institutional metadata systems treat identity as a security-risk multiplier.*

## 🧭 Purpose  
To model the metadata logic by which identity categories — ethnicity, religion, gender — become routing accelerators or suppressors.

## 🧠 Key Domains  
- Risk-weighting algorithms  
- Reputational hazard modelling  
- Priority queues for “optics”  
- State adjacency scoring  

---

## 🔍 Analytical Goal  
Reveal why identity-coded allegations escalate faster than disclosures of violence, harm, or breaches.

---

## 🌌 Constellations  
🕳️ 🙄 🔮 ⚖️ — routing, risk, identity, oversight.
