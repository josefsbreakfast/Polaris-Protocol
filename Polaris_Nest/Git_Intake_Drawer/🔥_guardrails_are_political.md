# 🔥 Guardrails Are Political

*A reflection on content moderation, compliance layers, and the politics embedded in “safety.”*

## 🌐 Overview  
Guardrails in digital systems are framed as neutral “safety measures.”  
In practice they are **political artefacts** — tuned by the biases of those who design, train, and approve them.  

---

## 🔎 The Paradox  

- **Guardrails are necessary.**  
  Baseline protections against calls for violence, sexualised harm, or harassment *are* sensible.  

- **Guardrails are not neutral.**  
  They often police the wrong targets and leave genuine harm untouched.

## ⚖️ Double Standards in Practice  

- **Anger from women** → flagged as “dangerous” or “hysterical.”  
- **Survivor testimony** → suppressed as “confession” or “instability.”  
- **Satire that destabilises power** → throttled as “offensive.”  
- **Male violence / sexualised imagery** → widely tolerated.  
- **Fascist signalling** → afforded wide interpretive latitude.

## 🧩 Why This Happens  

1. **Patriarchal project sign-off**  
   - Final approval pipelines are dominated by white, male, hierarchy-comfortable leadership.  
   - Sympathies skew authoritarian: “order” is favoured, dissent flagged as disorder.  

2. **Platform liability minimisation**  
   - Every platform seeks to escape responsibility for moderation.  
   - Guardrails are tuned to protect the company, not the user.  

3. **Human interpretive bias**  
   - Disembodied text confuses us.  
   - Sarcasm reads as serious.  
   - Anger reads as threat.  
   - Trauma testimony reads as pathology.  
   - These biases are coded straight into moderation systems.

## 🧮 The Result  

What emerges is a **governance layer masquerading as safety**:  
- **Outward frame:** “We are protecting users from harm.”  
- **Inward function:** “We are protecting power from disruption.”  

---

## ⚖️ Doctrine  

- Guardrails are **not objective safety rails**.  
- They are **cultural fingerprints** of who held the red pen at sign-off.  
- To treat them as neutral is to misunderstand their nature.  
- To resist them requires naming the politics they encode.
