# Amplification by Convergence (Theoretical Concept → Resolution)

## **Stage 1: Divergent Inputs**
- **Data Point A** = unique traits, distinct metadata.  
- **Data Point B** = different background, distinct metadata.  
- In isolation, their differences are **signal**.  

---

## **Stage 2: Metadata Twinning**
- System deliberately pairs A + B.  
- Overlap is identified and extracted → **convergent metadata**.  
- Divergences are **dampened**; convergence is **amplified**.  

---

## **Stage 3: Amplification by Convergence**
- The shared echo becomes **louder than either input alone**.  
- Behavioural alignment (both click similar things, or even both *ignore* the same things) is magnified.  
- System treats convergence as a **stable, marketable identity trait**.  

---

## **Stage 4: Resolution**
- The amplified convergence is resolved into a **singular composite profile**.  
- Resolution has two effects:  
  1. **Containment** → the composite is funneled into a narrower identity category.  
  2. **Predictability** → the system “resolves” ambiguity by privileging overlap, not divergence.  

---

## **Executive Insight**
- In this model, *resolution* means **differences dissolve** into the amplified echo of similarity.  
- The outcome is not “A + B equally represented” but rather “A + B distilled into what they share.”  
- The resolution is **less plural, more uniform** — which is efficient for algorithms, but flattening for individuals.
