# 🧮 Provocation Capture — When Goading Becomes a Data-Generation Method  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*On the instrumental use of provocation and humiliation as a way of eliciting “authentic” data.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Occasionally a subject is not simply observed but **goaded** — pushed, needled, or trapped into producing material that can later be mined as “natural” data.  
This node defines that dynamic as *provocation capture*: an ethically invalid method that converts distress into evidence.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Deliberate emotional triggering** to elicit expressive or vocal data.  
- **Medium targeting:** the provocation steers the subject toward a specific communication channel (voice, text, video).  
- **Recognition signalling:** the provocateur can recognise the output once it appears in that medium.  
- **Ethical breach:** consent is absent; the resulting dataset is contaminated by coercion.  
- **Audit requirement:** such material must be flagged, quarantined, and removed from analytic use.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1. Mechanism  
Provocation capture exploits human reactivity.  
An operator introduces stress, embarrassment, or desire so that the subject produces high-arousal data: tone shifts, lexical markers, or physiological cues.  
These are recorded and later described as “authentic response.”  

### 2. Medium control  
The provocation is tuned to the desired format:  
- vocal irritation → **speech dataset**,  
- textual outburst → **sentiment corpus**,  
- visual reaction → **facial-emotion library**.  
The resulting trace appears spontaneous but is architected.

### 3. Recognition loop  
Because the goading is personal, the person who initiated it can easily recognise the outcome.  
This creates a feedback channel inside the dataset: the provocateur knows which sample is theirs, even if identifiers are stripped.

### 4. Governance implications  
Data obtained through provocation are non-consensual and invalidate any downstream analysis.  
Institutions must maintain:  
1. **Red-flag protocols** for coercive or distress-derived content.  
2. **Quarantine procedures** — removal from training or audit sets.  
3. **Ethics escalation** — report to data-protection or safeguarding officers.  
4. **Duty of care** — subjects must be informed and supported once discovery occurs.

### 5. Structural insight  
Provocation capture shows the limit of purely technical governance:  
a model cannot detect when pain has been used as instrumentation.  
Only human oversight and dialogic verification can expose coercion in data provenance.

*🧮 Provocation Capture — When Goading Becomes a Data-Generation Method* is a governance and ethics note of the **Polaris Protocol.**  
It formalises the practice of analysing distress-derived data without consent as a structural failure of oversight and advocates immediate quarantine of affected material.
