# 🧩 Policy Capture: Quilliam & CTSA 2015  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*How the Quilliam Foundation — a privately funded, ideologically driven organisation with opaque donors — shaped key sections of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, embedding racialised suspicion into UK law.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Prevent is often presented as a neutral state project.

It was not.

The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (CTSA 2015), which legally locked Prevent into public institutions, was shaped heavily by:

- lobbying,  
- think-tank pressure,  
- external ideological influence,  
- and a specific organisation with outsized political proximity: **the Quilliam Foundation**.

This node explains how Quilliam captured the policy space around Prevent — and how its worldview became statutory law.

---

## 🧩 Structural Analysis  

### **1. Quilliam positioned itself as “the expert voice” on extremism**  
Between 2010–2015, Quilliam:

- briefed MPs,  
- shaped Home Office language,  
- provided its own “research,”  
- advised committees,  
- produced professional training templates,  
- defined “extremism indicators.”

Many of these indicators became embedded into CTSA 2015 guidance.

---

### **2. Quilliam’s definitions were ideological, not empirical**  
Quilliam’s framework cast:

- Muslim religious identity,  
- political dissent,  
- anti-imperialist thinking,  
- diaspora grief,

as risk markers.

These ideological assumptions influenced:

- Channel vulnerability categories,  
- Prevent training slides,  
- school-level guidance,  
- risk-indicator lists still in circulation today.

---

### **3. Funding opacity undermined democratic legitimacy**  
Quilliam received money from:

- foreign governments,  
- private donors,  
- political actors with geopolitical interests.

Some funding sources were never disclosed.

A democracy cannot base counterterror policy on an organisation that:

- will not reveal donors,  
- has political agendas,  
- has ideological motivations.

Yet it did.

---

### **4. Quilliam shaped Prevent’s racialised architecture**  
Key ideas that entered CTSA-era Prevent materials include:

- “ideology grooming,”  
- “identity instability,”  
- “susceptibility through emotion,”  
- “Muslim political anger as early radicalisation,”  
- “behavioural drift,”  
- “direction of travel.”

These concepts targeted racialised communities structurally.

---

### **5. Policy capture happened through advisory proximity**  
Quilliam staff were:

- in meetings with ministers,  
- consulted by Select Committees,  
- referenced in Home Office documents,  
- used to justify existing CT narratives,  
- treated as independent experts.

Their worldview infiltrated the state through soft power.

---

### **6. CTSA 2015 cemented Quilliam’s influence into law**  
Legislation:

- created the Prevent Duty,  
- embedded Prevent in schools/NHS/HE,  
- formalised multi-agency information sharing,  
- defined suspicious behaviour templates.

All infused with Quilliam-style ideological assumptions.

Once law is passed, ideology becomes structure.

---

### **7. Policy capture produced long-term structural racism**  
Because Quilliam’s definitions:

- pathologised Muslim identity,  
- framed diaspora political emotion as risk,  
- conflated religiosity with extremism,

Prevent now structurally reproduces:

- racial profiling,  
- emotional misclassification,  
- political suppression,  
- suspicion of minorities.

This is the legacy of policy capture.

## 🧪 Case Window (Patterns)

*Synthesised from parliamentary archives, policy papers, Home Office documents — no personal data.*

- MPs citing Quilliam publications as “research,” despite methodological flaws.  
- CTSA guidance echoing Quilliam phraseology verbatim.  
- Prevent training borrowing Quilliam’s “vulnerability factors.”  
- Think-tank briefings being treated as neutral evidence.  
- Advisory appointments recycling the same ideological framing.

This is classic policy capture.

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• External ideology became state doctrine**  
This is the opposite of evidence-based policy.

### **• Counterterror policy was shaped by unaccountable actors**  
No transparency, no democratic mandate.

### **• Racialised harm is baked into statutory architecture**  
Because the ideology that shaped the policy was racialised.

### **• Parliamentary oversight was undermined**  
MPs relied on “expertise” that was neither neutral nor transparent.

### **• CTSA 2015 cannot be understood without understanding Quilliam**  
The structure carries the imprint of the think-tank that shaped it.
