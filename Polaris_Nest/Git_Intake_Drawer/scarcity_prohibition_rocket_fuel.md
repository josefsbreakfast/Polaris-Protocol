## 🚀 Scarcity + Prohibition = Rocket Fuel

One of the most consistent features of book culture: **the moment something looks like it’s being withheld, demand spikes.**  

- **Scarcity** (hard to get, glitched, low-stock, delayed dispatch) makes a book feel *special*.  
- **Prohibition** (rumoured bans, “don’t read this,” whispers of suppression) makes a book feel *dangerous*.  
- Put together, they flip a switch in the book-nerd psyche: *must have now.*  

### Why it works  
- **Curiosity drive:** readers want to know *what was so bad* it got hidden.  
- **Moral framing:** buying becomes resistance. *“If it’s suppressed, owning it is a stand.”*  
- **Status economy:** possession = social capital. Owning the “banned” book confers insider prestige.  
- **Self-perpetuating loop:** gossip spreads scarcity; scarcity amplifies gossip.  

### Case studies  
- **D.H. Lawrence, *Lady Chatterley’s Lover*** (UK obscenity trial, 1960): prosecution ensured mass readership.  
- **James Joyce, *Ulysses*** (banned in US/UK until 1930s): censorship made it legendary.  
- **Salman Rushdie, *The Satanic Verses*** (1989): global controversy turned into huge sales.  
- **Samizdat in the USSR**: underground duplication of banned texts created prestige economies.  
- **Modern US school/library bans**: recent waves have consistently driven challenged books (e.g. *Maus*, *Gender Queer*) up bestseller charts.  

### Protocol relevance  
Suppression (real or perceived) isn’t a brake — it’s an accelerant.  
Every attempt to throttle access creates the conditions for wildfire spread.  

👉 **Takeaway:** In literary ecosystems, “you mustn’t” is the most reliable marketing line ever written.
