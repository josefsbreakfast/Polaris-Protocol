## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Mass Performance as Affective Power  
Synchrony, harmony, scale, theatre → deep emotional circuits.

### 2. The Choir as State Technology  
It softened Russia’s image globally through emotional excess.

### 3. Camp Militarism Works  
Uniforms + theatricality = charm.

### 4. Spectacle Creates Goodwill  
Goodwill outlives political approval.

### 5. Loss of the Choir = Loss of Soft Power  
Post-2016 crash → aesthetic vacuum.
