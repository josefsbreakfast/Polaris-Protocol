*How to recognise the exact moment when a respectable space reveals its extremist core.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Mask‑slip recognition is the skill of noticing when an apparently respectable event crosses into alt‑right or authoritarian territory.

It is a semiotic and bodily event: tone, language, and audience response change before anyone says “I am extremist.”

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Micro‑signals and somatic cues of ideological danger.  
- Emotional pattern preceding recognition.  
- Semiotic ruptures: aesthetic vs content mismatch.  
- GI‑Robot moment as a cognitive model.  
- Early‑warning heuristics.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Rhetorical Slippage  
Watch for:

- “culture” → “civilisation” → “survival”  
- “values” → “threat”  
- “identity” → “purity”  
- “migration” → “replacement”  

When vocabulary jumps from description to apocalypse, the mask is slipping.

### 2. Affective Slippage  
Tone shifts from:

- reflective → frantic  
- curious → punitive  
- analytical → paranoid  

Emotion reveals ideology.

### 3. Social Slippage  
The room betrays itself:

- laughter at cruel jokes  
- applause at punitive lines  
- visible relaxation when scapegoats are named  
- visible discomfort in a quiet minority  

Rooms tell the truth faster than speakers.

### 4. Bodily Indicators  
Typical sensations:

- stomach drop  
- tight chest  
- creeping nausea  
- “I shouldn’t be here” feeling  
- urge to leave without clear reason  

These are valid danger signals.
