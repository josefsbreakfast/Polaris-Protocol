*ICJ proceedings on misuse of the Genocide Convention & related atrocity probes*  

---

## 📜 Timeline  

- **2022-02-26** — Ukraine files application at the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** under the Genocide Convention.  
  - Core claim: Russia falsely alleged “genocide” in Donbas to justify invasion.  
  - Ukraine requests the Court declare no genocide and order Russia to stop military operations.  

- **2022-03-07** — Oral hearings in The Hague (Russia boycotted the first session, but sent a letter).  

- **2022-03-16** — ICJ orders **provisional measures**:  
  - Russia must “immediately suspend” military operations.  
  - Russia must ensure no aggravation of the dispute.  
  - Russia ignores the order.  

- **2022–2023** — Case proceeds on merits; written submissions exchanged.  

- **Parallel tracks**:  
  - **International Criminal Court (ICC)** opens investigation into war crimes, crimes against humanity, possible genocide.  
  - **OSCE, UN human rights bodies** document deportations of children, attacks on civilians, filtration camps.  

- **2023–2025** — Ongoing litigation. The ICJ case is about *abuse of the Genocide Convention* (not proving genocide in Ukraine).  
  - ICC and UN inquiries continue assessing whether Russian actions (especially mass child deportations) meet the legal threshold of genocide.

*Ukraine v Russia — Genocide Claim Timeline* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how “genocide” was contested at the ICJ, and how parallel accountability tracks (ICC, UN) diverged in scope.
