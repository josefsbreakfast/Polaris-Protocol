# 🧷 Structural Attraction to Power Roles  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-22  
*Why power-dense safeguarding environments attract a predictable minority of harmful or boundary-poor actors.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Across all governance domains, roles that grant **visibility over vulnerability** attract people with very different motivations. Most enter to help. A minority enter for power, access, or control. The danger is not the people — it is the **role-gravity**: the way informational power reshapes who applies, who stays, and who drifts toward the core.  
This node maps the access-risk logic and explains why multi-agency, information-rich environments increase this gravitational pull.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Access-risk theory: why power attracts misuse.  
- Role-gravity in safeguarding and multi-agency hubs.  
- Statistical reality framing (not moral judgment).  
- Governance implications for Polaris and civic systems.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### **1. Role-Gravity Is Not Moral — It’s Structural**  
Any role granting access to:  
- vulnerable people  
- trauma metadata  
- discretionary decision-making  
- cross-agency intelligence  
naturally attracts those who enjoy asymmetrical power.

Most people use that power ethically.  
A predictable minority don’t.

The job is not the problem.  
**The gravity is.**

### **2. Information-Rich Environments Increase That Gravity**  
When safeguarding/Prevent/multi-agency teams gain:  
- dashboards  
- pattern visibility  
- narrative authority  
- access to pooled trauma flags  
- institutional influence  

…the role becomes **more attractive** to:  
- boundary-poor actors  
- coercive personalities  
- people who derive validation from control  
- people who enjoy unearned authority  

Again: not a judgment about any person.  
This is **access-risk mechanics**.

### **3. Governance Must Assume Attempted Infiltration**  
DBS filtering is a *floor*, not a guarantee.  
Serious safeguarding systems use layered protections (Swiss Cheese logic):  
- supervision  
- access logs  
- rotation  
- minimisation  
- cross-checks  
- external oversight  

Systems fail when they assume:  
“Everyone here is good.”  
Systems succeed when they assume:  
“A statistical minority will always misuse access if permitted.”

*🧷 Structural Attraction to Power Roles* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It supports governance design across multi-agency and metadata-dense systems by mapping role-gravity and access-risk logic.
