*How machine flattening and bad-faith intake trap citizens in perpetual surveillance loops*

---

## Diagnostic Summary  

UK surveillance law insists on necessity, proportionality, and independent sign-off. In practice:  

- **Machine flattening**: AI misreads irony or sarcasm as literal risk; bias toward “better safe than sorry” pushes renewals through without a counter-check for citizen rights.  
- **Bad-faith intake**: A single malicious report (abusive partner, corrupt local official, vindictive colleague) can trigger a RIPA authorisation. Once entered, NCND protections and renewal inertia keep surveillance in place indefinitely.  

The result is a **dual-path vulnerability**: errors of code and errors of character alike lead to citizens being surveilled for years, not because of genuine threat but because the system is designed to err only in the direction of containment.

## Flowcharts  

### 1. Sarcasm → Surveillance (Machine Flattening Loop)  

[Citizen makes sarcastic remark]
                |
                v
 [AI/algorithmic filter flags it]
                |
                v
 [Context stripped → reads as literal threat]
                |
                v
 [Analyst/official bias: "better safe than sorry"]
                |
                v
 [Minister/judge signs warrant or renewal]
                |
                v
 [Surveillance extended — rights not weighed]

### 2. Malicious Report → Perpetual Containment (Bad Actor Intake Loop)  

 [Malicious actor (ex/colleague/local gov)]
                |
                v
   [False or bad-faith report submitted]
                |
                v
     [RIPA gateway triggered — NCND wall]
                |
                v
 [Initial warrant authorised ("just in case")]
                |
                v
 [3–6 month renewal cycles → rubber-stamped]
                |
                v
 [Citizen trapped in surveillance loop]
                |
                v
 [Justice blocked; corruption remains hidden]

## Implications  

- **Corruption vector**: Any node of corruption in local or central government can weaponise RIPA powers to silence whistleblowers.  
- **Oversight gap**: No statutory rotation or external conflict checks mean the same signatories can sustain surveillance across years.  
- **Justice denial**: Citizens are structurally prevented from accessing due process; the IPT route functions as a black box, not a remedy.

*Surveillance by Misread and Malice* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how misinterpretation and bad faith exploit the UK’s surveillance architecture to entrench containment.
