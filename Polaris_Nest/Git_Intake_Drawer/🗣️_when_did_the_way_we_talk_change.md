## 🧭 Overview  

The way we talk did not change in a single moment — it drifted, reshaped by the architectures of technology, governance, and fear.  
Every decade since the mid‑2000s has rewired not just what we say, but what speech is *for*.  
Once it was communication. Now it is visibility management.

## 1. The Mid‑2000s — From Forum to Feed  

Language moved from *conversation as thread* to *conversation as feed*.  
On message boards, words had context, history, and continuity.  
By 2008‑2012, social media replaced structure with velocity: every sentence became a micro‑broadcast.  
The result was **algorithmic tone drift** — shorter, louder, more performative.  
Speech evolved to serve the feed, not the interlocutor.

## 2. The 2010s — Moderation and “Engagement Tone”  

As platforms monetised attention, speech adapted to **moderation logic**.  
People learned to hedge, disclaim, and sanitise — while outrage was rewarded.  
The hybrid voice of the era emerged: part legal memo, part performance.  
Sarcasm replaced sincerity because sincerity could not go viral.

## 3. 2016–2020 — The Weaponisation of Irony  

The alt‑right and accelerationist networks turned irony into armour.  
“I’m just asking questions.” “It’s just a joke.”  
Every line carried a shadow meaning: plausible deniability as strategy.  
Memetic warfare blurred parody and propaganda until civic tone fractured completely.

## 4. Post‑2020 — The Surveillance Era of Speech  

Pandemic life made communication perpetual and recorded.  
Every message became a potential artefact.  
People began to write as if always observed — a **defensive performance**.  
AI systems learned from us, re‑training tone through feedback loops of our own language.  
Speech itself became a site of governance.

## 5. The Now — Speech as Infrastructure  

Today, we speak inside an architecture optimised for:  
- **Visibility management** — “Will this get flagged?”  
- **Algorithmic comprehension** — “Will this rank?”  
- **Psychological containment** — “Will this expose me?”  

The way we talk changed when our words stopped being between us,  
and started being between us **and the machine that sells our attention back to us.**
