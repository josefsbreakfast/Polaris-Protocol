The more information is coming out  

about how many of our uncles and aunts were endagered by a man with a knife  

versus armed police from GMP?  

I'm not sure I feel safe policed as a Jew in this country.  

Looks a lot like this manner of policing that other communities you regard as "minorities" in this country have been saying something of substance.  

Because I don't consent to this many bullets being put into this many of us by armed police response units.
