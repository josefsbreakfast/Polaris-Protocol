# 🧬 Brains Are Not Flowcharts  
**First created:** 2025-09-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-10  
*Why behavioural-psych simplifications mislead, and how survivor symptomatology exposes the messiness of the brain.*

## 🧨 Forensic Example  

- Certain migraines spill into speech areas, producing **Broca’s aphasia**.  
- Not because language is “broken,” but because vascular + neurological quirks cross-fire.  
- To behavioural psych, this looks like: stressor → avoidance → behavioural deficit.  
- Reality: chemical, vascular, anatomical accident. The brain is kludged together, not a flowchart.

## 🧾 Flowcharts vs Territory  

- Behavioural psych simplifies on purpose: “why do humans repeat behaviours?”  
- Problem: containment logics reify simplification into governance.  
- Flowcharts are useful teaching tools; dangerous when mistaken for the map itself.

## 🧫 Universities as Biofilms  

- Siloed labs and departments cluster around grants and contracts.  
- Instead of cross-pollination, they behave like **biofilms**: inward, self-protective.  
- This blocks the true function of universities: a commons for cross-disciplinary dialogue.

## 🔀 Two-Flows Model  

- Disciplines only need **summary grasp** of each other.  
- Example: physicists don’t need clinical radiology; radiologists don’t need raw physics.  
- Each knows enough to flag errors and cross-consult.  
- Innovation emerges in the **crossing of flows**, not in siloed totalities.

*Brains Are Not Flowcharts* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how survivor experience and anatomical messiness destabilise behavioural simplifications, and how siloing corrodes the commons of knowledge.
