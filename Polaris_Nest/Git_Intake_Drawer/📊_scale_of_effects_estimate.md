# 📊 Scale of Effects Estimate — Who Is Likely Affected  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*Outlines which groups are most likely to be directly or indirectly affected by manufactured provenance, nudging, and data-twin exploitation. Provides a first-pass estimate of scale to help define an auditable population.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Not everyone is directly affected. The impact concentrates in identifiable professional and institutional pools. This node estimates orders of magnitude and distinguishes between **directly targeted individuals**, **indirect service impacts**, and **systemic effects**. The aim is to define a data pool suitable for auditing.

---

## 📍 Numerical Headline (at a glance)  
- **Directly affected:** ~1,000–3,000 people UK-wide over the last decade.  
- **Indirectly affected:** ~10,000–50,000 clients, patients, students, and service users.  
- **Systemically affected:** broad trust impacts across the general population.

---

## 📍 Directly Affected Groups  
- **Security-cleared staff**  
  - Vulnerable to clearance review triggered by weak digital signals.  
  - Likely scale: low hundreds.  

- **Registered professions** (healthcare workers, lawyers, teachers, social workers)  
  - Subject to disciplinary/complaints regimes where manufactured evidence is enough to trigger action.  
  - Likely scale: high hundreds to low thousands.  

- **Academics / policy-adjacent professionals**  
  - Attendees at conferences, workshops, seminars with exploitable Wi-Fi/registration stacks.  
  - Likely scale: hundreds to low thousands.  

- **Activists / whistleblowers**  
  - Frequent FOI/SAR users; disempowered by refusals and diversion.  
  - Likely scale: low hundreds.  

---

## 📍 Indirectly Affected Groups  
- **Clients, patients, students, service users**  
  - Knock-on effects when their professionals are discredited, displaced, or sanctioned.  
  - Likely scale: tens of thousands.  

- **Institutional ecosystems**  
  - Universities, NHS trusts, professional regulators experiencing erosion of trust and service disruption.  
  - Scale: systemic, but measurable in case-clusters.

---

## 📈 Orders of Magnitude (hypothesis)  
- **Directly affected, targeted individuals**: ~1,000–3,000 UK-wide (last decade).  
- **Indirect service ripple effects**: ~10,000–50,000 clients/patients/students.  
- **Systemic trust erosion**: broad, population-level but harder to quantify.

---

## 🔎 Why This Matters  
- Identifying scale converts a diffuse sense of “everyone’s at risk” into a **defined audit population**.  
- Enables targeted evidence collection: log exports, complaint records, FOI refusals.  
- Provides NGOs/journalists a manageable dataset to investigate.
