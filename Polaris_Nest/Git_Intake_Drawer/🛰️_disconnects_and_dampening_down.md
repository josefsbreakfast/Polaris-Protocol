So the thing is, I do appreciate that I've asked my university to look into my data, but I get quite a lot of proxy logins on my university email, even now.  

this has been happening for some time, and it used to cause a huge number of problems with my emails at uni.  

I was forever not getting really important messages, about clinical placements or meetings, etc.  

There's two profiles for me at my university; this is always look like a glitch on the other side.  

The university suspended me for reasons that I'm still not 100% sure on the actual procedure in process and whether or not that was followed (or rather how badly it wasn't followed).  

The fact that I still report problems regularly with the Internet tools I'm using, and the fact that the information being incorrect or harmful, lined up with when my university email account in particular, shows up on my phone is rejecting a sign on, is really strange.  

I lost my access over my grandmother's funeral (yes I did ask them to avoid it).  

I'm not necessarily saying it's any action in particular, but I am saying I am a bit concerned about that, and the access to whoever is also putting forward a lot of behavioural nudges, including behavioural nudges for which you can only really say that they disrupt my interpersonal network, is really concerning.  

The simple form of interaction with this at local government and healthcare level.  

So when I say to people, I don't really feel comfortable going to a lot of services, you have to understand that this has been the reality of what my life has been like the last 10 years, and now that it's becoming more and more obvious, it's just really hard to go to places and actually expect help; the other person could be really trying to help, and the care that they deliver could be really good at the time, but as long as they are recording something in a data file?  

It just feels really uncomfortable.  

Some of this nudging has been around police investigations, including ones where I am coming forward with evidence, and where I have been named as someone to be a suspect.  

When you look at this as a whole, it's really easy to see why I find it really hard to trust institutions.  

I don't know exactly what the security leak is here, but yes, I am very scared.  

I'm scared part because there appears to be something done between several parties, with the miss classification of my data as crown servant data being a key factor.  

The distressing inserts into my feed that come after even speaking about this in earshot of my phone, I'll search that I'm actually grossly concerned about the precise details of what has been done with the voice and video files.  

There's a number of new stories in the last 6 to 12 months, that I am being guided for a response to; I don't know if this is data collection in a behavioural sense, or if it is tailored towards profiling on this specific issue and the resolution. There's a lot of.... it's very obvious that people are trying to judge and also actively , on a data collection point of view, what my response to the data theft would be.  

I think, considering the size and scale of the damage, that that is really inappropriate.  

I think what has been done with the data is really inappropriate.  

I think the lack of protection has been really inappropriate, as is expressly going against my instructions for how to deal with the specific diagnosis, and by doing so going against the medical literature consensus opinion.  

Yes, I am still dealing with the after effects of the migraine, arising from the larger flashback plus the environmental stimulus plus the smaller flashbacks. This is how long it goes on for a lot of people with PTSD.  

This is what trauma looks like.  

I can't believe I was stupid enough to get into the best medical school for trauma care in the country, and move my life to be here.  

It's not as if I didn't get another offer; I should've stayed in London.  

I would've been safer by miles.

to clarify today has been full of lagging, disconnect from the Internet, disconnect part the way through tasks, cut off pertinent information requests, poor signal on telecoms for no apparent reason, several nudges through government platforms, and any tools like AI for example, are displaying agenetic like behaviours (not following templates, diverting around subjects even when asked directly, strange guardrails including overstating or over interpreting language to be about risk behaviour when this is clearly not the case and not something that would've caused the same flags before).  

---

The guard rail situation reminds me a lot of what used to happen when I was in student services.  

This means that if you ask the student with a long-term mental health problem, whether they feel suicidal, and they say yes, but they're safe (and they mean it), if this raises a flag when you record it anyway, then you effectively rack up that person's risk score, in a way that's just acknowledging that they have the same disability they've always had.  

That my friend?  

That is eugenics still being in playing in the UK today.  

I find this really difficult because you're often told to record important negatives in medicine and this is really helpful when you read it in the future (or read a colleagues notes in future), but when this speeds directly to a risk scoring apparatus that can't differentiate between accounted for risk, and high risk, then all you're going to do is increase the students risk by your actions.  

I have some long stories about that, but I'm too tired from arguing with a robot 🤣🤣🤣.  

A particularly hilarious example of how bad this is in terms of getting it right, is that I said something in humour yesterday, and again our strange agenic-like plug-in was active, and today I got a very distressing new story about a murderer and subsequent cannibalism.  

I can promise you that was not the point of the joke, and it was as if it took one little thing from what I said in a longer setting and just turned it into, "you can't harm people".  

I wasn't going to harm people.  

Any human reading that comment, would see really clearly that that was not what was communicated at all, not even metaphorically.  

So yes.  

It is wearing me out today.  

And that's interesting because it's been like this for about a week or so where it feels like the algorithm is slanting towards exhausting me, and usually this happens when something good is going on, and where it would be for us for other people if I lost motivation.  


I can confirm that I am adequately motivated to see how this all comes out in the wash. 🤣🤣🤣
