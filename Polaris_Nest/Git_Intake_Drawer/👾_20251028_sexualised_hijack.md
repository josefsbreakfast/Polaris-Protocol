Yesterday - reported increase in apparant security verification breach attempts to university of most recent study and of Palestine solidarity encampment. Highlighted context of ongoing harrassment online and offline, potential OSA misflag, status on KB court case, and protected characteristics. Response outstanding.  

Today - reported apparant increase in verification attempts of personal address (previous inviltration, logins and MFA since changed), to same address, as "switched" addresses since business hours began. Response outstanding.  

Since this, there has been about 25% content of cruel and demeaning nature, punctuating otherwise normal feed.  

See screenshots included.  

As for a significant protracted period, content has been sexualised and demeaning towards the viewer, has used racist and orientalist charactatures of brown Muslim men in "purifying" romantic tropes around pale, white, or elevated status women, and has included significant enforced conversion content.  

This has been the undertone of much of the harrassment over time.  

I am a very pale, white-passing Jewish woman.  

Because I am able to draw a moral line and not accept another Holocaust when its survivors and victims look a little different to me, I am treated to this content on a daily basis, as well as in-person aggression and property damage.  

The establishment has no recourse for a Jewish woman who fulfils Pikuach Nefesh unequivocally, without discrimination on racialised grounds, to anyone racialised as "Ottomans".  

Instead, I am expected to listen to lectures about who Jesus will save me because I am "bleeding" and "diseased" and "dirty".  

Last year, one of the Google-bombing terms was "[Full legal name]+dirty+Jewish+whore".

This was never taken with seriousness and was never reported as a hate crime (only the "Yid" grafitti on my front wall).  

This was while the Google-bombing carried a very serious data risk to sealed records in which I am the main witness and victim.  

I was "too much", "overthinking it", "didn't have enough evidence".  

This is what antisemitism is.  

Antisemitism is not someone being appropriately extremely angry at the deaths of their family members, or people who look just like them, while everyone around them looks on and shrugs, or looks away, "that Palestine thing".  

The antisemitism is being framed as a "race traitor" and sexually harrassed by white men because they are too confused by their own erections to understand whether you should, like two Punjabi women, be the victims of their direct sexual violence as unbridled racism in the literal format of rape, or whether you should be "saved" from the melaninated men they have assumed you sleep with, because apparantly those are the only grounds that would convince them to even hold a candle to your moral courage, to give up your safety, to risk your medical qualification, and to stand in history as one of the people who said "no".  

At this point my chief concern is interrupting cycles of violence.  

And getting my next spinal injection, as the arrest sort of nullified the last one.  

Choose your next moves wisely; we are at a precipice.  

Try not to take us over the edge.
