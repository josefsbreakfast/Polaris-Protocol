now it has lagged proton vpn so badly on 5G that it may not accept a log-in.  

i wonder what the issue could possibly be. this is obviously such a normal, non-targeted, infrastructure issue.  

it definitly is not being butthurt and definitly not the surveillance squad; nope nope nope.

and to think i toned down the bad broadway singing for you guys...  

not making that mistake again.

i found the sound for what i was laughing at bwahahahahaha i'm a genius.

ahhhhhhh i've just looked at what we were working on before this spate of interference (yes, there is potential interference of contacts also), and we're looking at charity regieme reform.  

again...  

i cannot possibly imagine why this would be a touchy subject to whoever is messing with my telecoms experience...  

who has telecoms experience who might be annoyed with me idk who could it be.  

*significant defiation from a preset group of rules entered into a genAI tool to secifically narrow what tasks are performed, and getting a wildly different format, does not match the behaviour of genAI; this is not how chatgpt is designed, and therefore it is likely to be the result of interference of an agent-like extrenal source*
