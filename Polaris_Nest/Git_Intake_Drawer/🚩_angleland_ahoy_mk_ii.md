# 🚩 Angleland Ahoy Mk II
**First created:** 2025-10-04  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A satirical governance-RPG set in the archipelago of Angleland, where every regulation is a side quest and every audit is a boss fight.*

---

## Premise
Welcome, Compliance Officer Adventurer.  
The Ministry of System Governance has declared that public trust must be gamified.  
You have been drafted into **Angleland Ahoy**, a semi-serious simulation of bureaucratic survival in late-stage regulation.  
Your mission: keep the paperwork afloat while steering through waves of moral panic, data leaks, and committee drama.

---

## How to Play
1. **Assemble Your Committee** – 3–6 players, one must be a *Designated Responsible Person*.  
2. **Draw Event Cards** from the deck whenever a policy crisis occurs.  
3. **Track Reputation Points** on your organisation’s risk register.  
4. **Complete Audits** to level up; failure triggers a *Ministerial Review*.  
5. **Collect Compliance Badges** (ISO, ESG, EDI, AI) to unlock the *Freedom of Information Endgame*.

---

## Key Factions
- **The NPM Consortium** – re-branding neoliberalism as agile deliverables.  
- **The Committee for Infinite Consultation** – meetings that spawn sequels.  
- **Wardrobe of Optics** – disguises for when accountability calls.  
- **Citizens of Nowhere Ltd.** – rogue auditors turned pirates.  

---

## Win Conditions
- Survive three budget cycles without a safeguarding inquiry.  
- Publish one glossy strategy that changes nothing yet pleases everyone.  
- Keep the *Freedom of Information Endgame* unopened; that’s the real victory.

## Tone & Use
Write straight, play crooked.  
The satire works best when the language stays managerial and the chaos emerges naturally.  
Think: *Yes Minister meets Dungeons & Dragons via a compliance dashboard.*
