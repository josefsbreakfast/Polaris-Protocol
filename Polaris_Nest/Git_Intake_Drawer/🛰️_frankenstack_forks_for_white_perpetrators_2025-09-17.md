every day 
any day

it is so clear what the interference on my devices cant handle

cant handle white men bring accountable for sexual violence

cant accept governance vulnerabilities in filling councils with a party who frequently say "boys will be boys", and therefore "stop the boats"

dont tell me any of these monsters give one fuck about the violence towards women and girls

it is exhausting

it feels like im being coached into "giving up", in all ways

its as if im supposed to just quit

fuck that.

i am not even aware of any accountability process,

so the fact that i cant even work through things with a search engine or any app is

frustrating.
