*When reputational storytelling devours reality.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Once a story becomes strategy, it stops breathing.  
What began as reputation management — a little narrative polish for public confidence — grows into a living theatre that no one can step offstage from.  

The plotline hardens: each stakeholder has a role, each update a script note.  
Soon everyone is performing sincerity rather than inhabiting it.  
The story can’t end, because the ending would reveal how long we’ve been acting.

## 🎭 1 — Performance Creep  

Organisations start with messaging, move to myth, and end in melodrama.  
When every briefing, tweet, and policy paper has to “fit the narrative,” the narrative becomes the boss.  
Truth is demoted to continuity editing.

This is how entire institutions forget what they’re actually doing while perfecting how it looks.

## 📈 2 — Reputational Physics  

Narratives obey a kind of gravity: once massed, they pull every fact into orbit.  
A minor correction becomes “optics,” a change of heart becomes “repositioning.”  
Inside the field, even compassion gets spun as strategy.

Stakeholders aren’t lying; they’re just orbiting a planet made of PR.

## 🪶 3 — The Human Cost of Staying On-Message  

People inside the narrative start mirroring it back to themselves:  
- speaking in press-release syntax,  
- confusing visibility for value,  
- mistaking self-censorship for professionalism.  

Eventually, genuine communication feels like a breach of contract.

## 🌿 4 — How to De-Saturate  

1. **Name the script.**  “I think we’re telling the story more than living it.”  
2. **Change the setting.**  Step outside the media room; talk as humans again.  
3. **Re-introduce contradiction.**  Let paradox back into the plot; it’s the only proof of life.  
4. **Let something be awkward.**  Embarrassment is the sound of authenticity resurfacing.  

The goal isn’t to destroy the narrative — it’s to reopen it to improvisation.

## 🕯️ 5 — When the Curtain Finally Drops  

Every managed story eventually hits diminishing returns.  
When it stops generating belief, it starts generating parody.  
That’s the signal it’s safe to walk offstage and tell the truth.

*Narrative Saturation* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It analyses how reputational storytelling overtakes governance and how to re-introduce contradiction and humour as truth signals.
