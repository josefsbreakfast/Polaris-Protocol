## 🧭 Orientation

This node extends the original `🪶 tea_toast_and_transparency.md`,  
shifting the lens from *inquiry as theatre* to *humour as civic metabolism*.  

Humour here is not distraction — it’s maintenance.  
A way for the public to metabolise absurdity without surrendering to it.

## 💡 Why Levity Matters

| Function | Description | Civic Analogue |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Pressure Valve** | Releases tension without collapse. | Parliamentary debate; FOI appeals. |
| **Cognitive Reset** | Converts anger into pattern-recognition. | Investigative satire, editorial cartoons. |
| **Social Glue** | Laughter builds horizontal solidarity. | Libraries, group chats, protest humour. |
| **Defensive Shield** | Protects the psyche from institutional absurdity. | Gallows humour, gentle ridicule, memes. |

Laughter restores system elasticity — it’s what keeps scrutiny humane.

## 🧩 The Tea Standard

The phrase *“bring out tea”* is not about retreat; it’s a tactical pause.  
It acknowledges tension, marks reflection, and reaffirms that conversation continues.  

Humour is the social equivalent of tea:  
it steadies hands that still have work to do.

## 🧠 Humour as Audit Tool

1. **Note the Absurd.** Bureaucracy always leaves fingerprints of irony.  
2. **Name the Pattern.** Joke structures reveal logical fallacies faster than policy briefings.  
3. **Archive the Wit.** Tweets, memes, and scripts form cultural metadata.  
4. **Feed the Loop.** What was comedy one year becomes case study the next.  

Polaris treats humour logs as legitimate civic data — traces of collective self-awareness.

## 🪞 Emotional Logic

When trust erodes, ridicule becomes a proxy immune system.  
It clears toxins, signals pain, and keeps moral circulation alive.  

> “We laugh because we refuse to rot.”
