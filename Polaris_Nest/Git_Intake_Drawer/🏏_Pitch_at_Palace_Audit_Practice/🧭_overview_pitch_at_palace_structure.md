## 🧭 Orientation

Pitch @ Palace was introduced as a gleaming bridge between monarchy, entrepreneurship, and diplomacy.  
It offered the image of modernisation without changing the underlying architecture of privilege.  
Between 2014 and 2019 it operated as a small company with a very large aura: a private structure presented as a public service.  

This node sketches what actually existed—how it was built, how it moved, and where the governance air-gaps appeared.  
It is not a dossier of wrongdoing; it is a diagram of how prestige creates a temporary exemption from ordinary oversight.

## 🏛️ Formation

Pitch @ Palace Ltd was incorporated in 2014 as a private company limited by shares.  
A second entity, Pitch @ Palace CIC, followed in 2018 to give a veneer of social purpose.  
Both were dissolved quietly between 2022 and 2023.  

Events were staged inside royal venues, but the Royal Household was never the legal controller.  
The stage and the structure were separate; that separation is the first fault-line.

## 🤝 Network

Inside the UK it linked government departments (UKTI → DIT → DBT), universities, and major sponsors—KPMG, Barclays, British Airways, Cisco.  
Abroad it cloned itself into Pitch @ Palace Global: chapters in the Gulf, Asia, Australia, Latin America.  
Most were held together by short memoranda rather than statute or treaty.  

Each event brought diplomats, investors, and start-ups into the same photo frame.  
The brand carried the legitimacy of the Palace, but none of its accountability.

## 💼 Operations

The visible function was a pitch event.  
The hidden function was a convening network—introductions, patronage, soft diplomacy.  
Revenue came through sponsorship and in-kind support.  
Data came from registration lists, photographs, and post-event correspondence.  
Governance came through no independent audit at all.  

Prestige behaved like a solvent: it dissolved questions faster than they could be asked.

## ⚖️ Governance Gaps

- **Accountability void :** Neither public body nor charity → no FOI, no transparent accounts.  
- **AML and PEP exposure :** Royal branding + sovereign-fund money = reputation laundering risk.  
- **Data-protection grey zone :** Overlapping controllers confuse ICO jurisdiction.  
- **Foreign-policy blur :** Performed diplomacy without FCDO supervision.  
- **Dissolution opacity :** Entities ended quietly; data fate undisclosed.  

Each gap is a door that never quite shuts, inviting the same category of opportunist.

## 🧩 Interpretation

Pitch @ Palace shows how a nation can build an *interface* instead of an institution.  
Prestige replaced governance; access replaced accountability.  
This is the domestic expression of the same pattern traced in `🌍 deregulation_as_diplomatic_infrastructure.md`—  
where deregulation becomes a diplomatic language and aura becomes policy.
