## 🧭 Orientation

Accountability was meant to restore trust.  
Instead, it has become theatre for its own absence.  

Each new scandal summons an inquiry, a committee, a report.  
Each promises closure; each delivers exhaustion.  
Over time, this repetition produces a new kind of failure — **systemic inquiry fatigue** —  
where even the act of accountability triggers disbelief.

## 🧩 The Inquiry Loop

The British state has perfected an emotional algorithm:  

1. **Scandal** → shock, outrage, promise of transparency.  
2. **Commissioning** → inquiry announced; judge appointed; deadlines deferred.  
3. **Performance** → testimony televised, empathy rehearsed.  
4. **Dilution** → findings softened; blame diffused.  
5. **Closure** → “Lessons learned.” No follow-through.  

This pattern is now so familiar it feels constitutional.  
Accountability has become a ritual, not a result.

## ⚖️ Trust Depletion Curve

Public confidence decays logarithmically:  
each inquiry yields smaller returns of faith.  

| Cycle | Official Intent | Public Reaction | Net Trust Delta |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1st | “We will uncover the truth.” | Hope | + |
| 3rd | “We take these findings seriously.” | Scepticism | ±0 |
| 5th | “We must move forward.” | Irony | − |
| 7th | “Lessons learned.” | Laughter | −− |

The state continues to speak the grammar of accountability,  
but the meaning has drained out of the words.

## 🧠 Emotional Economics

Trust functions like currency.  
It circulates through promises, expectations, and gestures of repair.  
When too many promises default, the emotional economy collapses.  

Citizens adapt by devaluing institutional language —  
“independent review,” “cross-party working group,” “public interest.”  
These phrases no longer signify remedy; they signify stalling.

## 🪞 Cultural Reflex

> “Another inquiry” has become Britain’s default form of grief management.  

We hold ceremonies for failure:  
press conferences, ribbons, reports heavy enough to feel like consequence.  
But nothing changes beneath the choreography.  

Inquiry fatigue is not apathy — it is a protective adaptation.  
People conserve belief the way they once conserved ration books.

## 🧩 Institutional Dynamics

- **Political Incentive:** inquiry as delay mechanism.  
- **Media Incentive:** scandal as narrative arc.  
- **Legal Incentive:** limited remit preserves future work.  
- **Public Incentive:** outrage exhaustion reduces mobilisation.  

The loop sustains itself because every participant benefits from its continuity,  
even as collective trust disintegrates.

## 🪶 Recovery Architecture

1. **Finite Inquiry Mandates** — automatic review of implementation, not just reporting.  
2. **Civic Tracking Systems** — open ledgers monitoring “lessons learned” outcomes.  
3. **Emotional Governance Literacy** — train officials in trust economics, not PR.  
4. **Public Right of Review** — citizens can audit inquiry recommendations after two years.  

Accountability must evolve from spectacle to maintenance —  
a slow craft of keeping promises alive.

## 🧭 Closing Reflection

Inquiry fatigue is democracy’s burnout.  
It doesn’t signal indifference, but grief.  

To heal trust, institutions must stop performing sincerity  
and start producing evidence.
