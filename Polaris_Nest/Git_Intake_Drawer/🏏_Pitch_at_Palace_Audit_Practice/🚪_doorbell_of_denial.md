## 🧭 Orientation

Every great British scandal eventually ends at a doorstep.  
A reporter appears, a door opens halfway, and the performance begins.  

This node diagrams the ritual logic of the *doorbell moment* — the instant when journalism, shame, and good lighting briefly coexist.

## 🧩 Flow of Denial

| Stage | Behaviour | Translation |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **1 — The Knock** | Journalist rings bell politely. | *Politeness precedes ambush.* |
| **2 — The Curtain Shift** | Subject peeks without answering. | *Calculating optics.* |
| **3 — The Half-Door Interview** | Door opens 7 inches. Statement emerges. | *“Now is not the appropriate time.”* |
| **4 — The Neighbour Cameo** | “He seemed nice — always put the bins out.” | *Civilian credibility buffer.* |
| **5 — The Retreat** | Subject closes door slowly, facing camera. | *Exit stage domestic.* |

> “Accountability with a doormat in shot.”

## ⚖️ Rules of Engagement

1. Maintain eye contact only through frosted glass.  
2. Use a mug as prop to signify relatability.  
3. Invoke privacy as public duty.  
4. Repeat “ongoing process” until van engine starts.  

This is not confrontation — it’s *co-authored awkwardness.*

## 🧠 Semiotic Notes

The doorstep encounter converts domesticity into transparency theatre.  
Kettles hiss in background; a lab retriever pads past like comic relief.  

Britain’s genius is to turn crisis into manners:  
> “We cannot comment in our own driveway.”

## 🪞 Cultural Function

The doorstep serves as our moral stage set —  
a liminal space where public and private swap lines mid-scene.  
It signals both access and resistance, democracy and detachment.  

It’s the only national ritual where denial wears slippers.

## 🧭 Closing Reflection

Every system has its ritual of avoidance; ours comes with a doorbell.  
Here, truth arrives uninvited and leaves politely —  
proof that even scandal respects British property law.
