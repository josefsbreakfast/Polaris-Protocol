## 🧭 Orientation

In times of scandal, the British state has one reliable reflex:  
put the kettle on and launch an inquiry.  

This manual offers a quick-brew recipe for institutional absolution — no fuss, no flavour, ready in minutes.

## 🧩 Instant Inquiry Mix

| Ingredient | Quantity | Function |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Mild Shock** | One front-page headline | Generates urgency without panic. |
| **Senior Retiree** | One knighted chairperson | Adds gravitas and amnesia. |
| **Terms of Reference** | Two pages, vague | Limits collateral transparency. |
| **Public Statement** | Half a paragraph | Signals accountability theatre. |
| **Tea & Biscuits** | Unlimited | Moral hydration for the process. |

Stir until consensus forms, then set aside indefinitely.  

---

## ⚖️ Brewing Instructions

1. **Boil the outrage.**  
   Use fresh scandal; stale crises won’t infuse properly.  
2. **Add procedural jargon.**  
   Let steep for six months or one election cycle, whichever comes first.  
3. **Skim off responsibility.**  
   Avoid over-steeping; it turns bitter.  
4. **Serve lukewarm with empathy.**  
   Garnish with “lessons learned.”  

> “Accountability should always be comforting, never hot.”

## 🧠 Serving Suggestions

- Pair with **delayed disclosure** for a balanced aroma of sincerity.  
- Best enjoyed during **select committee recess**.  
- For stronger flavour, add **public outrage** — though it may curdle morale.

## 🪞 Cultural Notes

The instant inquiry embodies Britain’s favourite governance philosophy:  
*something must be seen to be done, preferably with refreshments.*  

It allows institutions to process moral crises through the medium of mild hospitality.  
Politeness becomes due process; tea, a solvent for guilt.

## 🪶 Alternative Blends

| Variant | Description | Recommended Use |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Chamomile Closure** | Announces empathy without findings. | NHS failures, charity scandals. |
| **Earl Grey Delay** | Adds a note of dignity to deferral. | Ministerial misconduct. |
| **Peppermint Panic** | Rapid launch, immediate cooling. | Cyber incidents, data leaks. |
| **Decaf Responsibility** | Entirely symbolic; no caffeine, no change. | All of the above. |

## 🧭 Closing Reflection

If justice is slow-roasted, accountability here is instant granules.  
It dissolves entirely on contact with public trust.  

Still, we keep brewing —  
because in Britain, nothing settles the national stomach like a nice, soothing cover-up in a cup.
