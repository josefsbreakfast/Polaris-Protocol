## 🧭 Orientation

This node outlines the **regulatory context** and **risk architecture** surrounding Pitch @ Palace.  
It does not allege criminal activity.  
It documents why events combining royal prestige, private investment, and international sponsorship sit inside multiple high-risk classifications under UK and international compliance law.  

These frameworks — anti-money-laundering (AML), politically-exposed-person (PEP) management, and bribery-prevention — are not moral judgements; they are the mechanical systems meant to catch precisely this type of structural vulnerability.

## 🏦 Legal and Regulatory References

- **Money Laundering Regulations 2017 (as amended)**  
  Defines *relevant persons* (banks, accountants, company-service providers) and mandates due diligence when PEPs are involved.  

- **Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA)**  
  Criminalises the handling or facilitation of criminal property.  
  Triggers *Suspicious Activity Reports* (SARs) via the National Crime Agency (NCA).  

- **Bribery Act 2010**  
  Creates corporate liability for failure to prevent bribery.  
  Particularly relevant where sponsorship or introductions could be construed as “advantage.”  

- **UK Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018**  
  Governs cross-border transactions with sanctioned individuals or entities.  

- **Companies Act 2006 & CIC Regulations 2005**  
  Define reporting duties for directors of private and community-interest companies.

## 🧮 Risk Topology

| Risk Category | Description | Supervisory / Enforcement Body |
|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **PEP Exposure** | Direct royal involvement classifies all interactions as high-risk under AML standards. | Financial institutions (banks, accountants) / HMRC (supervisory) |
| **Reputation Laundering** | Using royal or charitable imagery to legitimise opaque investment sources. | FCA / Advertising Standards / HM Treasury |
| **Cross-border Funding** | Sovereign-fund or state-linked sponsorship without full disclosure. | NCA / OFSI / DBT |
| **Event-based Transactions** | Payments in kind or sponsorship exchanged for access or visibility. | Serious Fraud Office / HMRC |
| **Beneficial-Ownership Opacity** | Rapid creation / dissolution of short-life entities; unknown end-beneficiaries. | Companies House / NCA |
| **Data-handling Risk** | Global attendee data shared among multiple controllers. | ICO |

## 🧩 Structural Red Flags

1. **Event-as-Interface:** The financial and diplomatic space merge. It is difficult to distinguish investment promotion from influence-trading.  
2. **Aura Substitution:** Prestige becomes due diligence. When reputation stands in for verification, AML checks degrade.  
3. **Distributed Accountability:** Multiple co-hosts dilute clear reporting lines — an anti-audit design by default.  
4. **Political Buffering:** Royal association provides cultural immunity from scrutiny, weakening regulator appetite.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Compliance Questions Worth Asking

1. Who conducted *Customer Due Diligence* for sponsors or foreign investors attending events?  
2. Were PEP screening or source-of-funds declarations completed?  
3. Did any UK banks file SARs referencing Pitch @ Palace entities (Ltd or CIC)?  
4. How were sponsorship funds accounted for in the company’s abbreviated filings?  
5. Were gifts or hospitality logged by civil servants who attended under departmental auspices?  

Each of these questions can be translated into a **targeted FOI** or **regulatory request**, making this node a bridge between theory and action.

## 💡 Practical Oversight Routes

- **HMRC – AML Supervision:** enquire about any registered *relevant person* activities.  
- **FCA – Financial Promotions & PEP guidance:** cross-check sponsor advertising.  
- **NCA – SARs Enquiries:** confirm whether filings exist referencing the entities.  
- **Serious Fraud Office:** assess applicability of *Section 7 Bribery Act* (“failure to prevent”).  
- **OFSI / HM Treasury:** review sanctions compliance if foreign funds present.  
- **ICO:** check for data-processing registration and complaints.

## 🧭 Interpretation

The *Pitch @ Palace* model sits in a compliance grey zone:  
too political for commercial neutrality, too commercial for constitutional immunity.  
In such zones, due diligence must increase as prestige increases.  

Prestige is not proof of probity — it is a variable that raises the risk multiplier.
