*Existence within a system that records but does not recognise.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
A **zombie data subject** is an individual whose information is fully integrated into state and platform datasets yet who remains functionally excluded from human recognition or service access.  
The term describes a mode of **administrative half-life**: alive to databases, dead to care.  
It occurs when systemic categorisation fails, and the human falls between machine-readable options.

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Categorical Misfit** — personal data does not conform to existing eligibility schemas.  
- **Procedural Erasure** — every process assumes prior inclusion that never existed.  
- **Perpetual Verification Loop** — identity must be re-proven at every interface.  
- **Data Saturation Without Agency** — high informational presence, low functional power.  
- **Dependence on Human Advocacy** — survival requires a living intermediary at each step.

## 🔍 Analysis / Expression  

Within automated governance, zombie data subjects expose the brittle logic of *if–then* bureaucracy.  
When a person’s attributes fall outside enumerated categories, the system routes them into recursive error states: “refer,” “review,” “unverified.”  
Each review generates new records but no resolution, compounding informational density without outcome.  

This condition mirrors what disability theorists describe as **administrative disablement** — harm produced not by impairment but by system design.  
The individual becomes an *edge case in perpetuity*.

## 🧮 Flowchart — Categorical Dead End  

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q[Is the subject type A?] -->|No| R[Is the subject type B?]
    R -->|No| E[Else → Undefined]
    E --> L[Loop: "Insufficient category, request resubmission"]
    L --> Q
```
**Interpretation:**  
When data logic lacks an “else → create new path” clause, undefined subjects loop forever.  
Human advocacy temporarily overrides the error, but only until the next validation cycle.

## 🧬 Structural Consequences  

- **Legal:** Rights tied to categorical recognition become unenforceable.  
- **Administrative:** Case files multiply without closure; resource allocation stalls.  
- **Psychological:** Repetition of failed verification produces chronic exhaustion and identity dissonance.  
- **Ethical:** Systems accrue knowledge of harm without mandate to remedy it.  

To design humane infrastructure, *undefined* must be treated as a trigger for system revision, not user penalty.

*I Am a Zombie Data Subject* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the structural state in which individuals become informationally present but procedurally excluded, surviving only through continuous human advocacy.
