# 🧮 Monkey Work Node  
**First created:** 2025-10-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Low-effort, stabilising maintenance mode for when deep work isn’t possible.*

---

## 🐒 Purpose  

The **Monkey Work Node** is for days when thinking is hard, energy is low, or everything feels too charged.  
It keeps the project breathing by giving you *mechanical, low-stakes* tasks that still build order and continuity.  

Monkey work is grounding.  
It’s rhythm, not performance.

## 🧩 Light-Duty Tasks  

| Category | Examples | Why it Helps |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **File Hygiene** | Check filenames follow 🏮 House Style, fix broken cross-links | Small wins; builds quiet order |
| **Constellation Check** | Add 🌌 Constellations + ✨ Stardust to any node missing them | Keeps aesthetic coherence |
| **Metrics Log** | Paste latest clone/view counts into field log | Turns uncertainty into data |
| **Backup Sweep** | Export ZIPs, mirror to safe storage, record hash | Tangible security, visible closure |
| **Index Upkeep** | Add new nodes to `index.md` with emoji + one-line scope | Gentle momentum, rhythm work |
| **Formatting Pass** | Re-align headers, spacing, emoji order | Soothing repetition; no decisions |
| **Version Tagging** | Add `_v1.1` or update “Last updated” dates | Clear sense of progress |

## 🧘 Operational Notes  

- **Do not** try to “make meaning” here — that’s for high-energy days.  
- **Always** stop when you notice fatigue turning to frustration.  
- **Optional soundtrack:** anything rhythmic and non-verbal (rain loops, Lo-Fi beats, ambient sci-fi).  
- When in doubt: *rename, cross-link, or tidy*.
