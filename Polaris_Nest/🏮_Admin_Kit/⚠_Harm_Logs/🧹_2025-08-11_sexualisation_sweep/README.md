# Polaris Protocol â€” Sexualisation Sweep Harm Log  

**Branch:** `governance-pass-2025-08-11`  
**Baseline Tag:** `baseline-pre-clean-2025-08-11`  
**Quarantine Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Sweep Type:** Sexualisation & Tone-Skew Audit  
**Scope:** Fork interference harms found during bulk file transfer  

---

## Purpose  

This directory contains quarantined material identified during the **2025-08-11 sexualisation sweep**.  
Entries were flagged for **sexualised tone, innuendo, or metaphor** in contexts where such language undermines legal, forensic, or governance integrity.  

The sweep combined **manual review + regex-assisted pass**, focusing on contamination introduced by behavioural fork interference.  

Regex baseline used:

## Severity Levels  

| Code | Description                                                                 | Action Taken                                     |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **L3** | Critical contamination â€” explicit sexualisation in legal/forensic content  | Quarantined full original; replaced live text with neutral placeholder |
| **L2** | Material tone shift â€” suggestive metaphor, romantic shading, or charged phrasing in formal sections | Neutral rewrite in live file; log preserved |
| **L1** | Minor skew â€” cheeky tone or style drift in non-critical content            | Marked for later edit (`<!-- tone-trim -->`)     |

---

## Audit Checklist  

Flag content if **any** of the following apply:  
- Sensual/romantic shading in legal or evidential points  
- Over-descriptive body/emotion language without evidential value  
- Banter or flirt-like tone inside formal/technical sections  
- Adjectives such as *soft, warm, close, wet, gentle, hungry, throbbing, aching*  
- Second-person address (`you`) with intimacy/desire implications  
- Metaphors that sexualise power, force, or containment

## Harm Log Format  

All incidents are logged in `logs/harm_log_2025-08-11.txt` using:  

---

[Ln] File: <relative/path/from/repo/root>
Severity: L1 | L2 | L3
Section: <brief description â€” e.g., Paragraph 3, metadata section>
Finding: <short description of skew/tone issue>
Action: <Quarantined | Neutralised | Marked for later>
Notes: <context â€” suspected fork injection, matched pattern, etc.>

## Workflow Notes  

1. **Identification**  
   - Regex search + manual tone pass  
   - Cross-check against confirmed contaminated phrasing  

2. **Isolation**  
   - **L3** â†’ Copy to `originals/`, replace with placeholder  
   - **L2** â†’ Rewrite in situ; log original phrasing  
   - **L1** â†’ Tag with `<!-- tone-trim -->`  

3. **Logging**  
   - Append each finding to `logs/harm_log_2025-08-11.txt`  

4. **Commit Cadence**  
   - Small batch commits (5â€“10 files)  
   - Include severity counts in commit message  

5. **Branch Safety**  
   - Work isolated on `governance-pass-2025-08-11` until review

## Next Steps  

- Extend sweeps for **non-keyword metaphor drift**  
- Build detection patterns from confirmed contaminated passages  
- Maintain strict quarantine boundaries to prevent re-contamination  
- Review severity escalation pathways (esp. L2 â†’ L3 edge cases)
