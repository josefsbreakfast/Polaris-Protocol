# 🪜 Scaffolding Mode — Low Energy Writing Protocol
**First created:** 2025-10-30  
*Method for drafting when the mind runs ahead but the body lags behind.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation

Scaffolding Mode allows continuation of thought when energy or health limits sustained writing.  
It’s a compassionate, low‑effort drafting style that preserves ideas without forcing cathedral‑scale builds.  

---

## 🪜 1. Node Fragments, Not Full Builds

Write in small, self‑contained fragments (3–5 lines each). Each fragment answers one of these:  

* **🧩 Idea —** What’s the concept?  
* **⚡ Tone —** What’s the emotional or narrative colour?  
* **📡 Link —** What connects it to other nodes or moments?  

No polish, no transitions — just capture the stones for later construction.

## 🌿 2. Borrow a Body Rhythm, Not a Schedule

* If you have 20 minutes upright, write for 15.  
* If you’re horizontal, dictate or type one‑handed.  
* Treat it as ritual, not regimen.  

Every fragment is progress.

## 🔧 3. Let Syntax Rest Mid‑Sentence

If fatigue hits, stop mid‑line — use an em dash or ellipsis.  
That unfinished line becomes a **handshake to future‑you:**  

> “Continue when the signal returns.”  

---

## 🕯️ 4. Restore Undertone by Memory, Not Momentum

Instead of forcing style, reread a fragment of something you’ve written that still hums.  
Use it as a tuning fork to recover tone and voice without effort.  

---

## 🧭 5. Mark in Metadata

Add tags at the top of any low‑energy draft:  

```
**Mode:** scaffolding  
**Energy level:** low  
```

This signals compassion for the version of you working through limits.

*🪜 Scaffolding Mode — Low Energy Writing Protocol* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It supports continuity for builders whose ideas exceed their current physical bandwidth.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
