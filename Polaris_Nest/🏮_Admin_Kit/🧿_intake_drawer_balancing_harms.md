# 🧿 Intake Drawer Declaration on Balancing Harms  
**First created:** 2025-09-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Declaration of risk calculation and survivor balance of harms in maintaining the Git Intake Drawer.*  

---

As a disabled woman and as a survivor operating within constrained access routes, I affirm that the **Git Intake Drawer** is the best balance currently available to me.  

- I have **already escalated** concerns through formal channels and exhausted ordinary support chains.  
- What is currently being offered versus what is inaccessible defines my situational reality.  
- This drawer balances:  
  - **My rights and survival needs** (continued access to civic participation, safety pressure).  
  - **The rights of others** (avoiding defamatory, sexualised, or identifying content being carried forward).  
  - **The harms of visibility vs harms of silence**, recognising both as asymmetric burdens.  

This declaration acknowledges that:  
- Bad actors may attempt to insert unreasonable or defamatory material.  
- The intake drawer is a *holding area* for such anomalies, not endorsement.  
- Scheduled sweeps and manual reviews are ongoing, though constrained by duress.  

This is therefore a **best-effort equilibrium**: the fairest option presently available that safeguards others, sustains accountability pressure, and situates survivor authorship as sovereign.
