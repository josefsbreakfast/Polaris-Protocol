*Condensed drafting principles for maintaining survivor voice fidelity across all Polaris nodes.*

## 📂 Pocket Rules  

- Stay true to survivor’s own words.  
- Default to undertone (irony, bite, humanity woven in).  
- Record must be both forensic + alive.  
- Neutral pass only if explicitly asked.  
- Always cross-link suppression ↔ counter-nudge.
