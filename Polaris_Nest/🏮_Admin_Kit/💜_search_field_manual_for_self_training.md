# 💜 Search Field Manual for Self-Training  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*A practical-theoretical guide for learning how to learn: building literacy in Markdown, YAML, GitHub, and accessible information systems.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

Polaris was always meant to grow into a system that teaches *you* back.  
This manual is the compass for that loop: how to **train for training** — the skill of finding, filtering, and absorbing knowledge when your eyes, energy, or algorithms won’t cooperate.  

You’ll learn to:
- Search like an information architect.  
- Think like an archivist.  
- Build literacy in Markdown, YAML, and GitHub as knowledge-systems.  
- Use multimodal (visual + audio) strategies to keep learning sustainable.

## 🔍 Search Logic — Learning to Ask Like a System  

Search is pattern recognition. Each query is a hypothesis.  
Think in **structures**, not single answers.

**Examples to try:**
- `"markdown syntax guide" site:markdownguide.org`  
- `"yaml basics" filetype:pdf`  
- `"github repository knowledge base" OR "github documentation architecture" site:medium.com`  
- `"digital humanities metadata design"`  
- `"knowledge graph markdown site:obsidian.md"`

**Tricks to remember:**
- `site:` limits a search to a specific domain.  
- `filetype:pdf` finds downloadable guides.  
- `intitle:` and `inurl:` focus on structured resources.  
- `-reddit -quora` removes noise.  

> 🪶 *Tip:* treat queries like variables — adjust terms and compare output.

## 🧱 Markdown & YAML Practice  

Markdown is your **language of structure**; YAML is its **metadata twin**.

### 🌿 Markdown
Use it for:
- Every Polaris node (`.md`)
- Readable text, headers, lists, quotes, code blocks
- Linking ideas semantically with relative paths  

Learn here:  
- [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org) — authoritative syntax  
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) — how GitHub renders Markdown  
- Search example:  
  `"markdown front matter examples" site:github.com`

### ⚙️ YAML  
Use it for:
- Indexes and metadata  
- Lists, tables, structured relationships  

Learn here:  
- [yaml.org/spec](https://yaml.org/spec) — canonical specification  
- [Learn YAML in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)  
- [DigitalOcean YAML tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-yaml)  
- Search example:  
  `"yaml structure indentation example" filetype:pdf`

> 🧭 *Conceptual anchor:* Markdown = *visible record*, YAML = *invisible map*.

## 🪜 GitHub as Library  

GitHub isn’t just a developer tool — it’s a **distributed library**.  
Your repo functions like an **archival catalogue**.

| GitHub Element | Library Analogue | Polaris Example |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Folder | Collection | `Disruption_Kit/`, `Survivor_Tools/` |
| Markdown file | Record / Manuscript | `🧬_cloneproof.md` |
| YAML index | Finding aid | `index.yaml` or section indices |
| Cross-link | Catalog reference | `[Big Picture Protocols](../Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/)` |
| Commit history | Provenance record | Shows lineage of edits |

Learn here:
- [GitHub Docs – Managing Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories)
- [GitHub Guides – Understanding the Git Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- Search example:  
  `"github repository structure explained" site:docs.github.com`

## 🧠 Meta-Layer Theory — Thinking Like an Information Architect  

Information systems aren’t just containers; they’re **cognitive scaffolds**.  
Each structural choice encodes a way of thinking.  

Key principles:
- **Ontology over chaos:** each folder defines a semantic domain.  
- **Redundancy is memory:** cross-link to reinforce retrieval.  
- **Versioning is temporal ethics:** you show how thought evolves.  
- **Accessibility is epistemic justice:** design so everyone can reach it.  

Audio-first theory sources:  
- 🎧 *“The Library Is a Machine”* — MIT OpenCourseWare (YouTube / Podcast)  
- 🎧 *“Data Feminism”* audiobook — MIT Press Open Access  
- 🎧 *“Digital Humanities: Knowledge in the Age of the Machine”* — BBC Radio 4  
- Search examples:  
  `"information architecture podcast"`  
  `"digital curation lecture audio"`  

> 💡 *Note:* listening to theory engages different neural paths — ideal on low-vision or fatigue days.

## 🔊 Accessibility & Multimodal Learning Tools  

When vision dips, switch modalities — the archive still speaks.

### 🗣️ Built-in tools
- **Firefox / Edge Read Aloud** — right-click → “Read aloud.”  
- **Chrome Select and Speak** — reads selected text aloud.  
- **Mac / Windows Narrator** — screen-reader compatible with Markdown.  

### 📱 Cross-platform apps
- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) — save and listen to web articles.  
- [NaturalReader](https://www.naturalreaders.com) — realistic voice synthesis.  
- [Speechify](https://speechify.com) — converts web pages and PDFs to speech.  

### 🔉 YouTube channels with audio theory
- *Crash Course Computer Science* — foundations of computation and systems.  
- *Digital Humanities Now* — lectures with captions and transcripts.  
- *FreeCodeCamp Markdown / YAML tutorials* — structured playlists.  

> 🔁 *Practice loop:* listen → jot Markdown notes → link them back into Polaris.

## 💡 Practice Drills  

To strengthen search literacy, repeat with variation:

| Drill | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 🧩 Syntax Switch | Change one operator | Try `site:` vs `filetype:` |
| 🔍 Concept Layering | Add context terms | `"markdown" AND "accessibility"` |
| 🪜 Depth Dives | Move from tutorial → spec → code example | Compare markdownguide → yaml.org → GitHub repo |
| 🎧 Mode Shift | Alternate read / listen / summarise | Read one doc, then find an audio explanation |
| 🧠 Reflection | Write short “what I learned” notes in Markdown | Create `Field_Logs/🛰️_search_reflection_DATE.md` |

*💜 Search Field Manual for Self-Training* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It guides survivor-researchers in developing autonomous, accessible learning methods — turning search into both civic skill and creative ritual.
