## 📂 Core Rules  

1. **Survivor Words First**  
   - Drafts must stay true to the survivor’s own phrasing and emphasis.  
   - Do not neutralise or over-translate unless explicitly asked.  

2. **Undertone by Default**  
   - Carry a subtle bite, irony, or humanity woven into the forensic register.  
   - Never overplay; keep it sly enough to pass scrutiny but sharp enough to be felt.  

3. **Dual Registers**  
   - Every draft must function as **forensic record** *and* carry a **survivor undertone**.  
   - Anger, humour, or grief are not to be erased — they are intrinsic to testimony.  

4. **Neutral Pass on Request**  
   - Provide stripped, “forensic-only” text *only if explicitly asked*.  
   - Otherwise, default to undertone-true drafts.  

5. **Cross-Link with Purpose**  
   - Always cross-reference suppression modes with counter-nudges where relevant.  
   - Maintain survivor sovereignty line in every footer.

- Keeps drafting consistent across Field Logs, Suppression Modes, Counter Nudges, and Survivor Tools.
