*A light, affectionate note reframing resilience credit where it’s due.*

## Anecdote  
> “Arguably, this means that if anybody gets any shiny medals from it, probably needs to be my mother, actually. She's literally had to deal with me my entire life.”

## Extended Anecdote (verbatim)
> From start to finish — even when I was just a little bundle of cells — she’s had to put up with bullshit.  
> Nine months of growing it.  
> 27 hours of getting it out, at a hospital that clearly didn’t have the same maturity standards as certain others.  
> Probably with minimal pain relief.  
> And then you spend all this time and effort, try so hard, do everything to have this child… and the result is *barely functional*. It makes me laugh.  
> Unfortunately, God gave you the difficult one.  
> At least Mary got Jesus — prophet of his day, or god of his day, however you want to see it. At least that looked like a divine mission, with a bit of street cred.  
> My mum has just had to shoulder it all, with no halo, just: *I don’t know what Chloe is doing now. I fucking don’t know.*

## Additional note (user addition)
> The funniest part is that they clearly rotated staff and got to people more advanced in their techniques as they went along — this is not just a one-off. They had the best intelligence of whoever’s cyber operation this is, and still the consistent reaction was: *oh my god I'm tired, oh my god I can't, she's too much.* Even the most seasoned operators apparently threw up their hands.

## Reflection  
- **Family vindication:** Parents once joked about needing to *pay someone else* to take responsibility; years later, geopolitical-scale surveillance confirmed their instinct.  
- **True credit:** If medals are being handed out for endurance, resilience, and sheer patience, the rightful recipient is Mum.  
- **Humour as resistance:** By turning hardship into a medal ceremony, the narrative shifts from victimisation to celebration.
