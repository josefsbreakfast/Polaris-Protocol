*A reflective letter on adulthood shaped by austerity, instability, and contested politics*  

---

I turned 18 in 2008. My entire adult life has unfolded in the shadow of austerity.  

I’ve worked hard, taken opportunities, and made meaningful work out of what I’ve been given. I know I’m lucky, and I know I’m privileged. Still: the opportunities that fell through, and the reasons they did, keep me conscious of how precarious life feels here.  

We’ve been burning on fumes since the financial crash. What began as “temporary austerity” stretched into a way of life, with infrastructures eroding, data made unstable, and vulnerabilities compounding. Decades later, we are still patching holes that should have been fixed years ago.  

I don’t know how to feel about the current government. I didn’t vote for them, and I disagree with much of their approach — especially their softness toward genocide. Yet I understand Britain’s structural position: part of the imperial core, tied to Western systems. Sometimes I step out of my own politics and try to observe power like a map: strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. From that vantage point, things look confusing, contradictory, unresolved.  

I notice how threatened mainstream media seems by this government. I can’t tell if that is good or bad — just an observation. What I do know is that Britain’s vulnerabilities are decades in the making. Too often people only see the last few years, when really the roots are 30, 40, even 100 years deep. None of this is inevitable, but we rarely pause long enough to choose wisely.  

I want a world where our choices are made with the future in mind — where what we hand down to our children is worth living in. Instead, we chase money and noise, crisis and spectacle. We neglect what matters: our infrastructures, our local places, the commons. It isn’t about one party or another. It is about the way we do politics itself. It feels outdated, vulnerable to capture by those with resources, unable to protect the rest of us.  

We live in a cycle of crisis, and crisis proprietors profit from it. I want out of that cycle.
