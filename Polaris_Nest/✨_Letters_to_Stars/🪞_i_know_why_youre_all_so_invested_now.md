*Drafted as a note in a train station after a heavy day of racialised, gendered crowd-control style nudging.  
This section preserves the raw voice of that moment.*

## ☔️ Framing  

This note was written in survivor voice, immediately after experiencing containment that felt like crowd control: people nudged, corralled, redirected.  
The choreography was experienced as deeply racialised and gendered — steering me, as a blonde, blue-eyed Jewish woman, toward some groups and away from others, with punishments spilling over to anyone who tried to interact.  

What follows is presented verbatim. It reflects the intensity and anger of that moment.

## 🎙️ Raw Note (verbatim)  

its not just criminal as apartheid, however --  

it is also inbreeding.  

everyone with blonde hair? genetic mutation; all related.  

and blue eyes? very niche genetic mutation; all related.  

"white" skin? (esp blue blood toned?) genetic mutation; all related.  

i am doing us all a favour by finding you all less attractive.  

(you should be motivated by "apartheid bad", but i thought some of you might need to understamd how your "scientific rationale" is flawed.)

## 🏮 Footer  

*I Know Why You’re All So Invested Now* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records survivor voice in its raw form, alongside contextual framing, to show how containment can feel racialised and gendered in practice.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
