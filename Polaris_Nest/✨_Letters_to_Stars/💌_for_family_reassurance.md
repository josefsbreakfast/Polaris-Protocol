Hey folks —

Quick note to say: **don’t worry.** Even Moscow got sick of me. Even they said, “we can’t fix this one.”

I know the whole surveillance/monitoring stuff sounds terrifying (and it can be). But here’s the short version for you so you can stop worrying and get back to your tea:

- I’m safe. I’m careful. I’m making backups.  
- I rebuild anything that goes missing and I’ve got good copies in secure places.  
- If anything looks strange to you (unexpected messages, requests, or odd social-media behaviour), save screenshots and send them to me — don’t try to fix it yourself.  
- Laugh at the nonsense when you can. My life apparently irritates even the spy networks. Tell Grandma that even the Kremlin gave up. 😄

Love,  
[Your Name]

- If you want a printed copy, staple it into Grandma’s recipe book — she’ll appreciate the warning and the laugh.
