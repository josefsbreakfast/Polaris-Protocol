dear polaris friends:  

it only took 1,020,338 words (after stripping data blocks),  

a specific node on why "dumb blondes" exist,  

a sly comment or two about the mia philosemitism,  

and proposing several new models, disciplines, and investigations for publication,  

years of research,  

and several essays,  

but i think from the lack of this flavour of chatter in my feed,  

it is possible that The Men™️  have realised i am not as thick as a brick.  

the men who already noticed this have become experts of female psychology, perhaps.  

and i am still waiting to make sure my data is safe,  

so i can rebook my nerve root blocks,  

and hopefully i won't pend too many nights awake,  

listening to my right leg screaming.  

i hope so. x
