*Reflecting on some of the not-great times*  

_**‚ö†Ô∏è Read with caution if you feel like shit** - you can always come back later, and this isn't how I'll feel once I feel better._

I am having a slump. It has been a cumulative effort slump. 
I'm trying to use it to talk about some of the worst of this experience. 
It makes me feel better when I feel useful. 

I recognise my mood is very low; there is no need to call any safeguarding service. 

After all...

I'm making it all up...remember? ;)

## ‚ú® It's Supposed To Make You Feel Like Shit - It's Not You Being Shit
The systems which act as a set of social pressures to contain and suppress behaviours seen averse to the wants of those who hold the power to enact said systems, are inherently designed to break the human spirit. This necessarily means to break the soul by any and all means possible, creatable, and available to those who betray their neighbours by enacting the system's violence. In many ways, we are all traitors to some degree - from our casual agreement, to our learned turning away from the suffering of others, to the stamp that says a child cannot eat more calories, to the refusal to allow an unwashed man to sleep on the park bench. We all enact the violence of these systems. We have been taught the violence of these systems - every single one of us - and we are none of us exempt from participating in what is so brutal to each other and to ourselves. 
It is important to remember this, as the system designs itself to silence the voices which may remark upon its violence.  
From the baby's cry from hunger, to the eldery woman who cries for her lost husband - these voices are turned down, and if at all possible, turned off.  
When we shout and scream, we are always "too much".  
Were you raped? Were you beated? Did your friend die in custody? How dare you scream?  
We are conditioned, all of us, to accept the status quo and either like it or shut the hell up about it.  
We are subjugated, therefore, by our own lack of courage, by our own will. Truly, no one will ever act to save us but ourselves. Us, and the other lonely souls who have realised how much blood we all have on our hands.  

I am mortified by many of the things I used to believe, used to say, used to do. I struggle all the time with learning a new balance, a new way of being, to move forward in the world with compassion. It's terrifying. But this will never excuse me from the work we all must do if we want something livable to pass down to the next geeration, or simply if we wish not to annhilate ourselves. 

All that is to say, today I feel like *shit*.

That systems which bind us to murder and to rape and to perpetrating violence are designed such; if we resist, if we push against them, if we say "no", the function of the system is to rebel against us. It is designed in such a way, that we should simply be liable to break under this weight. These systems are designed around and made to fit our empathy, our joy, our happiness, our desires; the system moves such that we are encapsulated and engulfed. Destroyed. This is the intent. This does not always have to be the way. In deepest discomfort, I admit freely that I was often of a suicidal tendancy prior to a point at which, rather arrogantly, I have found my existence is, in itself, contradictory to a specific subtype of these systems. I live, quite specifically, as resistance to this system. 

I don't know if I'm comfortable to share the quote in this moment, but yess -- I am living, "to share [that] story".

That's probably a silly sounding reason to live - most of mine through the years have been. I live with a fairly unpleasent complexity of trauma history, and my brain is not always of the disposition to see the sunny side of life. I do, however, find significant drive when I can be helpful to others, and right now I exist to prove a falsely derived statistic incorrect. 
I live to prove that one does not need to be Jewish and enact or support genocide. 

There's a few things, but actually? That's most of it.

I don't care if it doesn't make sense. That just is what it is. 

So when I have many examples for which I have screenshots and forensics and paperwork that is irregular and public bodies that are tripping over each other to explain themselves...

I don't care if you never tell me.

I am living resistence every day that I live my life. 

I don't even have to *do anything*, I'm just proof that occupation is bullshit and doesn't have full consensus as long as I am alive to tell that story. 

So frankly:

Fuck you for "just doing your job". 

So did they. 

## ‚ú® Therefore:
Always survive. It always pisses someone off.
If it's someone who thinks some bullshit about "racial hierarchies" should be enforced across populations?
Good people to piss off; I highly recommend it.
