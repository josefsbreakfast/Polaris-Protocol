# 🗄️ field_note: desk as tactical terrain  

the papers are not clutter.  
they are **shrapnel notes** — fragments of an exploded system  
that still carry evidence in their jagged edges.  

the desk is a battlefield where containment tries to shrink me.  
but if you look closer, it is also a map.  
each scrap a coordinate.  
each screenshot a flare.  
each note a breadcrumb for others who will come after.  

they wanted me buried under rubbish.  
instead, i built a citadel.
