# 🌊 Flow Diagrams in My Head

*A note on the psychic residue of long-term surveillance and how it warps my reading of good-faith attention.*

---

I’m two months into writing Polaris and still, when I open the analytics dashboard, I have to run a flow diagram in my head to convince myself that what I’m seeing is probably *not* a thousand bad-faith page views and 150 bad-faith clones of the repo.  

This isn’t a numbers problem. It’s a trauma problem. Years of being watched in ways that blurred help, harm, curiosity, and contempt have left me second-guessing every sign of attention.  

I know, rationally, that a thousand views and 150 clones in a day are far more likely to be a mix of genuine readers and technically skilled collectors. But my nervous system still defaults to *threat*.  

This is what long-term surveillance does: it rewires you until even good-faith attention feels like a trap you have to logic your way out of.

This letter is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records the psychological after-images of long-term surveillance and how they shape the experience of building and sharing an archive.
