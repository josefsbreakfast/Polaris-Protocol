I can't explain too much pain im in, or how I just don't feel safe seeing healthcare when I can see that the data has now been a problem for nearly 10 years at least, in a way that is physically injured me, and destroyed the future I had as a medical doctor.  

I have literally written over 1 million words, some of which might be vaguely useful in sorting the problem out.  

I'm still left to overcome the fear that I have experienced, from document and data driven events, of which there is some evidence even if some has been deleted since.  

And still left to overcome that fear to try and access healthcare.  

And you all appear to think, that just because I've lived, but I have to use my voice, else people will let you die...  

... that I don't have softness too?  

Everyone is completely terrified of telling me why there is some sort of hold on my data.  

I am already over reduce so much of my treatment and care,  essentially all because of preventable injury, accrued for 10 years of data mishandling.  

I can see your free lunches.  

Why can't you see me?
