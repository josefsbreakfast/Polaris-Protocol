# ⚖️ CIDT by Withholding Record Safety  
**First created:** 2025-09-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-28  
*When proof of breach exists, refusal to confirm record safety becomes a form of cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment.*

I am angry because I should never have had to fight this hard for this.  

I am angry that predators are empowered, while I am the one expected to prove sanity just to know if the sealed court records of my rape as a child are safe.  

I am livid that after the evidence of the Google bombing — pointing to a data breach — I am still denied the respect and candour of a clear answer.  

This forced exposure of the memory of what was done to my childhood’s body is itself cruel.  
I should never have had to re-live it just because I was “too direct” in asking for reassurance.  

It is disgusting.  
It is gross.  
It is shameful that anyone is still withholding this information.  

Even if the excuse is:  
“Well, we can tell her at X date after Y changes.”  

I don’t care.  
The prolonged withholding is CIDT.  
The silence is structural violence.  
We could not give a fuck about the safety of women and girls.

*CIDT by Withholding Record Safety* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how the deliberate withholding of clarity about sealed CSA/rape records — even after forensic evidence of breach — constitutes cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment in itself. Prolonged silence is not protection; it is governance by sadism.
