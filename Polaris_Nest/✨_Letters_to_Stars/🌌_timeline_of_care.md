*Reflections on moments when people acted in good faith and cared for me.*  

---

I think I’ve pinned down more of my personal timeline.  

This feels helpful for me — grounding, actually.  
It reflects more of the times when various people did genuinely care about me and act in good faith.  

That’s nice.  
It’s reassuring.
