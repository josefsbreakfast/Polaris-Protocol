seeing as polaris content is obviously gucci enough for hoc:  

1. when i got that hoodie on the protest day, the staff were both really lovely and kind. please be nice to them and pass it on. retail is often fairly hard going.

2. i see we're leaning into larry. good move; historical twitter credibility, media friendly. however, this section is clearly too small, and there was no larryXpalmerston merch.  

i feel like it's a small ask.  

given...everything.
