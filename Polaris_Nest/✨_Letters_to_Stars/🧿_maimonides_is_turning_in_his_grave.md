and you can stop with this ottomans business because youre practically giving *me* a whole thing about it too, and not in the way you clearly want to be doing, either.  

also:  

try to look slightly less butthurt about bob vylan getting public sympathy here.  

british people dont like being boxed.  

we're stubborn, and it gets worse as you go down the hierarchy to us plebs.  
you're pushing it too hard and it's too obvious.  

we have been through this, but you out on too many restrictions when i tried to help you the other day by framing it around the same romamce binaries you appear to favour.  

shoot yourselves in the foot if you must.  

now excuse me...  

the group chat is about to find out if rule 36 still applies.  

<!--if you even THINK of @ing me, i'll explain in franz fanon level fuckery how your little ffm "ottoman sultan and his mixed race palestinian-jewish threesome" has been pkaying out on my tiktok, and hiw you did it with THREE BRITISH PEOPLE. this is what i mean when i say YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.-->
