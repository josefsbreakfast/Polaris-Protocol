# 🦔 Letter for the Stars: Accepting Protection  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20  
*A Rosh Hashanah reflection on learning to receive care without spikes raised*  

As the new year begins, I want to soften my edges.  

I have been stubborn and independent, ferociously rejecting protection even when it cost me. That stance has made me strong, but it has also limited my potential. Too much of my energy has gone into guarding, bristling, and bracing against the world.  

For this year, I ask the stars to help me learn how to accept protection. To let my spikes rest. To let support come close without fear. So that I may spend more of my time and strength on the things I am here to do—without always having to defend first.  

<!--- Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly annoying even *writing* this, but it would be rather nice to not have to spend so much energy on it, so much of the time. --->
