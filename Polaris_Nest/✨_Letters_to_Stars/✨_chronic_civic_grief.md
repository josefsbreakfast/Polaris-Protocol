*A letter about living in a country that is decaying without grace, and the exhaustion of being unable to leave*  

---

I know on some deeper level: I am tired.  

My adult life has been spent watching my country decay, and it is not doing it in a graceful way. It is not bowing out with dignity; it is stumbling, breaking, burning through what’s left.  

This is what I mean by **chronic civic grief**. It is not the sharp shock of a single disaster. It is the long, weary ache of watching infrastructures, politics, and public life deteriorate year by year, knowing it could be otherwise.  

I have dreamed of emigrating for many years. But it is not simple. Money is tight; opportunities are fenced off. Every time I get close to the catalytic threshold that would let me leave, I seem to get caught in small but exhausting traps — administrative blocks, unstable work, sudden costs.  

I am not naïve. I know no country is perfect. But it is its own kind of wound to feel trapped in a place that has been running on fumes since 2008, to know that your adulthood has unfolded in a state that cannot or will not repair itself, and to carry that grief every day.  

I am no child, but I am being denied an adulthood.

*Chronic Civic Grief* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records testimony of exhaustion and longing: a survivor’s reflection on life in a country in slow collapse, and the pain of being unable to cross the threshold to leave.
