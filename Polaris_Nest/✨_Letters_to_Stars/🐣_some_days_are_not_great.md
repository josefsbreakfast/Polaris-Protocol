some days are not great

some dats are very much not okay

i try to be pisitive and upbeat and laugh and have fun.

but some days?

some days just really suck.

thats normal for head-weather. sometimes it just rains.

i feel like because this is online, i have to say to be sensible if its flooding and like, maybe try not to swim in torrential currents.

it would be cool if it were so easy. i know its hard.

and this is the pount of containment systems.

youre suppised to feel like the wirld is terrible.

youre supposed to allow the creeping sense that maybe no one will ever:
want you
tolerate you
help you
save you
speak to you
look after you
care for you
like you

even dislike you - youre suppised to feel like a blip.

its like that box for punishment, from restaurant at the end of the universe (i think it was book 2?) where zaphod beeblebrox only survives because the party happen to be in a parallel universe at that particular monentbthat was literally made for him.

so, in a rarity, he survives, because he sees himself exactly how the universe seems him in that moment, which is inherentoy in line with how the insufferable zaphod has always seen himself.

but our box is not zaphod's.

its supposed to drive is mad, believing we are not just nothing, but indescribably small.

a speck has more oomph.

this is why these contaient sustems are so dangerous.

they badically replicate and induce the very wirst of ckinical depression.

thats why theyre not impressive to me.

my brain can literally do that alk be itself.

i see people who apoear to have psychosis induced from digital tools.

im not saying that cannot be done.

again: its a lot less impressive when you realise its a bunch of weird guys who, in another job, would be relegated to the chan boards.

i refuse to wnd my life ober some nitwit on his 8th can of energy blindness.

im going out hurtling 80km/hr down a mountain, or off my tits on a beautiful palliative subcut in my 80s.

im not going because some weird dudes online kep telling me im worthless.

im not having "cause of death: morons" on my death certificate.

fuck that.
