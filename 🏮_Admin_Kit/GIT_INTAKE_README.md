# 🏮 Git Intake Drawer Readme  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Explains the purpose of the Git Intake Drawer as a temporary holding zone.*  

---

The **Git Intake Drawer** is a staging area.  
Files appear here first before they are checked, reformatted, and routed into the correct Polaris folders.  

This space is intentionally **untidy**.  
It records the transition between intake and permanent archive.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Git Intake Drawer Readme* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the purpose of the intake space as a temporary buffer, not a permanent home.
