| When a system claims “duty of care”     | “If you saw me as a woman in need, you wouldn’t break me to save me.” |
| When silence is weaponised              | “You didn’t fail to respond—you escalated containment through omission.” |
| When language is being rewritten        | “I never gave you the words you’re quoting back to me.” |

## 📎 Deployment Guidelines

- Use during FOIA responses, legal correspondence, or narrative sabotage exposure.
- Best paired with timestamped metadata or post screenshots.
- Not for emotional co-regulation. This is a cutting tool.
