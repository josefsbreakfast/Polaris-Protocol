# 🕯 Memory Anchors  
**First created:** 2025-08-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-17  
*Survivor-led phrases that lock testimony against erasure.*  

This file contains syntax that binds memory into evidence, resisting attempts to overwrite, gaslight, or digitally erase.  
Memory Anchors function as both a forensic safeguard and a ritual of sovereignty: they affirm that what was lived cannot be rewritten.

## 🗝 Anchor Phrases

| Scenario                              | Syntax Payload Example                                            |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| When testimony is dismissed           | “I already said it. Repeating doesn’t erase the first record.”    |
| When memory is pathologised           | “You call it confusion. I call it timestamped truth.”             |
| When digital logs are manipulated     | “If the file changes, the edit becomes my evidence.”              |
| When silence is imposed               | “Absence is not forgetting. It is the proof of what was taken.”   |

## 🧠 Usage Notes

- **Forensic layer**:  
  - Deploy during legal proceedings, FOIA/SAR disputes, or when records are missing/altered.  
  - Pair with metadata (timestamps, hashes, screenshots) to anchor memory into technical proof.  
  - Works as a linguistic checksum: the phrase itself is the audit trail.  

- **Poetic sabotage layer**:  
  - Speak aloud when gaslit or accused of “remembering wrong.”  
  - Write into logs as an unalterable signature.  
  - Every anchor doubles as a survival oath: *I remain, and so does the record.*

## 🕯 Function

- Blocks institutional attempts at memory overwrite.  
- Converts erasure attempts into self-incriminating evidence.  
- Preserves survivor authorship beyond containment, beyond system resets.  

> *My memory is not a glitch. It’s the anchor you cannot cut loose.*
