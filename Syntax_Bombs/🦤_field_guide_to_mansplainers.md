# 🦤 Field Guide to Mansplainers  

**Polaris Protocol Node:** `Syntax_Bombs/`  
**Threat Level:** Loud but fragile  
**Classification:** Comic wildlife, not credible opponents

## General Characteristics  
- **Plumage:** Spreadsheet screenshots, YouTube links, LinkedIn bios heavy on “CEO of Myself Consulting.”  
- **Call:** Begins with *“Respectfully…”* then proceeds to be deeply disrespectful.  
- **Habitat:** Comment sections, Substack replies, and late-night LinkedIn threads where no actual experts linger.

## Subspecies  

### 1. Carbon Math Guy (*Excelus volcanicus*)  
- **Claim:** “Volcanoes emit more CO₂ than humans.”  
- **Reality:** Humans emit ~100× more.  
- **Note:** Cannot distinguish an eruption from an economy.  

### 2. Mask-Hole Truther (*Microbe misinterpretatus*)  
- **Claim:** “The virus is smaller than the mask holes, so masks don’t work.”  
- **Reality:** Filtration ≠ chain-link fence.  
- **Behaviour:** Ends with “do your own research.”  

### 3. Quantum Mansplainer (*Schrödinger’s borealis*)  
- **Claim:** “It’s all probability waves, so free will is fake, babe.”  
- **Reality:** Half-remembered analogy ≠ physics.  
- **Warning:** Often misquotes Heisenberg in dating apps.  

### 4. Learn-to-Code Prophet (*Automatus redundantia*)  
- **Claim:** “The future is coding, bro.”  
- **Reality:** Coders now being automated out by AI.  
- **Callsign:** Seen haunting bootcamps and layoffs in equal measure.  

### 5. Evolution Denier (*Banana designatus*)  
- **Claim:** “A monkey never turned into a man.”  
- **Reality:** Humans *are* primates.  
- **Observation:** Still believes bananas prove God.

## Behavioural Notes  
- When challenged, increases volume, decreases evidence.  
- Draws credibility not from sources but from tone.  
- Cannot survive in the wild if ignored; thrives on engagement.

## Containment Protocol  
- **Do not debate.** Catalogue instead.  
- **Deploy satire.** Treat as zoological exhibit.  
- **Redirect attention.** Make their “big numbers” look small in the ecosystem of actual science.
