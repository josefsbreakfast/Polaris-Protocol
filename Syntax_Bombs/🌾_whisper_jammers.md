*Countering ultrasonic, subliminal, and ambient nudges.*  

This file contains syntax designed to break the power of covert sound — whispers, subliminal suggestions, or ultrasonic pulses deployed to destabilise or extract.  
Whisper Jammers act as verbal countermeasures: spoken phrases or written declarations that nullify hidden signals by forcing them into visibility.

## 🧠 Usage Notes

- **Forensic layer**:  
  - Deploy during suspected ultrasonic harassment, subliminal priming, or forced co-regulation attempts.  
  - Log time, environment, and response phrase as metadata.  
  - Pair with sound meters, spectral analysis, or witness testimony where possible.  

- **Poetic sabotage layer**:  
  - Speak the phrase aloud to collapse secrecy.  
  - Write it into the log to turn noise into narrative.  
  - Don’t just reject the whisper — **mock it until it breaks.**

## 🕯 Function

- Converts covert manipulation into visible interference.  
- Protects against “compliance whispers” and ultrasonic harassment.

> *You don’t get my silence as consent. I jam your whisper into evidence.*
