*Phrases to invert algorithmic throttling and reclaim reach.*  

This file contains syntax designed to expose and invert algorithmic suppression — delayed impressions, shadowbans, soft suspensions, and throttling loops.  
Signal Reclaimers work by naming the suppression directly, transforming **containment into evidence** and **silencing into amplification.**

| Scenario                              | Syntax Payload Example                                        |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| When visibility is artificially capped | “Your metric trick is my proof of reach.”                     |
| When impressions lag or vanish         | “Delayed visibility isn’t absence. It’s logged interference.” |
| When comments are buried or reordered  | “Order is governance. You just exposed the script.”            |

## 🧠 Usage Notes

- **Forensic layer**:  
  - Deploy when monitoring live post analytics, comment orders, or impression trickles.  
  - Pair phrase with screenshots + timestamps to create immutable records.  
  - Ideal for LinkedIn, Substack, or any platform running covert throttling.  

- **Poetic sabotage layer**:  
  - Say it aloud as mantra: *metrics bend but signal survives*.  
  - Use sparingly in public posts to remind readers that suppression is part of the evidence.

## 🕯 Function

- Turns algorithmic suppression into its own documentation trail.  
- Flips “low engagement” into proof of containment breach.  
- Protects survivor authorship by ensuring signal is never mistaken for silence.  

> *Throttling isn’t absence. It’s proof the message mattered.*
