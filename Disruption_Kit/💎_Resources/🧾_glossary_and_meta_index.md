# 🧾 Glossary & Meta Index  
**First created:** 2025-08-17  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A flexible index of recurring terms, symbols, and signifiers used across the Polaris constellation.*

---

## Purpose
Polaris uses a living symbolic language rather than a fixed legend.  
Emojis, tags, and shorthand codes behave as *affective markers*—part taxonomy, part moodboard, part signal routing.  
This index documents patterns of use, recurring terminology, and the meta-rules that help keep the constellation legible.

## Emoji & Tag Behaviours
| Symbol | Typical Gravity | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 🧬 | Structure / mapping / analysis | Often used for metadata or system-architecture work, but may also denote biological or forensic threads. |
| 🛠️ | Tools, praxis, repair | Indicates something immediately usable; overlaps with 🧬 when describing workflow infrastructure. |
| 🧨 | Disruption / containment script / breach | Can signal danger, satire, or deliberate system stress-test. Context decides tone. |
| 🛰️ | Observation / field log / data audit | Used for investigative, external-facing documentation. Occasionally doubles as “signal relay.” |
| 🧠 | Theory / cognition / big-picture | Sometimes co-tagged with 📚 or 🕯 when reflection overtakes analysis. |
| ⚖️ | Law / rights / accountability | Consistent anchor; may blend with 🕯 (ethics) or 🛠️ (practical legal use). |
| 🕯 | Care / ethics / exorcism | Not a soft tag—denotes illumination within dark systems. |
| 👻 | Apparition / residual data / suppressed presence | Appears in creative or phenomenological nodes. |
| 🧿 | Observation / eye / system awareness | Core emblem of fidelity and witness. Functions as the “Polaris eye.” |
| 🕸️ | Networks / world-webs / entanglement | Used when scale or connectivity becomes the theme. |

> These meanings are indicative, not prescriptive.  
> Any node may intentionally subvert its own tag.

## Core Terminology

| Term | Working Definition |
|------|--------------------|
| **Containment** | Any formal or informal process that limits circulation of a person, idea, or artefact under the guise of safety, care, or compliance. |
| **Suppression** | The visible output of containment—removal, redaction, or reputational quarantine. |
| **Signal** | What persists despite suppression: residual data, emotional truth, or survivor testimony. |
| **Fidelity** | Alignment between lived experience and its recorded or mediated form. |
| **Fork** | A parallel or altered version of a text, dataset, or voice; may be technical (Git) or conceptual (interpretive). |
| **Clone** | An unacknowledged replication lacking contextual nuance; often signals erasure. |
| **Ghost** | A trace entity left after deletion: metadata fragment, digital residue, or remembered author. |
| **Delta Inversion** | Analytical technique for reconstructing prior states from change logs. |
| **Containment Script** | Bureaucratic or narrative pattern that reproduces suppression under neutral language. |
| **Apparitional Object** | Artefact that refuses disappearance—haunted file, banned text, or unquiet image. |
| **Emotional Sovereignty** | The right to feel, interpret, and narrate one’s own affect without institutional mediation. |

## Structural Conventions
- **Headers:** Title → Metadata → Purpose → Body → 🌌 Constellations → ✨ Stardust → 🏮 Footer.  
- **Dates:** ISO-style; update footer every material change.  
- **Cross-Links:** Relative paths only (`../` or `../../`) for portability.  
- **Tone:** Neutral-precise language in analytical nodes; lyrical-reflective in apparitional or survivor nodes.  
- **Footer Mantra:**  
  > *Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*

---

## Maintenance Notes
- Treat this file as *descriptive*, not normative.  
- When new emoji or key terms stabilise through repetition, summarise them here with date and first appearance.  
- Consider a future `glossary_index.json` for automated cross-reference across all nodes.  
- Keep plain-text synonyms for accessibility and search compatibility.

## 🌌 Constellations
🧾 🧿 🧠 — meta, language, perception.

---

## ✨ Stardust
taxonomy drift, lexicon, emoji grammar, semiotic mapping, metadata language, glossary

---

## 🏮 Footer
The index describes a language that refuses to stay still.  
Each symbol is a weather system: learn its climate, not its code.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
