# 🛠️ Survivor Tools Index  
**First created:** 2025-08-17  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A living toolkit for those navigating suppression, harassment, or systemic obstruction.*

---

## Purpose
To gather, test, and share pragmatic instruments for surviving and outlasting containment systems.  
Every file here is written from lived experience, peer reviewed within community, and optimised for field use rather than theory.

This index points to the core tool families housed in `/Survivor_Tools/`.

---

## Tool Families
| Folder | Focus |
|---------|--------|
| **`grounding_and_regulation/`** | Somatic and cognitive techniques for restoring baseline after contact with hostile systems. |
| **`communication_sovereignty/`** | Clone-proof authorship methods, traceable documentation formats, and language discipline guides. |
| **`digital_safety/`** | Step-by-step guides for metadata hygiene, secure communications, and account protection. |
| **`peer_networks/`** | Templates for survivor circles, ally onboarding, and distributed mutual-care protocols. |
| **`evidence_preservation/`** | Checklists for logging interference, collecting screenshots, and maintaining chain of custody. |
| **`policy_intervention/`** | How to engage regulators, unions, or journalists without losing narrative control. |

## Using the Toolkit
1. **Start Small** – pick one tool and test it in your own environment.  
2. **Localise** – adapt templates to your jurisdiction or platform.  
3. **Document Outcomes** – log what works; feed back via `field_logs/`.  
4. **Encrypt Wisely** – keep originals off networked drives where possible.  
5. **Update Often** – digital safety advice ages faster than law.

## Companion Guides
Each sub-folder contains a `README.md` explaining:
- What the tool does  
- Required skill level  
- Time / resource estimate  
- Risk profile (low / moderate / high visibility)  
- Version history + checksum

---

## Tone & Ethos
- **Peer over paternal.** Tools are written by survivors, not for them.  
- **Minimum jargon.** Clarity is protection.  
- **Replicability first.** If it can’t be reused, it isn’t a tool yet.  
- **Respect fatigue.** Every instruction assumes low bandwidth and high stress.

## 🏮 Footer
This index is not a help-desk.  
It’s a workshop floor where survival is re-engineered every day.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
