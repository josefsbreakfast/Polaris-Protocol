# 📚 Research & Theory  
**First created:** 2025-08-17  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A living syllabus of critical, clinical, and cultural frameworks that shape the Polaris Protocol.*

---

## Purpose
To hold the intellectual and emotional lineages that inform Polaris: the writers, researchers, and survivors who have mapped suppression, recovery, and systemic reform before us.  
Each referenced text serves as both **evidence base** and **moral compass** — proof that theory is a survival technology.

---

## Thematic Clusters

### 🧠 Affective & Cultural Theory
Explores how ideology becomes atmosphere and containment becomes common sense.  
- **Mark Fisher** — *Capitalist Realism*, *Ghosts of My Life*, “good depression” as resistance.  
- **Lauren Berlant** — *Cruel Optimism*, affective infrastructures of survival.  
- **Byung-Chul Han** — *The Burnout Society*, *Psychopolitics*, transparency as control.  
- **Raymond Williams** — *Structures of Feeling*, pre-articulate experience under hegemony.  

---

### 💥 Trauma & Recovery
Grounding the protocol’s duty of care in empirical trauma literature and lived accounts.  
- **Bessel van der Kolk** — *The Body Keeps the Score* (somatic imprint).  
- **Stephanie Foo** — *What My Bones Know* (CPTSD narration).  
- **Judith Herman** — *Trauma and Recovery* (stages of recognition).  
- **ACE Index** and **VA Studies** — epidemiology of adverse experiences.  
- **Gabor Maté** — *The Myth of Normal*, trauma as systemic condition.  

---

### 🕵️ Surveillance, Behavioural Governance & Digital Economies
Where modern containment operates algorithmically.  
- **Shoshana Zuboff** — *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*.  
- **Virginia Eubanks** — *Automating Inequality*.  
- **Cathy O’Neil** — *Weapons of Math Destruction*.  
- **Ruha Benjamin** — *Race After Technology*, *Viral Justice*.  
- **Nick Couldry & Ulises Mejias** — *The Costs of Connection*.  

---

### 🌍 Diaspora, Displacement & Systemic Resilience
Understanding how collective memory and intergenerational trauma shape navigation under empire.  
- **Edward Said** — *Orientalism*, *Culture and Imperialism*.  
- **Stuart Hall** — identity, hybridity, cultural encoding/decoding.  
- **Paul Gilroy** — *The Black Atlantic*, counter-memory as freedom practice.  
- **Avtar Brah** — *Cartographies of Diaspora*.  
- **Saidiya Hartman** — *Lose Your Mother*, *Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments*.  

---

### 🔥 Abolitionist, Survivor-Led & Praxis Texts
Blueprints for reimagining institutions and restoring autonomy.  
- **Mariame Kaba** — *We Do This ’Til We Free Us*.  
- **Ruth Wilson Gilmore** — *Golden Gulag*, *Change Everything*.  
- **Angela Davis** — *Are Prisons Obsolete?*  
- **Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha** — *Care Work*.  
- **Eli Clare** — *Brilliant Imperfection*.  
- **Survivor-led field zines & collectives** — IRL and online abolitionist toolkits.  

---

## How to Use
- Treat this as a **map**, not a reading list — follow threads across disciplines.  
- Add marginalia: each reader’s annotation adds fidelity.  
- Pair every theoretical node with a *field* node — theory is incomplete without practice.  
- When citing, prioritise authors’ **own words** over secondary interpretation.  
- If a text feels heavy: step away, ground, then return. This is slow reading by design.

---

## Maintenance
- Add new works with short summaries and Polaris-relevant keywords.  
- Where possible, include DOI or stable archive links.  
- Note out-of-print or suppressed texts for acquisition tracking.  
- Cross-tag with `Constellations_Index.md` for network visualisation.

Every idea here was once a survival act.  
Read slowly, cite generously, carry forward.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
