# 💎 Resources  
**First created:** 2025-08-17  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A curated hub of reference materials, templates, and toolkits supporting the Polaris Protocol*

---

## Purpose
This folder anchors the **practical intelligence** of Polaris — the readings, templates, and self-defence infrastructures that turn theory into survivable practice.  
Each strand below connects research with action: together they form the reference field through which suppression becomes legible and counterable.

---

## Structure

### 1. 📚 Research & Theory  
*The thinking space.*  
Core texts and frameworks grounding Polaris in cultural theory, trauma studies, abolitionist thought, and survivor-led research.  
> *Read slowly. Annotate. Theory is a survival technology.*

---

### 2. 🛠️ Survivor Tools Index  
*The doing space.*  
Practical exercises and peer-built mechanisms for emotional regulation, communication sovereignty, and digital safety.  
> *Tools written by survivors, not for them.*

---

### 3. ⚖️ Legal Templates & Guides  
*The rights space.*  
Reusable boilerplates and procedural notes for asserting access, disclosure, and accommodation rights.  
> *Law made navigable under pressure.*

---

### 4. 🛰️ Forensic & OSINT Tools  
*The evidence space.*  
Digital and analogue methodologies for documenting harm, analysing metadata, and tracing suppression events.  
> *Integrity is the first defence.*

---

### 5. 🧾 Glossary & Meta Index  
*The language space.*  
Evolving lexicon of Polaris terminology, emoji conventions, and structural standards.  
> *Learn the grammar, not the rules.*

## How to Use
- Begin wherever you have energy — read, build, or repair.  
- Cross-reference between strands; every document links outward.  
- Keep local copies of templates before editing.  
- Respect redaction protocols when contributing new examples.  
- Treat this as a **living field manual**, not a static library.
