# ⚖️ Legal Templates & Guides  
**First created:** 2025-08-17  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A living archive of boilerplates, procedural notes, and plain-language guidance for asserting legal rights.*

---

## Purpose
To make law navigable under pressure.  
These templates convert complex statutory processes into reusable, editable tools for individuals and advocates confronting suppression, obstruction, or administrative delay.  
Everything here is drafted for **self-representation first**, professional counsel second.

## How to Use
1. **Copy, don’t edit originals.** Always duplicate a template before filling in details.  
2. **Annotate in plain language.** Replace placeholders `[like this]`; remove guidance notes before sending.  
3. **Preserve versions.** Keep timestamped copies of every submission and response.  
4. **Track correspondence.** Log emails and letters chronologically in a separate `case_log.md`.  
5. **Redact safely.** Use PDF editors or black-bar layers, not marker pens.
