## Why paper works  
- Out-of-band provenance.  
- Independent timeline corroboration.  
- Psychological clarity for testimony.  

---

## Practices  
- Neutral factual entries (date/time).  
- Secure storage; minimal sensitive data.  
- Hash scans if needed.  
- Use as supplement, not sole record.
