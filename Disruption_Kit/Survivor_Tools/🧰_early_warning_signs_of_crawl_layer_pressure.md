## 🛰️ Orientation  

This Survivor Tool supports individuals and small groups who rely on search visibility but **do not control server infrastructure** and **do not work primarily in technical SEO**.

It provides a grounded way to notice when visibility problems may stem from **crawl-layer or indexing pressure**, rather than ordinary SEO volatility, content quality, or personal incompetence.

This is a **diagnostic aid**, not an accusation framework.  
Most SEO problems are mundane. This tool exists to help you tell when something *isn’t*.

## 🧭 Ground Rule (Read First)  

- One signal means nothing  
- Two signals mean “pay attention”  
- **Patterns over time** are what matter  

If using this checklist increases anxiety, rumination, or urgency to “fix everything”, **stop**.  
The purpose is steadiness, not vigilance theatre.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- No server or log access required  
- No attribution assumptions  
- No escalation by default  
- Focus on persistence and asymmetry, not single events  

---

## 🧿 Early Warning Signals  

### 1. Disproportionate Crawl Attention to Low-Value Pages  

Notice if:
- Old, thin, or irrelevant pages suddenly appear indexed
- Parameterised or junk URLs surface in Search Console
- Search results favour pages you would not promote

⚠️ Only relevant if this **persists**, not if it appears briefly.

---

### 2. Indexing Volatility Without Content Change  

Pay attention when:
- Pages drop and reappear without edits
- Canonicals are intermittently ignored
- “Discovered — currently not indexed” cycles repeatedly

If publishing cadence and internal linking are stable, this deserves a second look.

---

### 3. Performance Signals That Don’t Match Lived Experience  

Examples:
- Search tools report slowness users do not experience
- Mobile warnings appear without design changes
- Crawled pages time out while browsers load normally

This suggests crawler-specific stress rather than user-facing failure.

---

### 4. Fragmentation of Narrative Pages  

Watch for:
- Supporting or peripheral pages ranking while core explainers disappear
- Old drafts outranking updated statements
- Context pages losing visibility while excerpts persist

This is **narrative dilution**, not simple reach loss.

---

### 5. Standard SEO Fixes Stop Working  

Be cautious if:
- Best-practice changes help briefly, then collapse
- Each “fix” produces diminishing returns
- You’re advised to keep tuning without diagnosis

This is a common exhaustion loop.

---

### 6. Uneven Impact Across Similar Content  

Compare:
- Near-identical pages behaving very differently
- One topic area destabilised while others remain stable
- Archives resurfacing while new work stalls

Asymmetry matters more than decline.

---

## 🧠 How to Interpret What You See  

Ask grounding questions:

- Is this **persistent** or episodic?  
- Is the issue **structural** (crawl/index) or **editorial** (content)?  
- Is the effect **diffuse** or **concentrated**?  

Avoid asking *“who would do this?”*  
That question comes later — if at all.

---

## 🛑 When *Not* to Escalate  

Do **not** escalate if:
- Changes align with known search updates
- Issues resolve within weeks
- Problems follow redesigns or migrations
- Only one signal appears in isolation

Most SEO disruption is not interference.

---

## 🧩 What *Is* in Your Control  

Low-cost stabilisers:
- Strengthen internal links to core pages
- Reduce URL sprawl where possible
- Clarify canonical intent
- Pause reactive optimisation cycles
- Document changes instead of chasing them

Stability is protective.

---

## 🌱 Psychological Safety Note  

Ambiguous technical failure often triggers:
- Self-blame  
- Over-optimisation  
- Loss of confidence  
- Internal group friction  

If this tool begins to feel consuming, **step back**.  
Your work matters more than any dashboard.
