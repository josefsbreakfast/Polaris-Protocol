# 🫥 Presumption as Erasure 
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-09  
*How assumptions of privilege erase Jewish survivor testimony and material need.*  

---

## ✨ Context  

- Jewish survivors often face **assumptions of wealth, networks, or resilience**.  
- These presumptions function as erasure: “you don’t need support, you’re covered.”  

---

## Notes (to expand)  

- Presumption of privilege → denial of need.  
- Presumption of resilience → dismissal of vulnerability.  
- Presumption of displacement → antisemitism framed as “elsewhere,” not here.

*Presumption as Erasure* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
