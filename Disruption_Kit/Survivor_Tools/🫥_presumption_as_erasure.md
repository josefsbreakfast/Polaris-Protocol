# 🫥 Presumption as Erasure  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*How assumptions of privilege erase Jewish survivor testimony and material need.*

## ✨ Context  

Within many humanitarian and solidarity spaces, Jewish survivors encounter a paradox:  
they are **seen as powerful**, even when impoverished, isolated, or under siege.  

This presumption — of access, wealth, or automatic resilience — **acts as an erasure mechanism**.  
It writes over lived need, blocks support, and reframes vulnerability as entitlement.  

The result is a **containment of grief, anger, and testimony** through politeness and projection.

## 🧿 Mechanisms of Erasure  

| Presumption | Erasure Effect | Institutional Translation |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Wealth or connection** | Need denied: “you’ll manage” | Funding diverted, emergency aid refused, social service gatekeeping |
| **Resilience or intellect** | Pain dismissed: “you’re strong” | Therapy or safeguarding support deprioritised |
| **Cultural literacy** | Harm reframed as misunderstanding | Antisemitism minimised, gaslighting under “education” |
| **Diaspora displacement** | Antisemitism framed as elsewhere | Domestic accountability dodged through global whataboutism |

## 🕍 Containment via Gatekeeping  

Presumption is rarely abstract — it becomes architecture.  
During moments of collective grief or political escalation, **community space itself** becomes a weaponisable boundary.  

Many spaces that claim to offer solidarity — synagogues, cultural hubs, academic circles, interfaith networks, or online support groups —  
are structured around **geographical, denominational, or political filters** that can be quietly weaponised.  

- **Geography as gate:** “You’re not *from here*.” Local membership or postcode checks used to screen out displaced, isolated, or unaligned survivors.  
- **Legibility as leverage:** Requests for “proof of belonging” or “authorised identity” become means of excluding those already disoriented by suppression.  
- **Leadership nudges:** Community figures are **nudged to distrust** or distance themselves from those seeking help — framed as “security concern,” “agitator,” or “outside influence.”  
- **Containment by comfort:** Spaces of worship, mourning, or debate are curated for the comfort of donors or majority politics, not for survivor safety.  

In the current escalation of the **Palestinian genocide**, this mechanism has become acute:  
Jewish survivors opposing genocide, or simply showing distress at its witnessing,  
are subtly contained through whispers of disloyalty or extremism.  
What begins as **“just community caution”** becomes a coded exclusion that blocks mutual aid and isolates dissenters.  

Containment thrives on this overlap between **presumed privilege and weaponised propriety** —  
a system where safety discourse masks abandonment, and gatekeeping becomes a social firewall against empathy.

## 🍋🌾 Environmental Containment  

Attempts to reach unaffiliated or grassroots community spaces often meet **material friction**: transport failures, sudden diversions, inexplicable delays.  
These patterns mirror **crowd-control logic** — soft containment framed as coincidence.  

- **Transit drift:** Trains cancelled, buses rerouted, rideshare apps looping or timing out near meeting points.  
- **Infrastructure excuse:** “Signal failure,” “police incident,” “technical fault” — repeated just enough to normalise avoidance.  
- **Behavioural steering:** Repetition teaches fatigue; over time, survivors self-limit travel to “approved” or institutional venues.  

During 2024–2025 escalations in **Birmingham** and **Manchester**, several survivors described this as **ambient crowd control** —  
not overt policing but a logistical narrowing of movement that echoes protest containment tactics.  
The effect is psychological as well as physical: it makes isolation feel self-chosen,  
turning distance into discipline.

### 🎟️ Field Note — Attempting Community Travel  

> “In recent months, when I’ve travelled to **Birmingham** or **Manchester**,  
> my phone maps will suddenly redirect me or show strange nudges.  
> On foot, several people in a row will look at their phone, veer into me, or block my path.  
> This happens most when I’ve booked to go to **London** for Jewish community events or festival days.  
> Over time it begins to feel like my ability to make community with other Jewish people is being actively denied —  
> not just by institutional filters but through constant, low-level interference in my movement.”  

This personal observation sits within the wider pattern of environmental containment:  
it documents the sensory and behavioural texture of suppression that official language erases.

## 🕯️ Post-Holocaust Anxiety as Containment Substrate  

Beneath all of this lies a **background stress hum** — the post-Holocaust vigilance that lives inside Jewish nervous systems and community structures.  
It is both a survival mechanism and a vulnerability.  

Politicians, media figures, and institutional actors **weaponise this baseline anxiety**:  
by invoking danger, purity, or betrayal, they can steer collective behaviour without overt coercion.  

- **Fear as loyalty test:** “Support this policy, or you’re endangering Jews.”  
- **Security as obedience:** Expanding surveillance and silencing dissent becomes framed as safety.  
- **Solidarity inversion:** Grief for Palestinians or critique of state violence is recoded as self-hatred.  

This post-Holocaust anxiety is constantly mined — not just referenced.  
It fuels cycles of over-compliance, communal suspicion, and the quiet self-policing of empathy.  
When survivors or descendants feel their safety and belonging are conditional, containment no longer needs fences; it’s internalised.

## 🧩 Internalised Colour and Proximity Logic  

Jewish experience is not monolithic.  
While many **Ashkenazi Jews are white or white-passing**, the UK and the global Jewish community includes **Black Jews, Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews, Arab Jews, and Jews of mixed heritage**.  
These realities rarely appear in UK communal life, where whiteness is often treated as default and difference as anomaly.  

This narrow image produces a distorted mirror:  
- **Philo-semitism as disguise for racism.**  Admiration replaces understanding, masking hostility beneath politeness.  
- **Internalised white supremacy.**  Centuries of conditional safety inside European whiteness trained many Jews to seek acceptance through proximity to power, not solidarity.  
- **Reciprocal exclusion.**  Fear of rejection turns outward, pushing away communities of colour even as those communities are pushed away from us.  

The result is not a clean double edge but a **spiky feedback loop** — fear and defensiveness reinforcing the same isolation we wish to escape.  
To build resilience, Jewish spaces must confront both external containment and the internal hierarchies that mirror it.  
True safety will come from **coalition, not compliance**.

*Presumption as Erasure* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how presumptions of privilege, communal gatekeeping, and inherited vigilance erase Jewish survivor testimony, obstruct solidarity, and recode harm as self-sufficiency.
