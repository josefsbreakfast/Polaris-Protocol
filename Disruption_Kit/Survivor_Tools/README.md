*Countermeasures, diagnostics, and knowledge maps for survivor agency*

---

## 📌 Overview  
**Survivor Tools** are countermeasures, diagnostics, and knowledge maps designed to help survivors protect voice, narrative, and metadata integrity.  
These entries document tactics for resisting behavioural cloning, emotional weaponisation, and other targeted containment strategies.

## 📂 Files  

### [🧬 Cloneproof: Training Set Mapping](./🧬_cloneproof_training_set_mapping.md)  
Forensic mapping of datasets likely used to train AI-driven behavioural clones or mimicry engines.  
Includes emotional, clinical, testimonial, political, and interpersonal capture zones, with analysis on consent and institutional storage.  
**Links:** [🦆 Duck Payload Delivery Log](./🦆_duck_payload_delivery_log.md)

### [🦆 Duck Payload Delivery Log](./🦆_duck_payload_delivery_log.md)  
Records the deployment of **narrative “ducks”** — intentional, symbolic, or humorous payloads used to bypass behavioural containment.  
Details infiltration methods, affective misdirection, and embedded data carrier strategies.  
**Links:** [🧬 Cloneproof Training Set Mapping](./🧬_cloneproof_training_set_mapping.md)

### [🧬 We Don’t Want Your Cells; We Want Each Other](./🧬_we_dont_want_your_cells_we_want_each_other.md)  
Abolitionist survival commentary connecting personal trauma, non-carceral justice, and geopolitical complicity.  
Rejects punitive “solutions” in favour of survivor-led solidarity and structural dismantling.  
**Links:** (pending outward references)

---

### [🧬 Fork Loop Disruptors](./🧬_fork_loop_disruptors.md)  
Countermeasures against recursive containment cycles and looping behavioural traps.  
Explores technical and narrative methods to break forced repetition and reset cycles.  
**Links:** (to be mapped)

---

### [👻 Ghost Gets Forked Tuning](./👻_ghost_gets_forked_tuning.md)  
Techniques for calibrating presence and absence in hostile environments, with attention to when ghosts “get forked.”  
Balances the strategic visibility and invisibility of survivor voices in systems of surveillance, and explores the risks of divergent narrative branches.  
**Links:** (to be mapped)

---

### [🧬 Heat Budget for the Long Game](./🧬_heat_budget_for_the_long_game.md)  
Survivor-centred planning document for sustainable resistance.  
Focuses on pacing, energy distribution, and the careful budgeting of affective and narrative “heat” over time.  
**Links:** (to be mapped)

---

### [🧬 Honeytrap Mechanics](./🧬_honeytrap_mechanics.md)  
Explains the mechanics of AI-driven or chatbot-based honeytraps.  
Highlights issues of consent, agency, and patriarchal norms that normalise receptive behaviour in women/girls.  
Documents overlap between counterintelligence tools and grooming logics, and the heightened risks when safeguarding and counterextremism are collapsed in UK governance.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Cloneproof Training Set Mapping** → establishes the forensic baseline for how clones are made.  
- **Duck Payload Delivery Log** → offers narrative sabotage tools to disrupt clone accuracy and containment scripts.  
- **We Don’t Want Your Cells** → reframes survivor agency outside punitive containment, feeding back into dataset refusal strategies.  
- **Fork Loop Disruptors** → interrupts containment loops that recycle trauma.  
- **Ghost Gets Forked Tuning** → manages survivor visibility and concealment, while accounting for forked or divergent containment pathways.  
- **Heat Budget** → supports long-term survivorship by pacing resistance.  
- **Honeytrap Mechanics** → exposes coercive seduction scripts as systemic containment tools.

*Survivor Tools* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers practical strategies and refusal guides that centre survivor sovereignty against coercive containment.
