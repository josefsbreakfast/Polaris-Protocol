# 🧬 Survivor Tools  

**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-09  

*Countermeasures, diagnostics, and knowledge maps for survivor agency.*  

---

## 📌 Overview  
**Survivor Tools** are countermeasures, diagnostics, and knowledge maps designed to help survivors protect voice, narrative, and metadata integrity.  
These entries document tactics for resisting behavioural cloning, emotional weaponisation, antisemitic erasure, and other targeted containment strategies.

## 📂 Files  

### 🔬 AI & Containment Tech  

- [🧬 Cloneproof: Training Set Mapping](./🧬_cloneproof_training_set_mapping.md)  
  Forensic mapping of datasets likely used to train AI-driven behavioural clones or mimicry engines.  
  **Links:** [🦆 Duck Payload Delivery Log](./🦆_duck_payload_delivery_log.md)  

- [🦆 Duck Payload Delivery Log](./🦆_duck_payload_delivery_log.md)  
  Records the deployment of narrative “ducks” — intentional, symbolic, or humorous payloads used to bypass containment.  
  **Links:** [🧬 Cloneproof Training Set Mapping](./🧬_cloneproof_training_set_mapping.md)  

- [🧬 Fork Loop Disruptors](./🧬_fork_loop_disruptors.md)  
  Countermeasures against recursive containment cycles and looping behavioural traps.  

- [👻 Ghost Gets Forked Tuning](./👻_ghost_gets_forked_tuning.md)  
  Techniques for calibrating presence and absence in hostile environments, balancing visibility and invisibility.  

- [🧬 Heat Budget for the Long Game](./🧬_heat_budget_for_the_long_game.md)  
  Survivor-centred planning for sustainable resistance. Focuses on pacing and energy distribution.  

- [🧬 Honeytrap Mechanics](./🧬_honeytrap_mechanics.md)  
  Explains AI-driven or chatbot-based honeytraps. Documents overlaps with grooming and counterintelligence.

### 🕎 Social & Cultural Erasure  

- [🕎 Exile Logic and Dual Coding](./🕎_exile_logic_dual_coding.md)  
  Examines the logic of exile — how Jewish survivors are framed as always “elsewhere.”  
  **Links:** [🫥 Presumption as Erasure](./🫥_presumption_as_erasure.md)  

- [🌐 Hollowing of the Commons](./🌐_hollowing_of_the_commons.md)  
  Tracks how collective spaces are stripped of memory and solidarity through privatisation and containment logic.  

- [🫥 Presumption as Erasure](./🫥_presumption_as_erasure.md)  
  Documents how assumptions of privilege erase Jewish survivor testimony and material need.

### 🌱 Abolition & Justice Refusal  

- [🧬 We Don’t Want Your Cells; We Want Each Other](./🧬_we_dont_want_your_cells_we_want_each_other.md)  
  Abolitionist survival commentary connecting trauma, non-carceral justice, and geopolitical complicity.  
  Rejects punitive “solutions” in favour of survivor-led solidarity and structural dismantling.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  

### 🔬 AI & Containment Tech  
- **Cloneproof Training Set Mapping** → establishes the forensic baseline for how clones are made.  
- **Duck Payload Delivery Log** → offers narrative sabotage tools to disrupt clone accuracy and containment scripts.  
- **Fork Loop Disruptors** → interrupts containment loops that recycle trauma.  
- **Ghost Gets Forked Tuning** → manages survivor visibility and concealment, while accounting for forked or divergent containment pathways.  
- **Heat Budget for the Long Game** → supports long-term survivorship by pacing resistance.  
- **Honeytrap Mechanics** → exposes coercive seduction scripts as systemic containment tools.  

Together, these entries chart the **technical battlefield** of behavioural containment and digital manipulation, giving survivors tactics to resist systemic cloning and capture.  

---

### 🕎 Social & Cultural Erasure  
- **Exile Logic and Dual Coding** → maps antisemitic containment logics that frame survivors as perpetually displaced.  
- **Presumption as Erasure** → shows how privilege assumptions silence survivor testimony and block solidarity.  
- **Hollowing of the Commons** → connects erasure at the survivor level to systemic destruction of collective spaces.  

These nodes work in constellation, showing how silence is normalised socially and culturally, and how erasure is embedded in both everyday presumptions and structural shifts.  

---

### 🌱 Abolition & Justice Refusal  
- **We Don’t Want Your Cells; We Want Each Other** → reframes survivor agency outside carceral containment, feeding back into dataset refusal and solidarity-building.  

This thread insists on **justice without cages**, linking personal survival with structural refusal of punitive containment.

## 🎞️ Constellation: Social & Cultural Erasure  

- **Books**  
  - *The Book of Laughter and Forgetting* (Milan Kundera) — memory erased by decree, and forgetting politicised.  
  - *Caliban and the Witch* (Silvia Federici) — the enclosure of the commons as a gendered and economic erasure.  
  - *The Dispossessed* (Ursula K. Le Guin) — presumption of scarcity and exile shaping whole social orders.  

- **Films**  
  - *The Lives of Others* — surveillance and suppression woven into everyday cultural life.  
  - *Spotlight* — media complicity in silence and the painstaking work of breaking it.  
  - *Sorry We Missed You* (Ken Loach) — economic grind as erasure of dignity, memory, and community.  

- **Music**  
  - *Terraform: The Possibility* (Propaganda) — resistance as vision, sound as blueprint.  
  - *Cleopatra* (Efendi) — defiant anthem against silencing, reframing survival as glory.  
  - *Millennial Bundist* (Isobel Frey) — Bundist legacy carried forward in millennial voice.  

- **Cultural Threads**  
  - The way Jewish survivors are presumed “resilient” or “wealthy,” erasing actual need.  
  - Economic grind confining memory to “essential tasks” — food, laundry, household survival.  
  - The hollowing of commons: privatised public space where solidarity and memory networks are dismantled.

*Survivor Tools* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers practical strategies and refusal guides that centre survivor sovereignty against coercive containment.
