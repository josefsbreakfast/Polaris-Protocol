## 📌 Overview  
**Survivor Tools** are countermeasures, diagnostics, and knowledge maps designed to help survivors protect voice, narrative, and metadata integrity.  
These entries document tactics for resisting behavioural cloning, emotional weaponisation, and other targeted containment strategies.

## 📂 Files  

### [`🧬 Cloneproof: Training Set Mapping`](./🧬_cloneproof_training_set_mapping.md)  
Forensic mapping of datasets likely used to train AI-driven behavioural clones or mimicry engines.  
Includes emotional, clinical, testimonial, political, and interpersonal capture zones, with analysis on consent and institutional storage.

### [`🦆 Duck Payload Delivery Log`](./🦆_duck_payload_delivery_log.md)  
Records the deployment of **narrative “ducks”** — intentional, symbolic, or humorous payloads used to bypass behavioural containment.  
Details infiltration methods, affective misdirection, and embedded data carrier strategies.

### [`🧬 We Don't Want Your Cells; We Want Each Other`](./🧬_we_dont_want_your_cells_we_want_each_other.md)  
Abolitionist survival commentary connecting personal trauma, non-carceral justice, and geopolitical complicity.  
Rejects punitive “solutions” in favour of survivor-led solidarity and structural dismantling.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Cloneproof Training Set Mapping** → establishes the forensic baseline for how clones are made.  
- **Duck Payload Delivery Log** → offers narrative sabotage tools to disrupt clone accuracy and containment scripts.  
- **We Don’t Want Your Cells** → reframes survivor agency outside punitive containment, feeding back into dataset refusal strategies.
