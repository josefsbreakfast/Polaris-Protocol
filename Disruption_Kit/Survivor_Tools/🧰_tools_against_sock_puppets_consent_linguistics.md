# 🧰 Toolset Add-On: Permission Language Pack  
**First created:** 2025-12-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-23  
*Phrases that allow people to act without ideological alignment.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
People often stay silent not because they disagree —  
but because they don’t know *how* to speak safely.

These phrases lower that barrier.

---

## 🫀 Core permission phrases  

Use these verbatim or adapt lightly:

- “You don’t have to support the protest to support keeping people alive.”
- “Whatever your politics, no one should die.”
- “This is about preventing harm, not endorsing tactics.”
- “Covering hunger strikes is not endorsement — it’s public interest.”
- “We can disagree and still draw a line at death.”

---

## 🧠 Why these work  
They:
- remove ideological pressure,
- reassure moderates and conservatives,
- block polarisation,
- and make empathy legible.

They are **coalition-safe language**.

---

## 🗣️ When to use them  
- In posts where comments feel hostile  
- In group chats where people are hesitant  
- In conversations with older relatives  
- In emails to institutions  
- In media interviews  

---

## ⚠️ What to avoid pairing them with  
- accusations,
- sarcasm,
- moral grandstanding,
- “if you don’t agree, you’re complicit” framing.

Permission collapses if it feels like a trap.
