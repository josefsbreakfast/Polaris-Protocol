# 🗞️ Hollowing of the Commons

*Why conditional belonging and fear of harassment produce silence in public space.*  

---

## ✨ Context  

- Many “normal” or supportive voices avoid public engagement.  
- Silence becomes survival strategy: commenting = liability.  
- This creates the illusion that only adversarial voices exist.  

---

## Notes (to expand)  

- Commons are not empty, but **hollowed out**.  
- Survivor testimony feels isolated because balancing voices stay invisible.  
- Conditional belonging (when white / when not white) intensifies withdrawal.
