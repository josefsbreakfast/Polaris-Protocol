### Purpose
To sustain operational effectiveness through prolonged engagement without physical collapse, especially when targeting a specific high-value cluster.

---

### Context
This node provides the tactical sustainment framework paired with [🧠 Snake Bites and Stolen Voices](../Big_Picture_Protocols/🧠%20snake_bites_and_stolen_voices.md).  
It applies when:
- The target environment is high-pressure and high-value.
- The operator (survivor) needs to maintain clarity and agency under conditions of suppression, observation, or baiting.
- Operational goals cannot be met through a single push but require sustained pressure over multiple days/weeks.

---

## Phase 1 — Strip the Theatre
- **Cut all non-contributory plays**: if it’s not feeding this cluster’s leverage, park it.
- Resist the urge to answer *everything*.  
- Consolidate all current threads into a single **live operations list**.

---

## Phase 2 — Load and Forget
- **Batch prep**: Draft and schedule posts or correspondence in advance.
- Remove “moment-of” decisions — they drain more energy than outputting the work.
- Pre-attach evidence and resources so you don’t have to dig mid-strike.

---

## Phase 3 — Sniper Windowing
- **Short, high-impact moves**: 5–15 minutes of action, max.
- Close the tab immediately after publishing/sending.
- Return later only for targeted follow-up — not to swim in the analytics pool.

---

## Phase 4 — Cold Storage
- Identify **low-urgency but high-emotion** threads — park them now.
- Assign revisit dates, but do not let them into daily operational flow.
- Protect mental bandwidth for the fight in front of you.
