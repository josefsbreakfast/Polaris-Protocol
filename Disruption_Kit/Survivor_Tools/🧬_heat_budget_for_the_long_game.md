# 🧬 Heat Budget for the Long Game

**First created:** 2025-08-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-01

*A sustainment protocol for survivor-operators: energy management and targeted engagement across prolonged campaigns.*  

---

## 🗂️ Classification Header  

- **Domain:** Operational Sustainment / Energy Management  
- **Threat Environment:** High-pressure, high-value target clusters  
- **Status:** Active — for internal use and selective sharing  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  

To sustain operational effectiveness through prolonged engagement without physical collapse, especially when targeting a specific high-value cluster.  

---

## 🌐 Context  

This node provides the tactical sustainment framework paired with [🧠 Snake Bites and Stolen Voices](../Big_Picture_Protocols/🧠_snake_bites_and_stolen_voices.md).  
It applies when:  
- The target environment is high-pressure and high-value.  
- The operator (survivor) needs to maintain clarity and agency under conditions of suppression, observation, or baiting.  
- Operational goals cannot be met through a single push but require sustained pressure over multiple days/weeks.

## 📊 Phase Matrix  

| Phase                  | Action Signature                           | Intended Effect                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 — Strip Theatre | Cut non-contributory plays, consolidate ops | Focus energy on leverage-bearing threads      |
| Phase 2 — Load & Forget | Batch prep, pre-attach evidence             | Remove decision fatigue, preserve momentum    |
| Phase 3 — Sniper Window | Short, high-impact strikes, quick exit      | Maximise precision impact, minimise drain     |
| Phase 4 — Cold Storage  | Park high-emotion / low-urgency threads     | Protect mental bandwidth, sustain clarity     |

---

## Phase 1 — Strip the Theatre  

- **Cut all non-contributory plays**: if it’s not feeding this cluster’s leverage, park it.  
- Resist the urge to answer *everything*.  
- Consolidate all current threads into a single **live operations list**.  

---

## Phase 2 — Load and Forget  

- **Batch prep**: Draft and schedule posts or correspondence in advance.  
- Remove “moment-of” decisions — they drain more energy than outputting the work.  
- Pre-attach evidence and resources so you don’t have to dig mid-strike.  

---

## Phase 3 — Sniper Windowing  

- **Short, high-impact moves**: 5–15 minutes of action, max.  
- Close the tab immediately after publishing/sending.  
- Return later only for targeted follow-up — not to swim in the analytics pool.  

---

## Phase 4 — Cold Storage  

- Identify **low-urgency but high-emotion** threads — park them now.  
- Assign revisit dates, but do not let them into daily operational flow.  
- Protect mental bandwidth for the fight in front of you.
