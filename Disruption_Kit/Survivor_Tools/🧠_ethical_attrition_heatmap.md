# 🧠 Ethical Attrition Heatmap  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-13  
*A diagnostic tool for reading workforce exits as institutional signal rather than neutral turnover.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Attrition is often treated as background noise:  
people leave jobs; organisations adapt.

In coercive institutions under stress, this framing is dangerously incomplete.

This tool reframes departures as **data** — showing where ethical strain concentrates, where institutional memory drains, and where authoritarian drift becomes self-sustaining.

The question is not simply *how many* leave, but:
> **who leaves, from where, and why.**

---

## 🧠 What This Heatmap Tracks  

The Ethical Attrition Heatmap focuses on four intersecting dimensions:

1. **Who is leaving**  
2. **Which roles and teams are affected**  
3. **At what career stage exits cluster**  
4. **What forms of knowledge and judgment are lost**

Used together, these reveal whether attrition is **random** or **patterned**.

---

## 🔎 Dimension 1: Who Leaves  

Pay attention to whether exits disproportionately involve:
- officers with strong ethical reputations,
- community-facing or de-escalation specialists,
- internal critics or reform advocates,
- individuals from marginalised backgrounds,
- those carrying informal mentoring or moral labour.

**Signal:**  
Ethical capacity is exiting faster than coercive capacity.

---

## 🔎 Dimension 2: Where Attrition Clusters  

Identify teams or functions with elevated exit rates, especially:
- community policing units,
- safeguarding and vulnerability teams,
- oversight-adjacent or liaison roles,
- units handling politically sensitive work.

Attrition clustering matters more than overall numbers.

**Signal:**  
The system is shedding precisely the roles that provide restraint and relational intelligence.

---

## 🔎 Dimension 3: Career-Stage Patterns  

Watch for exits that cluster:
- just before promotion,
- after whistleblowing or internal conflict,
- following high-profile incidents,
- during mid-career (not early churn, not retirement).

Mid-career exits are particularly diagnostic:
they represent **loss of trained judgment**, not failed recruitment.

---

## 🔎 Dimension 4: Loss of Institutional Memory  

Beyond headcount, assess what knowledge leaves with people:
- local community relationships,
- informal risk knowledge,
- historical case context,
- understanding of “how things really work”.

This loss is often invisible on spreadsheets but devastating in practice.

**Signal:**  
The organisation becomes procedurally intact but cognitively hollow.

---

## 🧠 Attrition as Signal, Not Turnover  

Healthy organisations experience turnover that is:
- distributed,
- role-balanced,
- and knowledge-replenished.

Ethical attrition looks different:
- departures are clustered,
- replacements are less experienced or more rigid,
- remaining staff carry unsustainable moral load.

When ethical attrition is misread as normal turnover, institutions miss their **last early warning**.

---

## 🚨 How to Use This Tool  

- Compare exit patterns over time, not snapshots.  
- Cross-reference attrition with:
  - disciplinary data,
  - complaint spikes,
  - policy changes,
  - public controversy.
- Treat exit interviews as **evidence**, not HR formalities.

Silence is also data.
