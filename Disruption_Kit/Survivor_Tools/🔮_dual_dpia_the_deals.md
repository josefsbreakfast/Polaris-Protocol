# 🔮 Dual DPIA the Deals  
**First created:** 2026-01-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*A method for testing whether data protection compliance exists in substance rather than theatre, by lawfully requesting DPIA-related material from both data controllers and data processors involved in the same processing activity.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation

When analytics, behavioural insight, or security-adjacent vendors operate under government contracts, accountability often fragments across institutions.  
The **Dual DPIA** method restores clarity by running **parallel, lawful requests** that force role discipline, timeline integrity, and scope honesty.

This node documents:
- why the method works,
- how to apply it systematically,
- how to reuse it across contracts,
- and how to read the results without over-technical framing.

---

## 🧩 Core Principle

> **You do not DPIA organisations.  
> You DPIA processing.  
> And you can lawfully ask everyone involved what they hold.**

- DPIA obligation → **Data Controller**  
- DPIA assistance & materials → **Data Processor**  
- Scrutiny right → **Public / Data Subject**

Parallel requests are not duplication; they are **cross-validation**.

---

## 🧠 Why “Dual DPIA” Works

### 1. It forces role clarity  
Controllers must state whether:
- a DPIA exists,
- they authored or approved it,
- they relied on vendor material.

Processors must state whether:
- they supplied DPIA templates,
- they conducted risk analysis,
- they were instructed on scope and use.

Any mismatch is evidentiary.

---

### 2. It exposes timeline integrity  
Common failure modes revealed:
- DPIAs dated *after* deployment  
- vendor risk documents predating procurement  
- “updated” DPIAs without version history  

Compliance that only exists retroactively collapses under daylight.

---

### 3. It surfaces scope drift  
Controllers often describe:
- narrow use cases  
- advisory-only outputs  

Vendors often describe:
- broader system capability  
- reuse across clients  
- inference-rich features  

That delta is where unlawful processing hides.

## 🛠️ Systematic Use (Repeatable Method)

### Phase 1: Contract Mapping
For each vendor:
- list departments / authorities  
- list stated purposes  
- note affected populations  

You are mapping **processing contexts**, not organisations.

---

### Phase 2: Controller FOI (Governance Layer)

**Request focus:**
- DPIAs relating to the deployment or use of the vendor/system  
- risk registers, ethics approvals, sign-off records  
- procurement documents referencing data protection, profiling, or inference  

**Key technique:**  
Always ask for *existence, dates, authors, and titles* even if content may be exempt.

---

### Phase 3: Controller SAR (Reality Layer, if applicable)

If you plausibly fall within scope:
- request personal data  
- inferred or derived attributes  
- profiles, flags, risk indicators  
- metadata relating to decision-making  

This tests whether DPIA claims match lived processing.

---

### Phase 4: Processor Request (Mirror Channel)

Depending on jurisdiction and status:
- SAR to the vendor (for your data)  
- transparency request asking what DPIA or risk materials they supplied  
- request for system documentation describing risks and mitigations  

You are not asking them to *own* the DPIA—only to describe their contribution.

---

### Phase 5: Comparison Pass

You are looking for:
- contradictions  
- omissions  
- scope mismatches  
- timeline inconsistencies  

Patterns across **multiple contracts** matter more than any single failure.

---

## 📊 Comparison Grid Template  
*(Controller vs Processor vs SAR)*

| Dimension | Controller (FOI) | Processor (Vendor) | SAR (Reality Check) |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| DPIA existence | Claimed / denied | Template supplied? | Referenced indirectly? |
| Date & version | Pre- or post-deployment | Draft / undated | Reflected in data timing |
| Scope of processing | Narrow / advisory | Broad / capability-based | Actual use evident |
| Profiling / inference | Denied / minimised | Described functionally | Present in outputs |
| Special category data | “Not processed” | Proxy-based features | Inferred attributes |
| Human review | Policy-level | Tool-level | Evidence of intervention |
| Retention & sharing | Policy stated | System defaults | Downstream traces |

Use inconsistencies as **questions**, not accusations.

## 🚩 DPIA Red-Flag Lexicon  
*Language that reliably signals weakness or theatre*

- “No high risk identified” (without explanation)
- “The supplier conducted the DPIA”
- “Advisory only” (while influencing decisions)
- “No automated decision-making” (but profiling exists)
- “Data is anonymised” (where re-identification is plausible)
- “Industry standard safeguards”
- “Reviewed internally” (no named role or date)
- “Updated DPIA” (no version history)
- “Out of scope” (for inference or derived data)

One flag is noise.  
Repeated flags across contracts are pattern evidence.

## 📰 Journalist-Facing Explainer  
*(Plain language, no GDPR jargon)*

**What’s going on here?**  
Governments increasingly use analytics companies to help them understand people, risks, or behaviour. These systems often rely on inference rather than direct evidence.

**What’s a DPIA?**  
A Data Protection Impact Assessment is meant to show that risks to people were identified *before* a system was used—and that someone took responsibility for those risks.

**Why ask both sides?**  
The government says how it thinks the system is used.  
The company says what the system can actually do.  
Your data shows what happens in reality.

When those three stories don’t match, that’s the story.

**Why does this matter?**  
Because profiling errors, stereotypes, and weak governance don’t show up as scandals right away—they show up as quiet harms spread across many people.

**Is this a loophole?**  
No. It’s how transparency law is meant to work.

## 📄 Templates (Neutral, Reusable)

### Template A: Controller FOI – DPIA Existence & Scope

> Please provide copies of any Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), risk assessments, or equivalent documents relating to the processing of personal data in connection with [system/vendor], including documents that assess profiling, inference, or behavioural analysis.  
>  
> If disclosure of full content is exempt, please confirm the existence, dates, authors, titles, and scope of such documents.

---

### Template B: Processor Transparency Request (Non-Statutory)

> Please confirm whether you supplied any DPIA templates, risk assessments, or data protection analysis to [public authority] in relation to your services, and if so, the nature and date of those materials.  
>  
> This request does not seek disclosure of confidential client information, only clarification of your role in DPIA-related work.

---

### Template C: SAR – Inferred / Derived Data

> Please provide all personal data relating to me, including any inferred, derived, or predicted attributes, profiles, risk indicators, or segmentation labels, whether generated directly or via analytic or behavioural models, and any metadata relating to their use or sharing.

## ⚖️ What This Is *Not*

- Not evasion  
- Not system manipulation  
- Not harassment  
- Not “gotcha” tactics  

It is **procedural verification** using the law as written.

---

## 🧷 Reuse Notes

- Works best when applied **across multiple departments**  
- Strongest when paired with timeline comparison  
- Safe to run slowly and methodically  
- Produces documentary artefacts suitable for journalism, regulation, or litigation  

---

## 🧭 Node Status

This node is:
- jurisdiction-agnostic in method  
- adaptable to FOI/SAR regimes  
- designed for calm, lawful scrutiny  

It is a **lens**, not a weapon.
