# 🧰 How to Respond to “Over-Diagnosis” Claims
**First created:** 2025-12-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-16  
*Plain-language responses, logic checks, and boundary-setting scripts for when “over-diagnosis” is used to justify harm.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
“Over-diagnosis” is often deployed as a conversation-stopper: it sounds reasonable, carries moral weight, and shifts blame onto individuals.

This tool helps you respond **without over-explaining, over-disclosing, or taking on the burden of proof**.

You are not required to educate people who are using rhetoric instead of evidence.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Short, usable responses  
- Logic checks that expose the flaw quickly  
- Boundary-setting scripts that protect energy  
- No requirement to disclose personal health information  

---

## 🧿 The Basics: One-Sentence Responses

Use these when you want to stop the claim in its tracks.

- **“Where is the evidence for widespread over-diagnosis?”**  
- **“Compared to what baseline?”**  
- **“Do you mean misdiagnosis, increased access, or increased need?”**  
- **“The NHS is rationed — it doesn’t over-diagnose casually.”**  
- **“That claim asks disabled people to prove a negative.”**

Pause after asking. Silence does work.

## 🧠 Logic Checks (Internal Compass)

If you’re deciding whether to engage at all, run these checks:

- Are they offering **data**, or just repetition?  
- Are they specifying **where**, **how many**, and **by whom**?  
- Are they blaming individuals while ignoring **systems, austerity, or tech**?  
- Are they asking *you* to justify your existence or care?  

If yes → this is rhetoric, not debate.

## 📊 Common Stats Traps (and How to Exit Them)

### Trap 1: “Rates have gone up”
**Response:**  
“Increased diagnosis doesn’t equal over-diagnosis. It can reflect access, recognition, or stress.”

### Trap 2: “It’s a trend”
**Response:**  
“Trends require evidence of false positives, not just visibility.”

### Trap 3: “People are gaming the system”
**Response:**  
“The system is slow, adversarial, and risky. That’s not how gaming works.”

### Trap 4: “Some people regret diagnosis”
**Response:**  
“Individual harm doesn’t justify restricting access for everyone.”

---

## 🧯 Boundary-Setting Scripts (Use These Verbatim)

When you don’t want to debate:

- **“I’m not discussing my health to justify policy opinions.”**  
- **“That framing harms disabled people, so I’m stepping out.”**  
- **“This conversation assumes bad faith toward patients — I’m not engaging with that.”**  
- **“If you have evidence, cite it. Otherwise, I’m done here.”**

You are allowed to disengage.

## 🛡️ If You’re Put on the Spot (Meetings / Media)

### Neutral professional response:
> “That’s a serious claim. It would need clear evidence distinguishing misdiagnosis from increased need or access.”

### Values-based response:
> “Framing care as excess while services are rationed sends the wrong signal.”

### Systems-based response:
> “If diagnosis is rising, we should examine stressors and system design, not blame patients.”

## 🧩 Reframing Moves (Change the Question)

Instead of defending diagnosis, redirect:

- From **“Why are people getting diagnosed?”**  
  → **“What pressures make diagnosis necessary for access?”**

- From **“Is this over-medicalisation?”**  
  → **“Why is support only available through medical labels?”**

- From **“Isn’t this too costly?”**  
  → **“Why is cost pressure placed on individuals rather than systems?”**

---

## 🧠 If the Claim Is Political (Not Curious)

Use one of these:

- **“That line is usually used to justify cuts. Is that what you’re proposing?”**  
- **“Are you planning to regulate platforms and reduce economic pressure, or just criticise patients?”**  
- **“Without system reform, this framing causes harm.”**

Make them own the implication.

---

## 🚪 When to Walk Away

Leave the conversation if:
- your dignity is being negotiated  
- you’re asked to disclose personal details  
- the same point is repeated without evidence  
- the goalposts keep moving  

Leaving is not losing. It is **refusing extraction**.
