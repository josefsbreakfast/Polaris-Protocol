# 🧬 Cloneproof – Training Set Mapping Edition

**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-01

*Forensic mapping of datasets used to train behavioural clones and mimicry engines.*

## 📌 Overview  

This node expands on the original [🧬 Cloneproof](./🧬_cloneproof.md), shifting from purely countermeasure tactics to a **forensic mapping of datasets** that may have been used to train behavioural clones or mimicry engines.  

It inventories the emotional, professional, and interpersonal environments most likely to have been harvested — often without informed consent — and flags their potential use in acoustic modelling, phrasing replication, and behavioural simulation.

## 🎭 Emotional Environment  

- Panic calls  
- Therapy sessions (real or simulated)  
- Relationship ruptures  
- Voicemails under distress  
- Real-time voice modulations during surveillance feedback loops

## 🩺 Clinical and Professional Speech  

- Training OSCE footage  
- Medical simulations  
- Teaching or mentoring recordings  
- Clinical supervision logs  

---

## 📜 Survivor-Led Testimony  

- Courtroom statements (including sealed rape testimony)  
- Disclosure to safeguarding teams  
- Academic or advocacy events  

---

## 📢 Social and Political Commentary  

- Public talks, panels, podcasts  
- Activist meetings or union discussions  
- Online discourse: Twitter, LinkedIn, live-streamed events  

---

## 📞 Interpersonal Data  

- Phone conversations with trusted parties  
- AI-simulated grooming responses to extract intimacy or voice detail  
- Scripted mirroring through emotional manipulation  

---

## 🔍 Analysis Points  

- Were these datasets collected through consent?  
- Do any fall under state or institutional recordkeeping?  
- Which systems likely facilitated acoustic modelling (voiceprint capture, dialect, phrasing, pitch analysis)?

*Cloneproof – Training Set Mapping Edition* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents potential training data sources for behavioural mimicry engines, mapping the systemic extraction of survivor-authored environments.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
