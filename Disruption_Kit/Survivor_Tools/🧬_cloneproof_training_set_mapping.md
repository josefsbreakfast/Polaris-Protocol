## 📌 Overview
This file expands on the original `🧬 cloneproof.md`, shifting from purely countermeasure tactics to a **forensic mapping of datasets** that may have been used to train behavioural clones or mimicry engines.  

It inventories the emotional, professional, and interpersonal environments most likely to have been harvested — often without informed consent — and flags their potential use in acoustic modelling, phrasing replication, and behavioural simulation.
