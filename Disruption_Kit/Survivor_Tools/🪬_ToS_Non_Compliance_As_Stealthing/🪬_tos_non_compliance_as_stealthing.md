# ü™¨ ToS Non-Compliance as Stealthing
**First created:** 2025-10-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-06  
*When platforms quietly break their own terms, they bypass consent in ways analogous to sexual stealthing: the promised ‚Äúprotection‚Äù is secretly removed while exposure and harm are increased.*

## Why this analogy (and its limits)
- **Core claim:** Terms of Service (ToS) are the *explicit condom* of platform consent. Non-compliance is the *secret removal*‚Äîusers‚Äô risk calculus is invalidated without their informed agreement.  
- **Why it matters:** It reframes ‚Äúminor policy drift‚Äù as **non-consensual exposure** to surveillance, exploitation, and reputational or physical risk.  
- **Limit:** This is an **ethical/structural analogy**, not an equivalence of trauma. It exposes consent and power failures in socio-technical systems.

## Working definitions
- **ToS Non-Compliance:** Platform/app/host actions that breach their own stated policies (collection, retention, moderation, throttling, visibility, data sale/sharing, safety tools).  
- **Stealthing Analogy:** Removal or negation of the advertised consent *conditions* after consent was given *because* those conditions existed.  
- **Harm Envelope:** The difference between what users reasonably relied upon and what actually happened.

## Pattern map
1. **Silent setting shifts** ‚Äî default toggles change (privacy, sharing, discovery).  
2. **Selective enforcement** ‚Äî rules used against critics, waived for friends/advertisers.  
3. **Opaque ‚Äúpilot exceptions‚Äù** ‚Äî internal whitelists/flags trump public policy.  
4. **Retrograde updates** ‚Äî policy text ‚Äúclarified‚Äù *after* behaviour changes.  
5. **Appeal theatre** ‚Äî pathways exist but are rate-limited, looped, or non-binding.  
6. **Data path detours** ‚Äî telemetry/SDK partners expand scope beyond declared sinks.  
7. **Moderation as cover** ‚Äî safety labels justify *reach throttling* of lawful speech.  
8. **Vendor pass-through** ‚Äî third-party processors do what the platform claims it doesn‚Äôt.

## Harm model
- **Consent collapse:** Users cannot meaningfully accept risk if guardrails are fictive.  
- **Asymmetric exposure:** Marginalised users are over-indexed for ‚Äúpilot‚Äù harms and visibility throttles.  
- **Record contamination:** Non-compliant flows seed downstream profiling used by insurers, employers, or the state.  
- **Redress inversion:** Burden of proof shifts to the user, who lacks audit access.

## Diagnostic checklist (quick triage)
- Did the platform do anything that contradicts its own ToS, Help Center, or regulatory filings?  
- Were risk-relevant defaults changed without clear, timely, high-salience notice?  
- Is there policy carve-out language that maps to secret flags/lists?  
- Do appeal channels loop or produce non-answers within SLA windows?  
- Are analytics/telemetry vendors listed, and do their docs imply broader use than the ToS states?

## Evidence hooks
- Before/after screenshots of settings & policy pages (with timestamps).  
- Header traces / SDK calls that reveal undeclared data sinks.  
- Moderation/appeal ticket IDs + latencies + template responses.  
- Reach/visibility metrics around flagged content vs. comparable controls.  
- Copies of partner privacy policies contradicting the platform‚Äôs statements.

## Red-line tests
- **No secret flags** that alter rights/visibility without user-facing disclosure.  
- **No retroactive ‚Äúclarifications‚Äù** to legitimise already-deployed behaviour.  
- **No partner processing** beyond enumerated purposes and durations.  
- **Appeals with teeth:** binding SLAs, human review, and escalation to independent adjudicators.

## Countermeasures (survivor-first)
- **Dual capture:** mirror every important act (post/upload/appeal) with off-platform evidence.  
- **Contract trace:** cite the exact ToS clause breached in any complaint; demand specific remediation.  
- **Public ledgering:** publish reproducible tests when safe; treat ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù as admissions of prior non-compliance.  
- **Route diversity:** avoid single-point platforms for critical speech; maintain syndication pathways.  
- **Collective leverage:** coordinate complaint windows to raise regulatory materiality.

## Governance levers (overview)
- **Unfair commercial practice** (misrepresentation of services/features).  
- **Data protection** (purpose limitation, transparency, DPIAs).  
- **Advertising standards** (claims vs. reality).  
- **Contract law** (reasonable reliance & detrimental reliance).  
- **Competition** (self-preferencing & discriminatory enforcement).

## Open questions
- What minimum **salience standard** should apply to risk-relevant changes?  
- How to operationalise **independent audit** for moderation and ranking?  
- What **per-incident remedies** best reverse asymmetric exposure (e.g., guaranteed amplification credits, data deletion with partner attestations)?
