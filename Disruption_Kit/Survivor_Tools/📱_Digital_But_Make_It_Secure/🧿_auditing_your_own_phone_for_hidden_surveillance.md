## 🧭 Orientation  
This node teaches how to **inspect your phone safely** when you suspect spyware, hidden profiles, or cloned accounts.  
The aim is not panic or total reset — it’s evidence, control, and recovery in sequence.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Audit  

1. **App & Icon Sweep** — Settings ▸ Apps ▸ See All (Android) / iPhone Storage.  
   - Look for blank icons, duplicate “system” apps, or tools you didn’t install.  

2. **Device Admin & Profiles**  
   - iPhone → Settings ▸ VPN & Device Management.  
   - Android → Settings ▸ Security ▸ Device admin apps.  
   - Remove any MDM or admin access not set by you.

3. **Accessibility Permissions**  
   - Only assistive apps should appear.  
   - Revoke all unknown services.

4. **Location Sharing & Accounts**  
   - Check *Find My / Google Maps* for unwanted shares.  
   - Verify account list for duplicates.

5. **Backups & Sync**  
   - iCloud or Google Drive → check for unfamiliar device backups.  

6. **Battery & Network Checks**  
   - Sudden drain or heat = possible background sync.  
   - Use Lockdown Privacy / NetGuard to see hidden connections.

7. **Camera & Microphone Permissions**  
   - Revoke access for non-essential apps.  

8. **Physical Inspection**  
   - Check SIM number, case seams, and external plugs for trackers.

## 🧠 If You Find Something  

1. **Photograph before removal.**  
2. **Do not confront immediately.**  
3. **Contact trusted orgs:** Refuge Tech Abuse Team (UK), National Stalking Helpline, EFF.  
4. **Then clean reinstall:** logout → reset → reinstall only essentials → change passwords elsewhere.
