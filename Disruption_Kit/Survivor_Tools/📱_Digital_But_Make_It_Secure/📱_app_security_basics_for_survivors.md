## 🔍 Quick-Check Tier System  

| Tier | Meaning | What to Look For |
|------|----------|------------------|
| 🟢 **Low risk / legitimate** | Strong encryption + minimal permissions. | Messaging apps with **end-to-end encryption** (e.g. Signal, iMessage between Apple devices, WhatsApp if both sides updated). |
| 🟠 **Moderate risk** | Encryption in transit only. Metadata (who/when) still visible. | Apps that say “encrypted” but don’t specify *end-to-end*. |
| 🔴 **High risk / surveillance-capable** | Demands excessive permissions or hides itself. | Requests access to *Location*, *Microphone*, *Camera*, *Contacts*, *Files*, *Accessibility Services* when not needed. |
| ⚫️ **Coercive control tools** | Designed for remote monitoring, GPS stalking, or call recording. | Phrases like *“monitor loved ones,” “view messages remotely,” “employee tracking.”* |

## 🧠 If You Suspect Stalkerware  

1. **Do not factory-reset immediately.**  
2. **Photograph screens** showing suspicious apps or permissions.  
3. **Use a safe device** (friend’s phone or public computer) to look up removal steps.  
4. **Seek specialist help:** Refuge Tech Abuse Team (UK), Coalition Against Stalkerware, Electronic Frontier Foundation.
