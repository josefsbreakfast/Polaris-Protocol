# 🎙️ Cloneproof Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-10-31 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-07  
*Authenticity architectures for voice, data, and identity integrity in post‑synthetic environments.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The **Cloneproof Protocol** cluster documents the practical side of voice fidelity: how to verify, watermark, and preserve authorship in a landscape where imitation is effortless. It maps the overlap between digital forensics, ethics, and survivor protection—the infrastructure that allows people to prove *who is speaking* and *what was really said.*

> *If imitation is inevitable, integrity must become measurable.*

---

## ⚖️ Intent  

To build the **integrity scaffolding** that *Voice Disruption* exposes as missing: a set of interoperable standards, checklists, and ethical algorithms that make manipulation visible. Cloneproofing is not a product but a culture of verification—one that treats every recording, transcript, and dataset as a site of care.

*🎙️ Cloneproof Protocol* anchors the technical‑ethical interface of the **Polaris Protocol**. It provides the tools that let governance and narrative clusters test themselves for truth drift. Where *Voice Disruption* describes the loss of trust, *Cloneproof* designs its restoration.
