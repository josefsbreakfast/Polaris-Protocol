*How to distinguish ordinary SEO volatility from infrastructure-level pressure without spiralling*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This Survivor Tool helps individuals and groups identify **early, low-drama indicators** that their site or content may be experiencing **crawl-layer or indexing pressure**, rather than ordinary SEO fluctuation.

It is designed for:
- Non-technical site owners
- Small organisations and civic groups
- Independent media and researchers
- Anyone optimising content without direct server access

This tool is **diagnostic, not accusatory**.  
Most SEO problems are mundane. This helps you tell when something *isn’t*.

---

## 🧭 Ground Rule (Read First)  

Before using this checklist:

- One signal means nothing  
- Two signals mean “pay attention”  
- **Patterns over time** are what matter  

If this tool increases anxiety rather than clarity, **stop**. The goal is steadiness, not vigilance theatre.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- No log access required  
- No attribution assumptions  
- No technical escalation by default  
- Focus on *change patterns*, not single events  

---

## 🧿 The Checklist  

### 1. Disproportionate Crawl Attention to Low-Value Pages  

Watch for:
- Sudden indexing of old, thin, or irrelevant pages
- Parameterised URLs appearing in Search Console
- Search results surfacing pages you wouldn’t promote

⚠️ *Note:* This matters only if it **persists**.

---

### 2. Indexing Volatility Without Content Change  

Red flags include:
- Pages dropping and reappearing without edits
- Canonicals being ignored intermittently
- “Discovered — currently not indexed” cycling repeatedly

If content, internal links, and publishing cadence are stable, volatility deserves a second look.

---

### 3. Performance Signals That Don’t Match User Experience  

Examples:
- Search Console flags “slow” pages users report as fine
- Mobile performance warnings without design changes
- Crawled pages timing out while browsers load normally

This can indicate crawler-specific stress, not user-facing failure.

---

### 4. Fragmentation of Narrative Pages  

Notice if:
- Supporting pages rank while core explainers disappear
- Old drafts outrank updated statements
- Context pages lose visibility while excerpts persist

This is **narrative dilution**, not simple ranking loss.

---

### 5. SEO “Fixes” Stop Working  

Be cautious if:
- Standard best practices produce diminishing returns
- Each fix briefly helps, then collapses again
- You’re advised to keep “tuning” without clear diagnosis

This is a common exhaustion loop.

---

### 6. Uneven Impact Across Similar Content  

Compare:
- Similar pages with different crawl behaviour
- Comparable posts with divergent indexing
- New content failing while archives resurface

Asymmetry matters more than decline.

---

## 🧠 How to Interpret What You See  

Ask these grounding questions:

- Is this **persistent** or episodic?  
- Is it **structural** (indexing, crawling) or **editorial** (content quality)?  
- Is the effect **diffuse** or concentrated on specific areas?  

Avoid asking “who would do this?”  
That question comes *later*, if ever.

---

## 🛑 When *Not* to Escalate  

Do **not** escalate if:
- Traffic dips align with known updates
- Issues resolve within weeks
- Changes follow site redesigns or migrations
- Only one signal appears

Most SEO pain is not interference.

---

## 🧩 What *Is* in Your Control  

Low-cost stabilisers:
- Tighten internal linking to core pages
- Reduce URL sprawl where possible
- Clarify canonical intent
- Pause reactive optimisation cycles
- Document changes instead of chasing them

Stability is protective.

---

## 🌱 Psychological Safety Note  

Ambiguous technical problems can trigger:
- Self-blame  
- Hyper-optimisation  
- Loss of confidence  
- Group friction  

If this tool starts driving distress, **step back**.  
Your work matters more than any dashboard.
