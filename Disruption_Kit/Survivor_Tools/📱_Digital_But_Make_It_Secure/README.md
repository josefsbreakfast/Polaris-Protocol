# 📱 Digital But Make It Secure  
**First created:** 2025-10-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-17  
*A survivor-led toolkit for private communication, app literacy, and forensic self-audit.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This cluster gathers three linked survivor tools designed to rebuild digital safety, one layer at a time:  
1. **Recognise** when an app or system might be unsafe.  
2. **Verify** whether its encryption and data promises are real.  
3. **Audit** your own phone if something feels wrong.  

Each can stand alone, or work as a three-step recovery path after interference or coercive control.
