*What to do when a comment section turns weird.*

---

## 🛰️ If you see this…  
- Lots of comments  
- Very few likes  
- Same 3–4 talking points  
- Flat, repetitive tone  
- No real debate  

Pause. That’s the pattern.

---

## ✅ Do this instead  

☑️ Don’t argue in the thread  
☑️ Post **one** anchor comment (max)  
☑️ Screenshot repetition quietly  
☑️ Share the issue *outside* the thread  
☑️ Contact MPs / broadcasters  
☑️ Encourage non-activists to speak  

---

## 🗳️ Anchor comment you can copy  
> “You don’t have to support the protest to support keeping people alive.”

---

## ❌ Don’t do this  

☒ Don’t reply repeatedly  
☒ Don’t accuse without evidence  
☒ Don’t assume the comments reflect public opinion  
☒ Don’t purity-test potential allies  
☒ Don’t escalate emotionally  

---

## 🧠 Remember  
The audience is not the commenters.  
The audience is everyone quietly watching.

Make empathy visible.
