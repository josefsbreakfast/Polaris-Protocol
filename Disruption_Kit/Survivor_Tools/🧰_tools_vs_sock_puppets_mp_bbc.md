# 🧰 Toolset Add-On: MP & BBC Contact Templates  
**First created:** 2025-12-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-23  
*Low-friction messages that convert concern into institutional permission.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
These templates are designed for people who:
- don’t identify as activists,
- don’t want to argue online,
- but do not want people to die.

They are intentionally short, non-partisan, and outcome-focused.

## 🏛️ Template: Contacting Your MP  

**Subject:** Concern about hunger strikes — request for intervention

> Dear [MP’s name],  
>  
> I am a constituent in [your postcode area].  
>  
> I am concerned that British citizens are currently on hunger strike, with a foreseeable risk of death. Whatever one’s views on the protest itself, I believe it is important that no one dies and that all reasonable steps are taken to resolve the situation safely.  
>  
> I am asking you to raise this issue and support action that prevents loss of life.  
>  
> Kind regards,  
> [Your name]  
> [Postcode]

## 📡 Template: BBC Audience Feedback  

> I am writing as a licence fee payer to say that hunger strikes by British citizens are a legitimate matter of public interest.  
>  
> Reporting on the risk to life is not endorsement of a protest — it is basic humanitarian coverage.  
>  
> I would expect the BBC to reflect that concern clearly and proportionately.

## 🧠 Why this works  
- It uses a postcode (this matters).  
- It avoids ideological language.  
- It frames action as *preventing harm*, not “taking sides”.  
- It gives institutions permission, not ultimatums.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Toolset Add-On: MP & BBC Contact Templates* is a practical extension of the Polaris Protocol.  
It prioritises institutional leverage over online noise.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
