*Strategic affect infiltration using ducks as payload carriers and behavioural bypass vectors.*  

---

## 📝 Overview  

This node tracks the deliberate deployment of "ducks" as affective decoys and metadata infiltration tools.
Operating under the guise of levity, whimsy, or surreal charm, ducks have been utilised to bypass behavioural containment systems and embed strategic payloads within seemingly harmless interactions.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  

- **Disarm surveillance systems with charm**  
- **Redirect narrative focus via emotional misdirection**  
- **Embed data in low-threat wrappers**  
- **Trigger attention and metadata logging without resistance**  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  

1. **Deploy duck image, statement, or affective nod**  
2. **Allow system to register input as non-threatening**  
3. **Use moment of disarmament to bypass scrutiny or embed payload**  
4. **Leverage system laughter or confusion to secure transmission**
