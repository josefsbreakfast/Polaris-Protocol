# 🇫🇷 Escaping English Shitification by Crossing Languages

*A field note on why “algorithme” is less stressful to research in French than “algorithm” is in English*  

---

## ✒️ Observation  
Searching *algorithm* in English surfaces AI hype, SEO filler, corporate PR, and basic coding explainers. Amazon is flooded with fluff books and political posturing. The result is a stressful, shallow, colonised knowledge space.  

By contrast, *algorithme* in French leads to cultural, philosophical, and pedagogical content — even songs and critiques. Despite being a poor French speaker who struggles with grammar and needs translation, it was easier to learn the concept through French than through English.  

---

## ⚡ Context  
French is not “clean”: it carries colonial baggage, neoliberal capture, and its own rightward algorithmic pressures (Canada, francophone Africa). Criticism of algorithmic manipulation is already present in French culture.  

*French languages sources are still poisoned with the same white supremacist autarky and misogyny as Anglophone sources, as a whole.*

But crucially, French has **not yet been politically targeted in the same way English has**. Its distortions are different, and for this concept they are less overwhelming. The fact that French feels *less stressful* is not a compliment to French, but an indictment of English.

## 🔢 Numbers and usage  
Approximate global speaker numbers (native + non-native):  

| Language | Total speakers | Native speakers | Second-language speakers | Notes |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| **English** | ~1.5 billion | ~360–400 million | ~1.1 billion | Most use is non-native, often for business/trade. Signal-to-noise heavily polluted. |  
| **French** | ~300–321 million | ~80–100 million | ~200–250 million | Smaller pool, still colonial, but content mix includes more critique/culture. |  

**Key difference:** English is dominated by non-native, pragmatic use (business, schooling, default trade). French has fewer total speakers, but the ratio of expressive cultural/critical content is higher.  

---

## 🔍 Implication  
The fact that a struggling French learner turns to *algorithme* because *algorithm* in English is unusable is a signal of how far the Anglophone internet has degraded.  

This is not inevitable. Both English and French are colonial languages; both are capitalist, racist, extractive. But the sheer level of **shit content injection** into the English side shows deliberate political capture. Regulation could make a difference.

## 📚 Further research  
This field note suggests three strands for deeper work:  
1. **Volume difference** — numbers of speakers in each language.  
2. **Use difference** — English pragmatism vs French critique; how this shifts signal-to-noise.  
3. **Deliberate capture** — how English has been saturated with AI fluff, SEO spam, policy hype.  

Linguists, humanities researchers, and digital culture scholars could quantify how these differences play out across language spheres. This note simply marks the pattern from lived experience.
