# ⛳️ Capture the Flag — *Control Room* (Satirical, Hypothetical)

**Status:** Fictional / satirical game design (for creative play, tabletop sessions, or writing workshops).  
**Tone:** Dark comedy / political satire. Not an operations manual. Do not use for real crowd-control, surveillance, or harm.

## Premise (fictional)
In a near-future municipal control room, two teams — **Red** and **Blue** — compete in a capture-the-flag style simulation. Each team uses a mix of narrative tools, social engineering, and theatrical “metadata” plays to win public attention, protect a flagship object (the Flag), or disrupt the opponent’s plans. The point is to rehearse how narratives, confusion, and symbolic gestures change perception — as satire and storytelling, not as a how-to.

---

## Players & Setup
- **Players:** 4–12 (split into two teams). Solo GM optional.  
- **Teams:** Red Team (Disruptors) vs Blue Team (Containment / PR).  
- **Duration:** 30–90 minutes (configurable).  
- **Props:** index cards, sticky notes, timer, 2 coloured flags (or tokens), whiteboard or shared document for metadata feed.  
- **Optional:** a “Control Room” board where each team pins cards representing assets, motifs, and channels.

## Neutral Actor — “Britannia” (City-State Referee)
In this satire, **Britannia** isn’t a team but a neutral city-state/referee:

- **Status:** Starts neutral. Controls rules and adjudicates disputes.  
- **Traits:** Internally divided; can be swayed by shiny things (Pearls, Gold, Diamonds) or by appeals to pride, nostalgia, or flattery.  
- **Mechanic:** Each round Britannia rolls a d6. On 1–3 they enforce rules strictly, on 4–5 they look the other way, on 6 they actively favour the team that made the best offer.  
- **Influence Tokens:** Each team starts with 3 “Shiny Things” tokens. Teams may offer these to Britannia to sway a ruling. If Britannia accepts, they act favourably that turn; if not, the token is wasted.

(This keeps the satirical flavour: a referee who can be charmed, bribed, or guilted — very Civ city-state.)

## Living Flag Rule (Blue Team)
- On Blue Team, one player must volunteer (or be chosen) to act as **The Flag**.  
- The Flag wears a conspicuous helmet/hat with a tall flag mounted on top (practicality: looks absurd; theatricality: instantly legible).  
- **Constraints for the Flag-player:**  
  - Cannot take normal Actions.  
  - May only speak when directly addressed (unless GM rules otherwise).  
  - Must remain physically present on the board/table and be defended.  
- **Capture Conditions:** To “capture” the living Flag, Red must both:  
  1. Generate ≥3 **Confusion Points** in a single round, **and**  
  2. Spend a Physical Move action while Blue has <2 Trust Tokens.  
- **If captured:** Flag-player is moved to Red’s base. Blue can recover the Flag only if they spend 2 consecutive turns building Trust Tokens and a Shield.  
- **Satirical effect:** Emphasises how people are turned into symbols — the helmet/flag hat is ridiculous in public, and in a city like London people will probably just shrug (“oh, they’re doing a bit”).

---

## Objectives
- **Red Team (Offensive Storycraft):** Capture the opponent’s Living Flag by creating a sustained metadata storm that forces Blue to publicly react OR by physically seizing the Flag during a distraction turn.  
- **Blue Team (Defensive Narrative / Containment):** Protect the Flag-player, defuse Red’s narratives, and keep public sentiment neutral or favourable.  

Victory is achieved by capture (Red) or successful defence for the agreed number of rounds/time (Blue). Score modifiers awarded for elegance, satire, minimal harm, and creativity.

## Core Mechanics (fictional & playful)
> NOTE: mechanics use *fictional* abstractions like “metadata tokens”, “confusion points”, and “pulse checks” — these are narrative game tokens, **not** instructions.

1. **Assets & Channels**  
   - Each team starts with 5 asset cards (examples: *Meme Drop*, *Local Anchor*, *Old Tweet*, *Tarot Thread*, *Anonymous Tip*).  
   - Each team has 3 Channels (e.g., Microblog, Longform, Community Forum). Channels cost energy to activate.

2. **Turns**  
   - Play in rounds. Each round each team gets **3 Actions** from: Deploy Asset, Amplify (boost a previous asset), Counter (respond to opposing asset), Recon (peek at opponent’s visible assets), or Physical Move (attempt to move/capture the Flag).  
   - After both teams act, the GM runs a **Metadata Feed**: a short, flavourful sentence generated from the public board (e.g., “Local anchor tweets: ‘strange rumor re: mayor’s speech’ — +1 confusion”).

3. **Tokens**  
   - **Confusion Points (CP):** Earned when an asset creates contradictory micro-narratives. High CP makes public perception volatile.  
   - **Trust Tokens (TT):** Earned by Blue for clear messaging; lost if they scramble.  
   - **Pulse Checks:** If a team hits a sensitive motif (pre-agreed as off-limits or “hot”), there’s an immediate pulse: lose or gain tokens depending on elegance.

4. **Flag Moves (Living Flag)**  
   - The living Flag is physically present. To steal them, Red must meet the Capture Conditions above (≥3 CP + Physical Move while Blue <2 TT).  
   - Blue may Protect by spending Actions to deploy *Shield* assets or move the Flag into “secure mode” (costly).

5. **Ethics Meter (Important)**  
   - Before play, define motifs that are **forbidden** (real health diagnoses, doxxing, private financials). Crossing the Ethics Meter is an instant loss for that round and grants the opponent a creative bonus. Keeps the satire from sliding into real harm.

## Role Suggestions & Play Styles
- **Red Team Roles**  
  - *The Troll Bard* — crafts short, provocative one-liners and memes.  
  - *The Filmmaker* — makes plausible “found footage” or edits (purely fictional).  
  - *The Strategist* — runs the decision-tree, times distractions.

- **Blue Team Roles**  
  - *The Anchor* — issues calming narratives and tries to convert CP to TT.  
  - *The Analyst* — reads the Metadata Feed, spots pulses and suggests counters.  
  - *The Logistics Lead* — manages the Flag’s position and recovery plans.

- **GM / Referee**  
  - Mediates the Metadata Feed, adjudicates pulse outcomes, enforces the Ethics Meter, and runs Britannia’s d6.

## Sample Round (short)
1. **Setup:** Both teams start with 5 assets. Forbidden motifs: actual health conditions, real bank data, doxxing.  
2. **Red Action 1:** Deploy *Tarot Thread* — GM awards +1 CP.  
   **Red Action 2:** Amplify *Tarot Thread* via Microblog — +1 CP.  
   **Red Action 3:** Recon Blue public board.  
3. **Blue Action 1:** Deploy *Official Statement* (Anchor) on Longform — converts 1 CP → 1 TT.  
   **Blue Action 2:** Amplify *Community Outreach* — +1 TT.  
   **Blue Action 3:** Shield (protect living Flag) — reduces chance of capture.  
4. **Metadata Feed:** “Local forum inflamed; anchor replies. Public mood: confused but listening.” (Net result: CP=1, TT=2).  
5. **Outcome:** No capture; turn passes.

## Scoring & Victory
- **Capture (Red wins):** Red steals the living Flag by meeting capture conditions.  
- **Defence (Blue wins):** Blue keeps Flag and finishes X rounds.  
- **Bonus Scoring (subjective):** +2 for satire finesse, +2 for ethical play, −3 for crossing Ethics Meter (instant loss).

---

## Twists & House Rules (for spice)
- **Yo-Yo Economy:** A symbolic “wealth” card that acts as a red herring.  
- **Penguin Option:** If a player invokes “penguins,” both teams pause for 90s and swap one asset — a humorous meta-reset.  
- **Six-Month Countdown:** A weird, undefined timer that acts as atmospheric pressure rather than a strict mechanic.  
- **London Shrug:** If played in a big city (e.g., London) the living Flag helmet + flag will likely be seen by passersby as a bit of theatre — people may laugh or ignore it, which can be counted as a spontaneous public-perception modifier.

---

## Debrief (recommended)
After play, spend 10–20 minutes debriefing:
- What did you learn about narrative levers?  
- Which tactics felt exploitative or uncomfortable?  
- Which assets produced the most creative, least harmful chaos?

---

## Safety & Ethics (explicit)
This game is satire. Do **not**:
- Probe or exploit real people’s private data, medical information, or finances.  
- Use the game as a blueprint to harass, stalk, or manipulate real people.  
- Normalize or glorify sexual violence, doxxing, or harm. If a round leans into that area, stop, rewind, and enforce the Ethics Meter.
