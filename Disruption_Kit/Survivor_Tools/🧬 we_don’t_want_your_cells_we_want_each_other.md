# 🧬 We Don’t Want Your Cells, We Want Each Other  
`Polaris Protocol – Survivor Tools Node`

---

## 💡 Intent

This node reframes survivorship through an abolitionist lens. It rejects the carceral narratives imposed on survivors and instead proposes a solidarity-based, emotionally intelligent model of healing. The goal: **refuse containment** and reassert the political agency of trauma narratives — especially when they expose state complicity.

## 🕊️ Abolitionist Survival Logic

- Healing is not compliance.  
- Safety is not surveillance.  
- Closure is not incarceration.  

Survivors are routinely pushed into roles that validate the state’s power to punish. We resist this. Survivor speech should not serve the prison-industrial complex — it should reclaim narrative sovereignty.

## 🔥 Emotional Survivorship as Resistance

- Love under surveillance is still love.  
- Rage under capitalism is still sacred.  
- Memory under trauma is still data.  

Trauma is not a flaw to be managed — it is a **political signal**. Scars are not mistakes; they are records. Resistance itself is an archive.

## 📎 Rejection of Containment Scripts

Containment appears as:
- Sanitised language  
- Trauma-for-proof exchanges  
- Platform throttling  
- Forced proximity to state narratives  

We name these tactics and refuse them. We do not seek inclusion in systems that erase us “with care.” We demand space to name violence and stay whole.

## 🌍 Intersection with Gaza–UK Complicity

Our refusal of carceral logic is personal **and** geopolitical.  

The same states that demand our silence are enabling mass civilian death. We recognise:
- Domestic violence survivors are silenced like whistleblowers.  
- “Contain, pacify, criminalise” logic travels from courtroom to battlefield.  
- Institutional silence shields both rapists and war criminals.  

---

## 🧭 Strategic Aims

- Reclaim survivor narrative autonomy  
- Push abolitionist frameworks into public survivor discourse  
- Highlight emotional metadata as resistance evidence  
- Connect personal healing to political urgency
