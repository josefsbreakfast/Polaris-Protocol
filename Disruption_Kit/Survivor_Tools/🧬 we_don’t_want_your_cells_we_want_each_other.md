`Polaris Protocol – Survivor Tools Node`

## 💡 Intent

This document reframes survivorship through an abolitionist lens. It challenges the dominant carceral narratives often imposed on survivors and instead proposes a solidarity-based, emotionally intelligent model of healing. The goal is to reject containment and reassert the political agency of trauma narratives—especially when used to expose complicity at the state level.

## 🕊️ Abolitionist Survival Logic

- Healing is not compliance.
- Safety is not surveillance.
- Closure is not incarceration.

Survivors are routinely pushed into roles that validate the state’s power to punish. We resist this. The purpose of survivor speech is not to prop up the prison-industrial complex but to reclaim our narratives from its reach.

## 🔥 Emotional Survivorship as Resistance

- Love under surveillance is still love.
- Rage under capitalism is still sacred.
- Memory under trauma is still data.

This file holds the conviction that trauma is not a personal flaw to be managed, but a political signal that must be heard. Our scars are not mistakes. They are data. And our resistance is its own kind of archive.

## 📎 Rejection of Containment Scripts

Containment shows up as:
- Sanitised language
- Trauma-for-proof exchanges
- Platform throttling
- Forced proximity to state narratives

We name it and refuse it. We do not want to be included in systems that erase us “with care.” We want space to name violence and stay whole while doing it.

## 🌍 Intersection with Gaza–UK Complicity

Our refusal to submit to carceral logics is not only personal—it is geopolitical. 

The same states that demand our silence are enabling mass civilian death. We recognise that:
- Survivors of domestic violence are often silenced the same way as whistleblowers.
- The logic of “contain, pacify, criminalise” travels from the courtroom to the battlefield.
- Institutional silence protects both rapists and war criminals.

## 🧭 Strategic Aims

- Reclaim survivor narrative autonomy
- Push abolitionist frameworks into public survivor discourse
- Highlight emotional metadata as evidence of resistance
- Connect personal healing to political urgency
