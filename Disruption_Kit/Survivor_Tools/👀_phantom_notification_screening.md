*Guide for recognising false or mimicked notification pulses that coincide with redirected traffic events.*

---

## What This Is  
Sometimes devices (Samsung edge-light pulses, iPhone lock-screen flashes, ambient cues) show **notification-like effects without a real notification**. These phantom pulses have been observed at the exact moment traffic is **redirected, proxied, or intercepted**.  

They act like a *visual nudge* — you feel like something just came in, but when you check there’s nothing there. Most users won’t know this is a possible manipulation.  

---

## Signs to Watch  
- Edge glow / lock-screen flash without a corresponding notification badge or sound.  
- Screen pulse that disappears instantly, leaving no entry in the notification centre.  
- Coincidence with sudden page reloads, login pop-ups, or suspicious captive-portal redirects.  
- Happens across multiple apps/services, not just one app.  
- More frequent on public Wi-Fi, carrier redirects, or when using throttled/filtered networks.

## Quick Screening Questions  
1. Did I see a pulse/flash but find nothing in notifications?  
2. Was my connection just redirected, reset, or dropped?  
3. Is this happening in clusters (several pulses in a short span)?  
4. Does it persist across devices (Samsung / iPhone) on the same network?  

If **yes** to 2 or more, note the incident — it may be a mimicry event.  

---

## What To Do  
- **Document:** note time, app state, and network you were on.  
- **Capture:** if possible, screen-record or photograph the pulse.  
- **Cross-check:** run through a VPN; see if pulses vanish when your traffic can’t be redirected locally.  
- **Stay calm:** phantom notifications are disorienting, but knowing they’re fake removes their power.
