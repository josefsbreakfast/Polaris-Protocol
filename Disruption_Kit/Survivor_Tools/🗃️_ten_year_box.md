*On the lived weight of a decade inside containment choreography.*

## 🌐 The Box  
Ten years.  
Not a metaphor, not an exaggeration.  
A box built from nudges, erasures, and choreographed holes.  

Walls made from:  
- Redirected searches  
- Lost records  
- Cities cut out of reach  
- Joys flagged as error  

A decade of living inside architecture designed to miniaturise a life.

## 👁️ Visibility Shift  
The box did not arrive suddenly.  
It was always there, pressing in, shaping routes.  
What changed is visibility:  
edges sharpened,  
choreography exposed.  

Containment is loudest when it believes itself invisible.  
Now, it is seen.  

---

## 🛑 Refusal  
To name the box is to begin its unmaking.  
Ten years do not vanish.  
They become testimony.  
They become archive.  

The walls may remain,  
but recognition cuts the lock.

*Ten Year Box* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It testifies to a decade of survivor containment, naming what systems prefer to erase as “invisible infrastructure.”
