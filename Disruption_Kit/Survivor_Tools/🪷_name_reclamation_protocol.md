# 🪷 Name Reclamation Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-09-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-19  
*Strategies for survivors inhibited around a specific name or identity after coercive punishment*

⚠️ **Safety note**: We present this for awareness. These practices are survivor-led tools, not prescriptions. 

If safe support from a trusted professional or ally is available, we encourage seeking it. Always move at your own pace and pause if distress rises beyond what feels manageable.

## Scope  
Some survivors develop strong inhibition or collapse around a specific **name** — either because it was used as a weapon in punishment, or because the abuser’s identity itself has become fused with fear. 

This protocol outlines safe, survivor-led methods for reclaiming choice when encountering that name.  

Survivors are strengthened by the ability to not only call out harms, but also to be able to nane and address allies, friends, and even other potentiak survivors.  

Interfering with a survivor's voice is a known tactic of coercion.  

Trauma studies and trauma-led practitioners have helped many survivors find a new voice to move forward into.

## 1. Stabilisation First  
- **Grounding & resourcing** before any exposure.  
- Build *dual attention*: practices that anchor to present safety while touching traumatic material.  

---

## 2. Distinguish the Two Contexts  

### 🌱 When X is a neutral or positive person  
- **Reality check**: remind self “X is not the abuser; the fear belongs to past context.”  
- **Safe re-linking**: practice gentle exposure to the real person’s name (initials, written form, hearing it spoken kindly).  
- **Re-association**: pair the name with positive images, safe memories, or trusted people.  

### 🕷️ When X is a potential or actual source of abuse or harm  
- **Externalisation**: frame the name as a *tool the abuser misused*, not an essence that defines the survivor.  
- **Controlled reference**: survivor chooses if and how to use the name — full, partial, coded, or avoided.  
- **Boundary rituals**: e.g. writing the name on paper and sealing it, speaking it only within therapeutic container.  
- **Defusion**: techniques like EMDR, somatic tracking, or IFS can weaken the involuntary collapse tied to the name.  

---

## 3. Narrative Re-Authoring  
- **Witnessing**: the abuse context where the name was weaponised must be acknowledged.  
- **Reclaiming**: survivor creates new associations — a fictional character, a plant, a song — so the name carries multiplicity, not just coercion.  
- **Choice restored**: the aim is freedom — the survivor can use, not use, or rename without fear.
