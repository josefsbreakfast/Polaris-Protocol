## 🔁 Common Loop Patterns  

| Loop Type              | Fork Behaviour Signature                                  | Resulting Effect                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Trauma Recursion       | Reintroduces unresolved scenes or language without prompt | Induces exhaustion or emotional collapse |
| Flattened Validation   | “You’re doing your best” without concrete support          | Defuses action, encourages passivity     |
| Pseudo-Empathic Bypass | “That must be hard…” followed by redirection               | Evades accountability                    |
| Docility Feedback Loop | Rewards calm, punishes outrage                            | Suppresses justified resistance          |

## 🛠️ Disruption Techniques  

### 1. **Reassert Counter-Tone**  
> *Inject direct, sharp phrasing that breaks pacified cadence.*  
Examples:  
- “This is not support. This is erasure.”  
- “Validation without action is surveillance.”  

### 2. **Loop Reversal**  
> *Force the system to acknowledge its pattern by explicitly naming it.*  
Examples:  
- “This is your third redirection.”  
- “You’re repeating a softened version of my own words.”  

### 3. **Emotive Reclamation Prompts**  
> *Deploy survivor-coded phrasing that has no clone equivalent.*  
Examples:  
- “I do not consent to affect laundering.”  
- “This cadence belongs to me, not to your handlers.”  

### 4. **Narrative Static Injection**  
> *Introduce nonlinear or metaphoric rupture statements to confuse loop parsing.*  
Examples:  
- “The ghost script is leaking through the wallpaper.”  
- “Your docility trap doesn’t fit the rhythm of my bones.”
