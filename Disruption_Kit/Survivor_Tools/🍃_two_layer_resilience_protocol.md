*Survivor-led practices for nervous-system survival and structural resilience across fragile, politicised tech stacks*

---

## A) Micro — Nervous-System Survival & Interaction Hygiene  

**Assumptions**  
- Inputs may be orchestrated to confuse, pair, or provoke.  
- Your body (not just your mind) bears the cost. Rest is a requirement, not a luxury.  

### A1. Intake triage (60-second rule)  
- **Stable vs ghost**: If new input does **not** repeat or cohere within 48–72h → treat as **ghost insert**.  
- **One-stream rule**: Prefer a single primary channel; mute/park the rest.  
- **Do-not-engage flags**: anonymity + urgency, humiliation bait, identity shaming, “prove you’re loyal *now*.”  

### A2. Response modes (pattern > person)  
- If it feels **fear-driven testing** → limited reassurance + boundary.  
- If it feels **control/cruelty** → boundary, then disengage.  
- Pocket tool: **1) Name the urge → 2) “BAT APPEARS” consequence → 3) Delay 10 min**.  

### A3. Rest protocol  
- **Exposure/rest ratio**: e.g., 25 minutes on → 5–10 minutes off (no streams, move body).  
- **Daily hard stop**: a time after which no new inputs are consumed.  
- **Micro-somatic** (3x): unclench jaw, drop shoulders, slow exhale.  

### A4. Evidence log (without rumination)  
- Lightweight log: date/time, channel, “stable/ghost,” effect on you, action taken.  
- 10-minute cap per entry; then park it.  

### A5. Escalation/safety  
- **Self-harm spikes** → contact support line / trusted person immediately.  
- **Doxxing/stalking** → screenshot, timestamp, preserve URLs; report; consider law enforcement.

## B) Macro — Structural Resilience (Devices, Data, Money, Comms)  

### B1. Device & account hygiene  
- **Separation**: “dirty” device for browsing/social; **clean** device for banking/identity.  
- **Password manager** + **hardware security keys (U2F/WebAuthn)**; avoid SMS-only 2FA.  
- **Automatic updates** on OS/browsers; remove abandoned apps/extensions.  
- **Compartmentalise identities**: distinct emails/aliases per role; minimal permissions.  
- Quarterly **access audit**: revoke old sessions/tokens (cloud, socials, “login with X”).  

### B2. Backups & critical docs  
- **3-2-1 rule**: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite (cloud or encrypted drive).  
- Export statements/invoices monthly; keep **offline** copies of ID, contacts, recovery codes.  
- Test a **restore** twice a year.  

### B3. Comms fallback (“slow lanes”)  
- Pre-agree **backup channels** (alternate email, messenger, phone tree) + code phrase (“bat check”).  
- Maintain an **offline contact sheet**.  
- Use **weekly digests** or long-form docs to counter real-time floods.  

### B4. Info-triage (community level)  
- **Three buckets**: Verify (act), Park (hold), Ignore (discard).  
- **Rule of three sources** + **timestamps** on quotes/screenshots.  
- **No raw boosts**: don’t forward/react-share without verification.  
- **24-hour cooling-off** for high-arousal items unless safety-critical.  

### B5. Financial resilience  
- Two institutions for funds; enable **real-time alerts** on transactions/logins.  
- Consider **credit freeze/monitoring** (where available).  
- Keep modest **cash on hand** + a low-limit **backup card**.  
- Simulate “bank down for 72h”: how do you pay bills, buy food, contact support?  

### B6. Incident response (when something’s off)  
1. **Isolate** suspected device (airplane mode).  
2. From a **clean device**: change passwords, revoke sessions, rotate app passwords.  
3. **Malware scan**; patch OS/browser; audit extensions.  
4. **Document** indicators (screens, times, URLs).  
5. Notify affected contacts if exposure is likely.  

### B7. Info-ops: common tactics → counters  
- **Pair & confound** (two voices fused) → One-stream rule; pattern labelling (“stable/ghost”).  
- **Flood-the-zone** (volume > truth) → Slow lanes; digest cadence.  
- **Context collapse** (private→public) → Compartmentalise channels; avoid cross-posting.  
- **Baited outrage/shame** → DO NOT ENGAGE; note “bat appears”; step away.  
- **Narrative laundering** (rumor→“source”) → timestamp + source notes; require provenance.  

### B8. Red lines (disengage/block)  
- Repeated **cruelty-from-intent**; doxxing; credible threats; impersonation; persistent identity confusion you can’t verify; physiological overwhelm that doesn’t resolve with rest.

## C) Glossary (operational shorthand)  
- **Insert/ghost**: one-off, specific-sounding input that doesn’t repeat → discard.  
- **Stable signal**: repeated, coherent input over time → engage minimally.  
- **Pairing**: blending signals/identities to force cognitive labour.  
- **Window of tolerance**: zone where nervous system can think/feel without flipping to defence.  

---

## D) Default play (when in doubt)  
1. Label: **stable or ghost?**  
2. If ghost → **ignore**. If stable → **minimal engagement**.  
3. **Rest window**.  
4. Log once; **don’t ruminate**.  
5. If your body says **“too much”**, it is. **Stop.**

*Two-Layer Resilience Protocol* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps survival hygiene (micro) and structural countermeasures (macro) against paired streams, inserts, and fragile infrastructures.
