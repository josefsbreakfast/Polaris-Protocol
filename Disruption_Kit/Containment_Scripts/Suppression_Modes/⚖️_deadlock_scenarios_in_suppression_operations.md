*Mapping institutional behaviours when disclosure is blocked, partial, or hostile*

---

## 1. Full refusal  
- Claim no data held.  
- **Risks:** unchecked suppression, impunity.  
- **Leverage:** FOI/SAR chasers, non-response logs, whistleblower intake.  

---

## 2. Partial disclosure  
- Admit holdings but curate releases.  
- **Risks:** false impression of transparency, distraction.  
- **Leverage:** cross-compare partials, triangulate with testimony, expose omissions.  

---

## 3. Hostile disclosure  
- Data weaponised via leaks, smears, timing.  
- **Risks:** survivor discrediting, narrative hijack.  
- **Leverage:** prove manipulation, pattern hostile timing, pre-anchor survivor testimony.  

---

## Pattern  
Deadlock isn’t technical but political: refusal, partials, and hostile spins all sustain stalemate.
