# 🐪 Trojan Horse — Benign Masks for Malignancies  

**First created:** 2025-09-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  
*How containment language disguises racial hierarchy, suppression, and malignancy under appearances of neutrality or reasonableness.*  

---

## 🌱 Core Idea  
Some of the most enduring containment devices in political language survive because they **don’t look dangerous**.  
- **Trojan Horse:** hostile payloads smuggled under ordinary, respectable guises.  
- **Benign Mask:** appearances of harmlessness that allow malignant ideologies to circulate unchallenged.  

---

## 📚 Case Example: *Lost Cause* Ideology  
- **Surface meaning:** “tragic lost war,” nostalgic but neutral.  
- **Hidden load:** defence of slavery, white supremacy, and segregation.  
- **Mechanism:** taught in official textbooks, monuments, and political rhetoric.  
- **Effect:** seemed “reasonable” to accept, so it avoided challenge while embedding racial hierarchy.  

---

## 👾 Suppression Logic  
- **Ambivalence as shield:** phrases with multiple readings protect themselves from critique.  
- **Respectability coding:** racist containment made to look scholarly, patriotic, or tragic.  
- **Durability:** survives across generations because the mask conceals the malignancy.
