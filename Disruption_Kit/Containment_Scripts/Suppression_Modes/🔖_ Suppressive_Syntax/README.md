# 🔖 Suppressive Syntax  
**First created:** 2025-09-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  
*Sub-cluster of Suppression Modes focused on linguistic containment devices — euphemisms, ambivalent phrases, and “reasonable” framings that mask malignancy*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  
**Suppressive syntax** captures the ways language itself operates as containment:  
- **Euphemism** — softening brutality into palatable phrasing.  
- **Ambivalence / polysemy** — phrases that carry two readings, one “benign,” one malign.  
- **Respectability coding** — making racism or hierarchy sound “reasonable.”  
- **Trojan Horses** — hostile ideologies smuggled under neutral-seeming labels.  

This cluster documents case studies where words, frames, and rhetorical devices perform suppression just as effectively as laws or force.

- [🧠 Psychological_Containment](../🧠_psychological_containment) — compliance through delay and soft language  
- [🪆 Narrative_Interference](../🪆_narrative_interference) — semantic drift, clone tones, and cultural control

*🔖 Suppressive Syntax* is a sub-cluster of **Suppression Modes** in the Polaris Protocol.  
It archives containment language — the small phrasings and rhetorical tricks that give malignancy a benign appearance.
