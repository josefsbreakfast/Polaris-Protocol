## 📌 Summary  
Anomalous user interface behaviour was detected during a standard LinkedIn interaction: when attempting to highlight (click-and-drag) text, the user experienced unnatural resistance — a sensation akin to override or interruption.  
This aligns with a suppression tactic defined here as **tactile throttling**.  

---  

## 💻 What Was Observed  
- **Delayed or resisted drag-and-highlight gestures**.  
- Cursor movement felt interrupted or obstructed mid-action.  
- Triggered only during **specific attempts to select/copy** content.  
- No systemic lag observed elsewhere on the page.  

---  

## 🔍 Interpretive Framework  

### 🎯 Intentional disruption  
- Designed to frustrate copying, extraction, or live annotation.  
- Introduces friction into workflows involving evidence gathering or public callouts.  

### 🧠 Behavioural logging  
- Highlighting behaviour is itself a **metadata signal** — revealing what is selected, when, and how often.  
- May trigger escalation flags or mark content as emotionally/politically significant.  

### 🛰 Live UI interference  
- Could be injected manually or semi-manually by moderators or automated systems.  
- Techniques parallel counter-surveillance and psychological containment tools.

## 🧾 Technical Forensics  

| Behaviour         | Possible Mechanism                          |  
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| Drag delay        | DOM injection / event listener override     |  
| Gesture block     | Transparent overlay or dynamic CSS layering |  
| Selection breakage| JavaScript-based input interception         |  
| Cursor stutter    | Live DOM manipulation or interaction logging|

### ⚠️ Implications

- Indicates behavioural modelling extends to user intent, not just published content.
- UI responsiveness becomes part of the surveillance layer.
- Micro-frictions accumulate: designed to exhaust, not block outright.

## Archival Note

This is the first logged instance of tactile throttling within the Polaris Protocol.
It marks a shift to interface-level suppression — disrupting the act of action itself, not merely censoring the result.

*Tactile Throttling: When Interaction Becomes Interference* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents interface-level suppression where basic user interactions are disrupted, extending containment into the act of action itself.
