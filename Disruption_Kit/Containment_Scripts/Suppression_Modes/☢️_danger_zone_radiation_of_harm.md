# ☢️ Danger Zone & Radiation of Harm
**First created:** 2025-09-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-10  
*Mapping the radiation of harm once systems fail.*

## ✦ Concept  
The **Danger Zone** is the critical point where harm is no longer isolated. It radiates outward: slips, glitches, and overlooked warnings escalate into systemic failures.  

- **Harm Zone**: Immediate site of damage (the accident, the ignored logbook entry).  
- **Radiation of Harm**: Secondary waves — misinformation, accountability deflection, survivor discrediting.  

## ✦ Survivor Insight  
> “It’s not just the slip or the glitch. It’s the culture that let it slide. The same people who ignore trip hazards are the ones who miss way bigger failures. That’s the Danger Zone: where negligence becomes radiation.”  

The language refuses euphemism: not “hot seat,” not “incident log.” It is **the Danger Zone**.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Danger Zone & Radiation of Harm* is a diagnostic map within the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces how localized negligence escalates into systemic radiations of harm.
