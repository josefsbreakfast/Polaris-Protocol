*Containment pattern where harms are acknowledged but not acted upon*

---

## Definition  
A state or institution acknowledges that harm or misconduct is known, yet deliberately withholds corrective action. The survivor is left in a suspended state: neither fully dismissed nor protected.  

## Core Dynamics  
- **Acknowledgment without remedy** → authorities concede awareness but stall on practical steps.  
- **Visibility as pressure** → signals are sent (“we are watching,” “we are aware”) but no substantive support follows.  
- **Attrition strategy** → the survivor must repeatedly re-assert their legitimacy, draining energy.  
- **Normalisation of inaction** → harm becomes the background condition, reframed as “nuisance” rather than systemic failure.  

## Effects on Survivors  
- Creates a sense of **permanent limbo** — suspended between validation and abandonment.  
- Reinforces hypervigilance: knowing the state sees but refuses to act.  
- Denies closure, keeping coercive control active through bureaucratic delay.  

## Why It Matters in Polaris  
- This pattern is not neutral — it is an active containment method.  
- It maintains power asymmetry by recognising testimony while ensuring resolution never materialises.  
- Naming it makes clear: *“Recognition Without Resolution is a form of governance violence.”*

*Recognition Without Resolution* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how institutional acknowledgement can be weaponised as a containment pattern.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
