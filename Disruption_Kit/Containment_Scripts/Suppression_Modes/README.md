# 🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral  

**First created:** 2025-08-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-31

*Analytics as containment: documenting distortions in reach and engagement.*  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  

This node challenges the assumption that analytics reflect truth. Reach, engagement, impressions — these are platform-defined values, not immutable realities.  

Survivors and whistleblowers are structurally minimised even when content is powerful.  

---

## 📊 Forensic metrics  

- Ghost shares vs registered reach  
- Seen-by count vs post-forwarded reports  
- Read/scroll time vs engagement notation

 ┌───────────────────────────────────┐

## 🛠 Tools in play  

- Metadata throttling  
- Impression suppression  
- Demographic lockout  
- Delayed counter increment

## 📎 Typical targets  

- Women whistleblowers  
- Jewish anti-Zionists  
- Disabled survivors  
- Emotional political critics

## 🔁 Disobedience methods  

- Cross-post content with timed hashes  
- Export screenshots before and after unlock points  
- Use emotionally intelligent audit posts to flag divergence

 *Visibility is not a gift. It is fought for. Measured reach is not your real reach.*

## 🏮 Footer  

*Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents distortions in analytics as systemic containment, where visibility measures are manipulated to minimise survivor testimony and political critique.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
