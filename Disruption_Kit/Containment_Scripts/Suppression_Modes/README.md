## 🔎 Purpose  

This directory collates forensic records of **suppression modes**.  
Each entry is a script fragment showing how platforms and institutions modulate visibility, distort perception, and contain survivor testimony.  

*Suppression is not silence. It is signal.*

## 🏮 Footer  

*Containment Scripts – Suppression Modes* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It curates and organises suppression methods into an accessible directory for forensic use, survivor training, and systemic analysis.
