# 🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral  
**First created:** 2025-08-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-17  
*Analytics as containment: documenting distortions in reach and engagement*  

---  

## 🎯 Purpose  
To challenge the assumption that analytics reflect truth. Reach, engagement, impressions—these are platform-defined values, not immutable realities. This file documents how survivors and whistleblowers are structurally minimised even when content is powerful.  

---  

## 📊 Forensic Metrics  
- Ghost shares vs registered reach  
- Seen-by count vs post-forwarded reports  
- Read/scroll time vs engagement notation
