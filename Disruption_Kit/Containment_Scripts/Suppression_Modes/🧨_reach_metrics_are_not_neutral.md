# 🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral  
`Polaris Protocol – Containment Scripts Node`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To challenge the assumption that analytics reflect truth. Reach, engagement, impressions—these are platform-defined values, not immutable realities. This file documents how survivors and whistleblowers are structurally minimized even when content is powerful.

---

## 📊 Forensic Metrics

- Ghost shares vs registered reach
- Seen-by count vs post-forwarded reports
- Read/scroll time vs engagement notation

---

## 🛠 Tools in Play

- Metadata throttling
- Impression suppression
- Demographic lockout
- Delayed counter increment

---

## 📎 Typical Targets

- Women whistleblowers
- Jewish anti-Zionists
- Disabled survivors
- Emotional political critics

---

## 🔁 Disobedience Methods

- Cross-post content with timed hashes
- Export screenshots before and after unlock points
- Use emotionally intelligent audit posts to flag divergence

> *Visibility is not a gift. It is fought for. Measured reach is not your real reach.*
