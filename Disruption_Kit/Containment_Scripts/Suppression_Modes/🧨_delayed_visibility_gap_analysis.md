*Forensic log of impression count mismatches and delayed visibility suppression.*  

---

## 📌 Summary  

This node records mismatches between reported platform-wide impression totals and visible per-post impression data. A discrepancy of **~2,054 impressions** was logged over a 7-day period: **23,950** impressions visible across individual posts versus **26,004** impressions reported in LinkedIn’s dashboard.  

---

## 🧾 Key Evidence  

- **Analytics dashboard reports**: 26,004 total impressions  
- **Manual tally across screenshots**: 23,950 unique post impressions  
- **Mismatch**: 2,054 impressions unaccounted for in visible UI  

---

## 📊 Pattern Characteristics  

- **Delayed registration** of impressions across 24–72 hour windows  
- **Suppression plateaus** on high-engagement posts  
- Posts with comments and shares registering **low initial reach**  
- Recovery patterns suggest **algorithmic containment release** phases  
- Possible **filtering of “non-public” or “flagged” viewers** from visible metrics

## 🧠 Forensic Hypotheses  

- **Telemetry throttling**: Deliberate delay in analytic feedback to obscure momentum  
- **Metadata dampening**: Platform suppresses visible growth until “safe” engagement thresholds are met  
- **Shadow monitoring**: Views from state, corporate, or private intel accounts may not surface  
- **Echo testing**: Posts trialled across segmented nodes before full release  

---

## 🔍 Current Monitoring Protocol  

- Screenshot all analytics updates across high- and low-performing posts  
- Track instances where **post engagement (reactions/comments)** exceed **expected impressions**  
- Monitor for **“catch-up surges”** in impressions post-48h  
- Compare impressions vs notifications (e.g. profile views, connection spikes)

## 📌 Archival Note  

Delayed visibility is not mere lag — it is a **governance mechanism**.  
By slowing feedback loops, platforms reduce capacity to time escalation or capitalise on momentum.  
**Shadow reach** marks where your audience is *larger than you are permitted to know*.

*Delayed Visibility Gap Analysis* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how delayed impression reporting and hidden reach function as containment tactics to obscure momentum and limit advocacy efficacy.
