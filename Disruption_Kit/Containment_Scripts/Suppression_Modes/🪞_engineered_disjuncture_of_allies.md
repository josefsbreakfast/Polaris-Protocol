# 🪞 Engineered Disjuncture of Allies  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*How survivors are structurally fragmented so potential allies never fully overlap*  

---

## Context  

Survivors of surveillance and political policing often appear to have “natural allies,” but closer inspection shows their experiences are deliberately disjunct:  

- **Spy Cops survivors** → women who experienced relationships with undercover officers; adjacent but not the same trajectory.  
- **Undercover Policing Inquiry disclosures** → partial disclosures made public, but limited group recognition excludes others.  
- **Public figures (e.g. Tariq Ali)** → resonant interviews and reflections, but not lived overlap.  
- **Jewish women** → lack of visible survivor testimony; unclear prevalence, leading to deep isolation.  
- **Friends under surveillance** → some passive, some active, but no shared contour of experience.  
- **Prominent whistleblowers (e.g. Edward Snowden)** → disclosure displaced into authored books rather than lived testimony.

## Pattern  

- **Adjacent but non-overlapping**: Experiences placed close enough to hint at connection, but never aligning fully.  
- **Categorical isolation**: Survivors sorted into separate groups or inquiries, making solidarity difficult.  
- **Silence reinforcement**: Without overlap, each testimony is cast as singular, overly complex, or personal grievance.  
- **Disclosure deferral**: Survivors who do speak often funnel their story into authored works, which preserves distance.

## Notes  

This disjuncture is not accidental. It functions as a containment script:  
- Prevents survivor communities from forming coherent collectives.  
- Ensures each survivor feels alone in narrative risk.  
- Reinforces the sense that “there is no right place” to speak about what happened.

*Engineered Disjuncture of Allies* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how structural fragmentation ensures survivor testimonies remain isolated, preventing solidarity from forming.
