## 📋 Diagnostic Table  

| **Undermining Script** | **Function / Intended Effect** | **Counter-Script** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| “You’re working too hard.” / “Trying too hard.” | Discredits effort + accuracy; frames competence as inauthentic or suspect. | “Detail is survival. Accuracy is how truth holds.” |
| “It’s too polished / too good / too accurate.” | Suggests truth should be flawed; perfection = suspicious. | “Coherence doesn’t cancel lived experience — it strengthens it.” |
| “You don’t need to say XYZ.” | Suppresses key detail; redirects away from uncomfortable evidence. | “If they’re telling me not to say it, that’s proof it matters.” |
| “Not the right person to talk on this subject.” | Delegitimises testimony; enforces gatekeeping of voice. | “I’m the right person — because it happened to me.” |
| “Are you sure you remember right?” | Plants doubt in memory; weakens authority of lived experience. | “Yes. My memory may carry scars, but it’s mine — and the record backs it.” |
| “Someone else can explain it better.” | Removes ownership of narrative; displaces survivor expertise. | “No one can explain my experience better than I can.” |
| “People might get the wrong idea if you share.” | Fear appeal; pressures silence to avoid imagined misinterpretation. | “If people misunderstand, that’s their projection — not a reason for me to stay silent.” |
| “Real survivors wouldn’t say it like that.” | Polices authenticity; invalidates testimony style or delivery. | “There’s no one script for survival. My way of saying it is proof I’m real.” |
| “This sounds obsessive / too much detail.” | Undermines forensic precision; reframes evidence-gathering as pathology. | “Detail is evidence. Evidence is not obsession.” |
| “Maybe save that for later / another space.” | Delays or derails disclosure; containment via endless deferral. | “Later is never guaranteed. I’m saying it now.” |

## 🌀 Containment Loop Diagram (conceptual)  

    [Too messy / incoherent] → [Too polished / accurate] →  
    [Wrong person to speak] → [Too much detail / obsessive] →  
    [Better said later / elsewhere] → [Not safe to say at all] →  
    (back to start)


**Polaris Counters = Breakpoints:**  
At each loop junction, the survivor flips the script:  
- **Detail = survival**  
- **Coherence = strength**  
- **Lived experience = authority**  
- **Detail = evidence**  
- **Now = valid**  
- **Voice = sovereign**

## 📖 Explainer  

Undermining scripts are **containment devices**.  
They create a **no-win circle** where *whatever you say* can be disqualified:  

- Messy testimony → *“too incoherent.”*  
- Clear testimony → *“too polished.”*  
- Survivor speaks → *“wrong person.”*  
- Evidence brought → *“obsessive.”*  
- Delayed attempt → *“not the right time/place.”*  

This is deliberate **discursive sabotage**. It aims to:  
1. **Discredit** survivor testimony.  
2. **Delay** disclosure until it loses impact.  
3. **Displace** authority from the witness to an “approved” voice.  

### Polaris Response  

- **Name the script.** Recognise it as tactic, not truth.  
- **Flip the logic.** What’s attacked (detail, accuracy, timing) is exactly why it’s valid.  
- **Break the loop.** Refuse the circle of *damned if you do, damned if you don’t*.

📌 **Bottom line:** *Your voice is valid in any register — messy, precise, painful, calm, now or later.*  
The scripts are designed to erase you; Polaris flips them into proof you need to be heard.

*☄️ Undermining Scripts* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how discursive sabotage works, and equips survivors with counter-scripts to break containment.
