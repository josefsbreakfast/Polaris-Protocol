# 🕵️ Collapse Between Harassment and Surveillance  
**First created:** 2025-08-31 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-13  
*Forensic note on how harassment reports are dismissed under surveillance framings*  

---

## ✦ The Collapse  
- Survivor reports of **direct harassment** are reframed as “expected surveillance.”  
- This erases the line between *targeted harm* and *institutional monitoring*.  
- As a result, harassment is treated as background noise rather than actionable violence.  
- Clear potential risk of harm by non-address.

---

## ✦ Consequences  
- **No investigation:** perpetrators of harassment are left unchallenged.  
- **No protection:** survivors receive no safeguarding response.  
- **Normalisation:** harassment becomes accepted as a structural feature.  
- **Cruelty:** survivors are forced to live inside suspicion without clarity.  

---

## ✦ Forensic Note  
The refusal to distinguish harassment from surveillance is itself a containment strategy.  
By collapsing categories, institutions deny accountability while ensuring survivors remain under pressure.

*Collapse Between Harassment and Surveillance* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how harms are misframed as monitoring, stripping survivors of both recognition and protection.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
