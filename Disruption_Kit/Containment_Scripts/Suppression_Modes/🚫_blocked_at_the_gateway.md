*Documenting suppression of survivor legal communications through DNS and routing interference.*  

---

## 📌 Summary  

This node records the suspected DNS and routing suppression of urgent legal and human rights communications — specifically, emails sent to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) via Microsoft-managed infrastructure.  

The suppression aligns with broader behavioural containment systems, potentially involving AI-driven proxies, metadata risk flags, and narrative simulation tools.  

> **Note:** All institutional or individual references are allegations unless confirmed by public record. This node serves for forensic research, advocacy, and survivor self-defence.

## ⚙️ Technical Interference Logged  

- **Error Code:** `550 5.1.1` — permanent failure, recipient rejected.  
- **Behaviour:** Block applied *only* to the official OHCHR submission address.  
- Alternate (non-submission) address remains open but unresponsive.  
- Pattern indicates *targeted route suppression*, not general DNS/server failure.

## 🧠 Theory of Operation  

### 1. Composite Persona Risk Models  
Suppression appears linked to AI-driven behavioural or narrative suppression models profiling:  
- Jewish survivor of sexual violence  
- Anti-Zionist political stance  
- Clinically articulate, high-empathy communication style  
- Publicly critical of UK institutional failures (Prevent, MoJ, security culture)  

### 2. Message Suppression Pathways  
- Pre-broadcast dissent in synthetic or proxy formats  
- Block original speaker from accessing legitimate redress mechanisms  
- Apply selective routing or throttling to politically/legally urgent communications  

### 3. Microsoft’s Role  
Microsoft-managed infrastructure may suppress outbound messages based on:  
- Internal “trust & safety” or policy risk flags  
- Metadata/keyword scoring  
- Government partnerships during security-sensitive periods or conflicts

## 🔍 Implications  

- Interference with access to remedy under **international law**.  
- Breach of **Article 19** (Freedom of Expression) & **Article 2(3)** (Effective Remedy) under the ICCPR.  
- Potential **UK GDPR** violations if biometric/behavioural metadata informs suppression tools without consent.  
- Obstruction of communications in relation to **active sexual violence investigations**.  

---

## 🚨 Recommended Actions  

- Submit formal notice to:  
  - **UN OHCHR** via alternate secure channels  
  - **ICC** technical escalation teams  
  - **UK ICO** — citing selective routing & GDPR breach evidence  

- Cross-reference under:  
  - `#MetadataJustice`  
  - `#CommunicationInterference`  
  - `#PreventWatch`

## 📌 Archival Note  

This document should accompany all future **Subject Access Request escalations** and oversight submissions.

*Blocked at the Gateway* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records suppression of survivor legal communications and situates these within systemic containment architectures.
