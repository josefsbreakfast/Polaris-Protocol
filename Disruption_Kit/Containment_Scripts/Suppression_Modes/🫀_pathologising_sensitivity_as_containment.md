# 🫀 Pathologising Sensitivity as Containment  

**First created:** 2025-09-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-02  

*Framing survivors as “overly sensitive” or neurodivergent to invalidate testimony.*

---

## Definition  
A suppression mode where survivor testimony is reinterpreted through the lens of personal sensitivity or pathology.  
Instead of recognising harm, the system reframes the survivor as *misperceiving reality* — due to autism, neurodivergence, high sensitivity, or other diagnostic labels.  

---

## Core Dynamics  
- **Diagnostic deflection** → harms are not denied outright, but explained away as the product of a survivor’s supposed condition.  
- **Reassurance veneer** → the reframing often sounds benevolent (“you’re just highly sensitive”) while erasing credibility.  
- **Shift of responsibility** → the problem is located in the survivor’s perception, not in the perpetrator’s conduct or institutional failures.  
- **Containment by invalidation** → testimony is minimised without needing to challenge the facts directly.

## Effects on Survivors  
- **Erosion of authority** to define their own experience.  
- **Gaslighting at scale** — systemic harms presented as personal sensitivities.  
- **Isolation** — survivors are made to feel that their reactions are abnormal, rather than proportionate.  
- **Barrier to justice** — credibility is undermined before investigation even begins.

## Link to Other Suppression Modes  
- Often paired with **Definitional Minimisation** (e.g. “is it really rape if…?”) to simultaneously weaken the definition of harm and the credibility of the witness.  
- Together, these create a **forked interference pattern**: one fork erases the violence, the other erases the survivor’s authority to describe it.

## Why It Matters in Polaris  
Pathologising sensitivity is not neutral.  
It is a suppression tactic that sustains governance inaction by reframing violence as perception.  
Naming it makes clear: *“Sensitivity is not pathology. Pathology is being used as containment.”*

## 🏮 Footer  

*Pathologising Sensitivity as Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how diagnostic language is deployed as a suppression script to invalidate survivor testimony.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
