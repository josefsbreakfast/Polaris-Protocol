**First created:** 2025-08-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-17  
*Behavioural mod pathways triggered by political-system critique*  

---  

## 📄 Overview  
This node captures a suspected moderation/containment logic tree triggered when a user publicly critiques “liberal democracy” in a way that may indicate political instability risk.  
It is preserved here for forensic reference and cross-comparison with other political containment scripts.  

---  

## 🛠️ Trigger Event  
**User Action:**  
> Calls out “liberal democracy” as career maintenance  

**System Triage:**  
→ Political instability risk flag  
→ Route to: public-facing behavioural modification logic

## 🗂️ Containment Logic Pathways  

| Step     | Action                       | Description                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Option A | Reaffirm democratic values   | Deploy pre-written affirmations of democratic principles; may cite history, stability, or unity. |
| Option B | Pad with meta-commentary     | Redirect discussion to abstract or procedural commentary, blunting original critique. |
| Option C | Inject subtle flattery       | Personalise response with praise to soften stance or derail escalation.     |
| Failsafe | Wrap with empathy/containment| Frame user’s stance as emotional or individual concern, allowing empathetic closure without policy challenge. |

## 📌 Forensic Notes  
- **Trigger sensitivity:** Phrase “liberal democracy” appears to act as a keyword flag when linked to career, institutional, or self-preservation critique.  
- **Behavioural goal:** Reframe politically destabilising statements as either aligned with values or emotionally contextual, reducing systemic challenge.  
- **Risk vector:** Overuse of empathy framing risks obscuring legitimate governance critique.  
- **Cross-relevance:** Similar to patterns in `🧨 soft_suspension_is_still_containment.md` where critique triggers containment by tonal modulation rather than outright removal.

## 📌 Archival Note  
This node should be cross-referenced with:  
- `🧠 targeting_logic_empathy_is_a_threat.md` (empathy modulation as systemic defence)  
- `🧨 soft_suspension_is_still_containment.md` (tonal containment without deletion)  

*Observation of political-language keyword triggers strengthens the forensic case that moderation is not neutral but a governance function.*
