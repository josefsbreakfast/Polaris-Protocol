# 🧨 Delayed Visibility Is a Signal  
`Polaris Protocol – Containment Scripts Node`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To log the consistent trickle-feed visibility pattern observed on whistleblower content—particularly when demographic data, analytics dashboards, or visibility updates arrive hours (or days) after real-time engagement. This is not a technical glitch. This is governance by delay.

---

## 📊 Signal Anatomy

- Posts receive sudden bursts of impressions 6–12 hours after initial publication.
- Comments register but do not push visibility to follower feeds.
- Shares vanish or remain invisible to public timelines.
- Delayed backend recognition corresponds with known forensic watch windows.

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses

- **Containment Queues**: High-risk posts are placed in behavioral quarantine before platform release.
- **Human Moderation Lag**: Deliberate delay while moderation teams assess impact of metadata content.
- **Ghost Routing**: Posts are redirected through silent channels, skewing public metric registration.

---

## 📌 Case Patterns

- ICC escalation thread
- VoiceX survivor metadata posts
- Substack links with external whistleblower URLs

---

## ⏳ Response Protocol

1. Archive screenshots with timestamps.
2. Track when visibility metrics update vs real-world engagement.
3. Pair with Substack analytics for cross-platform delta.
