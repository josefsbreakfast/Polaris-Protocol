# ⚖️ Fixivist Chain of Command  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-12  
*Exploring how activist energy (“fix it now”) intersects with institutional command structures*

---

## Fixivist logic  
- **Urgency:** act quickly, repair harm, prevent further damage.  
- **Values:** transparency, speed, survivor-centred action.  
- **Risks:** bypassing safeguards, overexposure, vulnerability to claims of irregularity.  

---

## Chain of command logic  
- **Authority:** mandate, oversight, procedural legitimacy.  
- **Values:** compliance, stability, precedent.  
- **Risks:** inertia, denial, capture, deflection.  

---

## The tension  
- Fixivists push for urgent repair.  
- Chain of command slows or blocks action.  
- Both are needed: urgency without legitimacy risks collapse, legitimacy without urgency risks paralysis.

*Fixivist Chain of Command* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records the structural tension between urgent survivor-led repair and formal institutional processes.
