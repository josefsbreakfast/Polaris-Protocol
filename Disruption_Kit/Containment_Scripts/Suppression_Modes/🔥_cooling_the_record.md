# 🔥 Cooling the Record

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05

*How affect, detail, and tone are stripped from survivor testimony to make it “safe” for systems.*  

---

## Context  

Survivor testimony often arrives with **heat**: anger, grief, humour, precision, naming.  
These elements make testimony vivid, human, and potentially contagious.  
They are also the elements most likely to be punished if left visible.  

---

## Suppression Pattern  

- **Anger** → reframed as instability (“irrational,” “hysterical,” “aggressive”).  
- **Grief + vulnerability** → reframed as oversharing or weakness; used to delegitimise credibility.  
- **Detail** → too much = “rambling nonsense,” too little = “not credible.” Either way punished.  
- **Connections + naming** → triggers legal risk, reputational attack, or visibility throttling.  
- **Humour / satire** → punished as “disrespectful” or “unprofessional,” despite being a coping and exposing tool.  

---

## Mechanism  

Systems impose a **cooling process**:  
- Affect is stripped.  
- Statements are flattened into bureaucratic tone.  
- Narrative is reduced to “factual, admissible, stripped of heat.”  

The resulting record is safe for institutions because it cannot spark recognition or solidarity.  

---

## Notes  

- Cooling the record is not neutral editing — it is a **containment script**.  
- Survivors are coerced into self-cooling to remain legible, sacrificing emotional truth for admissibility.  
- Heat, if preserved, is punished through reputational harm, institutional escalation, or suppression algorithms.

*Cooling the Record* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how survivor testimony is stripped of affect to render it inert, preventing it from generating recognition or contagion.
