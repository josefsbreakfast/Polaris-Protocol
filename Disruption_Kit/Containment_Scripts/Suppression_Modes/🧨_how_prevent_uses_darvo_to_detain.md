## 📌 Summary  
PREVENT does not only operate as a referral scheme. It functions as a discursive inversion machine. Through DARVO — **Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim & Offender** — Prevent recasts survivors, critics, and dissidents as unstable “risks.” This inversion provides justification for coercive interventions, including **psychiatric detention** under the Mental Health Act.

## 🧩 The DARVO Sequence in Prevent  

### **1. Deny**  
- “We’re not monitoring you under Prevent.”  
- “This isn’t about politics or counterterrorism — it’s just safeguarding.”  
- **Effect:** removes transparency, blocks due process.  

### **2. Attack**  
- “You’re unstable / paranoid / radicalised.”  
- Testimony is reduced to symptom; critique becomes pathology.  
- **Effect:** undermines credibility before courts, oversight, or peers.  

### **3. Reverse Victim & Offender**  
- “We’re protecting you.”  
- “You are the risk we have to contain.”  
- **Effect:** State becomes carer, survivor becomes offender.

## ⚖️ Operational Outcomes  

- **Sectioning under the Mental Health Act**  
  - Detention framed as “healthcare” while serving Prevent’s containment function.  

- **Medical Chaperoning**  
  - Healthcare encounters are “escorted” by safeguarding overlays.  

- **Narrative Erasure**  
  - Political speech or testimony is reclassified as instability.

## 🗂️ Sidebar: MUU Explained  

**MUU = Mixed, Unstable, or Unclear Concern**  

- **What it is:** A Prevent catch-all category, used when a person doesn’t fit Islamist or far-right labels but is still considered “a concern.”  
- **How it works:**  
  - **Mixed:** Elements of different ideological markers (e.g. Palestine + mental health).  
  - **Unstable:** Where behaviour is seen as erratic, emotional, or hard to categorise.  
  - **Unclear:** Where no ideological markers are present, but officials still decide monitoring is warranted.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - Creates a **dumping ground for ambiguity**.  
  - Enables **open-ended surveillance** without thresholds of criminality.  
  - Overlaps directly with psychiatric framings of instability — making sectioning a convenient “solution.”

## 🛡️ Counter-Protocol  

- **Name the frame:** State explicitly “this is Prevent/MUU logic using DARVO.”  
- **Rights Anchoring:**  
  - “Which section am I under?”  
  - “Please show me the signed paperwork.”  
  - “I want my solicitor contacted immediately.”  
- **Documentation:** Log every denial, attack, and reversal — DARVO collapses under evidence.  
- **Witness Networks:** Share records with allies to prevent isolation.

## 🧭 Polaris Conclusion  
Prevent operates through **DARVO as statecraft**: denying its presence, attacking the subject, reversing victim/offender roles, and then laundering containment through MUU categorisation and psychiatric detention. This is not safeguarding. It is **governance by inversion.**
