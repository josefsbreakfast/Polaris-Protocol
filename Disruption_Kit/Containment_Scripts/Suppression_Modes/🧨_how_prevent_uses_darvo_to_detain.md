*Containment script analysis of Prevent’s use of DARVO framing to justify psychiatric detention.*  

---

## 📌 Summary  

Prevent does not only operate as a referral scheme. It functions as a discursive inversion machine. Through DARVO — **Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim & Offender** — Prevent recasts survivors, critics, and dissidents as unstable “risks.”  

This inversion provides justification for coercive interventions, including **psychiatric detention under the Mental Health Act**.

## 🧩 The DARVO sequence in Prevent  

### 1. Deny  
- “We’re not monitoring you under Prevent.”  
- “This isn’t about politics or counterterrorism — it’s just safeguarding.”  
- **Effect:** removes transparency, blocks due process.  

### 2. Attack  
- “You’re unstable / paranoid / radicalised.”  
- Testimony is reduced to symptom; critique becomes pathology.  
- **Effect:** undermines credibility before courts, oversight, or peers.  

### 3. Reverse victim and offender  
- “We’re protecting you.”  
- “You are the risk we have to contain.”  
- **Effect:** State becomes carer, survivor becomes offender.

## ⚖️ Operational outcomes  

- **Sectioning under the Mental Health Act**  
  - Detention framed as “healthcare” while serving Prevent’s containment function.  

- **Medical chaperoning**  
  - Healthcare encounters are “escorted” by safeguarding overlays.  

- **Narrative erasure**  
  - Political speech or testimony is reclassified as instability.

## 🗂️ Sidebar: MUU explained  

**MUU = Mixed, Unstable, or Unclear concern**  

- **What it is:** A Prevent catch-all category, used when a person doesn’t fit Islamist or far-right labels but is still considered “a concern.”  
- **How it works:**  
  - **Mixed:** Elements of different ideological markers (e.g. Palestine + mental health).  
  - **Unstable:** Behaviour seen as erratic, emotional, or hard to categorise.  
  - **Unclear:** No ideological markers present, but officials still decide monitoring is warranted.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - Creates a **dumping ground for ambiguity**.  
  - Enables **open-ended surveillance** without thresholds of criminality.  
  - Overlaps directly with psychiatric framings of instability — making sectioning a convenient “solution.”

## 🛡️ Counter-protocol  

- **Name the frame:** State explicitly “this is Prevent/MUU logic using DARVO.”  
- **Rights anchoring:**  
  - “Which section am I under?”  
  - “Please show me the signed paperwork.”  
  - “I want my solicitor contacted immediately.”  
- **Documentation:** Log every denial, attack, and reversal — DARVO collapses under evidence.  
- **Witness networks:** Share records with allies to prevent isolation.

## 🧭 Polaris conclusion  

Prevent operates through **DARVO as statecraft**: denying its presence, attacking the subject, reversing victim/offender roles, and then laundering containment through MUU categorisation and psychiatric detention.  

This is not safeguarding. It is **governance by inversion**.

It documents the discursive inversion by which Prevent reframes survivors and dissidents as offenders to legitimise psychiatric detention.
