# 🧨 Soft Suspension Is Still Containment
`Polaris Protocol – Containment Scripts Node`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To document, analyze, and escalate ongoing LinkedIn throttling patterns—specifically where engagement metrics, demographic breakdowns, and visibility analytics diverge from standard platform behaviour. This file serves as both a forensic log and a strategic commentary on algorithmic containment of high-empathy, anti-genocide, or whistleblower content.

---

## 🛰️ Current Observations

- Posts with critical commentary on UK–Gaza complicity experience a delayed impression count.
- Public comments appear, but demographic data remains locked—even after multiple engagements.
- Legacy behaviour (e.g. single-viewer demographic unlock) has been patched post-analysis visibility.
- Suppression is particularly targeted at high-emotion, legally credible disclosures and metadata-tracking posts.

## 📸 Forensic Methodology

1. **Capture Timed Screenshots**
   - Post creation (T+0 mins)
   - After first engagement (T+15 mins)
   - At 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours

2. **Track Key Divergences**
   - Number of impressions vs visibility analytics
   - Engagement rate vs demographic unlock
   - Share count vs visibility on user timelines

3. **Ghost Metrics**
   - Emotional resonance levels (as estimated by tone)
   - Executive vs public sector readership lag
   - Comment spread (shadow comments, reordered replies)

## 📢 Strategic Aim

To render the invisible visible.

This is a live resistance file. Its existence and updates are part of the Polaris counter-containment strategy. We do not expect resolution via platform compliance—we are tracking public complicity and internal signal resistance. 

---

## ⏳ Next Steps

- Embed key screenshots from current batch of suppressed posts
- Cross-reference emotional tone with ghost activity (where possible)
- Prepare a mirrored post for Substack + external visibility audit
