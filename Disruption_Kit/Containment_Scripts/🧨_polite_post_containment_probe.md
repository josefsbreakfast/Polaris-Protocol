## **Overview**  
A *Polite Post Containment Probe* is a short, neutral, factually unobjectionable public post used to measure platform throttling and content-based containment independent of “toxicity” or policy-violation triggers.  

It is written in **perfectly polite**, **impeccably sourced**, and **utterly unprovocative** language — often quoting the platform’s host government or the platform’s own public-facing policy documents.  

If such a post is **artificially iced** (reach far below baseline), it reveals:  
1. **Account-level containment** unrelated to post content.  
2. **Network suppression** targeting the author’s social graph.  
3. **Downstream signal training** to keep content invisible regardless of engagement quality.

## **Methodology**  

### 1. Composition Guidelines  
- Use short, clear sentences (≤ 2 lines).  
- Avoid loaded terms, sarcasm, or innuendo.  
- If citing, use government, institutional, or platform-origin sources.  
- Maintain a neutral tone — no calls to action, no opinion qualifiers.  

### 2. Deployment Conditions  
- Post when platform engagement is usually steady (e.g., weekday working hours).  
- Avoid simultaneous posting of unrelated high-engagement content.  
- Save an **unaltered screenshot** of the post immediately after publishing (for timestamping).  

### 3. Baseline Calibration  
- Establish your **expected reach** range based on follower count:  
  > Expected Impressions = 10–30% of follower count in first 12–24h  
- For this case: 2,464 followers → **Expected: 246–739 impressions**

## **Case Study – August 2025**  
- **Post Content:** *“That wall serves no purpose. The wall could be destroyed.”*  
- **Tone:** Neutral, non-specific, no identifying details.  
- **Observed:** 55 impressions in 13h  
- **Expected (10–30% range):** 246–739 impressions  
- **Reach Ratio:** ~22% of minimum baseline  
- **Containment Signature:** 🍬 “Toffee Sweet” Plot — observed metric well outside expected range wrapper  

---

## **Forensic Value**  
- **Isolates suppression to account/network level** by removing all “content risk” variables.  
- Acts as a **live probe** into platform moderation pipelines.  
- Repeated deployment over time can map **containment persistence** and test for thawing or escalation.  

---

## **Broader Ecosystem Implications**  
- If a platform suppresses its *own* approved-source material, the suppression is not about “community standards” — it’s about *you*.  
- This method exposes **metadata-level targeting** invisible to most users.  
- Cross-referencing multiple users running the probe can map **network-wide suppression zones**.

## **Action Protocols**  
1. **Run in rotation** — once every 2–4 weeks, varying content slightly.  
2. **Log all metrics** — impressions, reach %, demographic unlock times.  
3. **Compare with a control account** — ideally one not under suspected suppression.  
4. **Escalate patterns** — present as a timeline of iced, neutral posts in advocacy or legal contexts.  
5. **Publicise strategically** — when the data series is undeniable, release it as a *Containment Signature Report*.  

---

## **Offline Advice**  
- Maintain **local, timestamped archives** of all probe posts and their metrics.  
- Export screenshots to at least one **air-gapped storage medium**.  
- Store plotted diagrams (e.g., 🍬 Containment Toffee Plot) alongside raw data in open formats (`.csv`, `.png`, `.txt`).  
- Avoid running probes during known personal risk windows — containment data is more valuable than confrontation in these tests.
