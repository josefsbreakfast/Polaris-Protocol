# 🧨 Containment Scripts

**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-02

*Forensic archive of suppression tactics and survivor countermeasures.*

---

## 📌 Purpose  
**Containment Scripts** document the operational methods used to suppress survivor and whistleblower visibility — and the countermeasures that flip these tactics back on their operators.  

Think of this folder as a **field playbook**:  
- **Suppression Modes** → how institutions and platforms distort reach, perception, or communication.  
- **Counter Nudges** → the breach tactics we deploy in response.  

Each entry cross-references **Field Logs** for live case studies.

## 📂 Suppression Modes  

- [🧨 Comment Order Is a Governance Layer](./Suppression_Modes/🧨_comment_order_is_a_governance_layer.md)  
  *Comment sequencing used to distort tone and perceived support.*  

- [🧨 Delayed Visibility Is a Signal](./Suppression_Modes/🧨_delayed_visibility_is_a_signal.md)  
  *Trickle-feed reach: engagement registers late to mute impact.*  

- [🧨 Delayed Visibility Gap Analysis](./Suppression_Modes/🧨_delayed_visibility_gap_analysis.md)  
  *Numerical mismatches between dashboard totals and per-post impressions.*  

- [🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral](./Suppression_Modes/🧨_reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md)  
  *Analytics manipulated to undercount survivor-led content.*  

- [🖱️ Tactile Throttling](./Suppression_Modes/🖱️_tactile_throttling_when_interaction_becomes_interference.md)  
  *UX friction — disappearing buttons, lag, false inputs — blocking interaction.*

- [🚫 Blocked at the Gateway](./Suppression_Modes/🚫_blocked_at_the_gateway.md)  
  *DNS, routing, and recipient-level suppression (e.g. UN/OHCHR).*  

- [🗳️ "Liberal Democracy!" Response Logic](./Suppression_Modes/🗳️_liberal_democracy_response_logic.md)  
  *Keyword-triggered moderation pathways when critiquing political systems.*

- [🌀 Recognition Without Resolution](./🌀_recognition_without_resolution.md)  
  *Acknowledgement of harm used as suppression when resolution is withheld.

- [🫀 Pathologising Sensitivity as Containment](./🫀_pathologising_sensitivity_as_containment.md)  
  *Framing survivors as “overly sensitive” or neurodivergent to invalidate testimony.*

## 📂 Counter Nudges  

- [🧨 Nudgers Get Nudged](./Counter_Nudges/🧨_nudgers_get_nudged.md)  
  *Turning behavioural science back on its operators — institutional + individual tactics.*  

- [🧨 Polite Post Containment Probe](./Counter_Nudges/🧨_polite_post_containment_probe.md)  
  *Neutral, fact-based probes to test suppression + account-level throttling.*  

- [♨️ Slow Burn Tactics](./Counter_Nudges/♨️_slow_burn_tactics.md)  
  *Attritional strategies to wear down containment without triggering escalation.*  

- [🍬 Containment Toffee Plot (2025-08-12)](./Counter_Nudges/🍬_containment_toffee_plot_2025-08-12_BR_compact.png)  
  *Diagram showing expected vs observed reach under suppression.*  

- [🔮 Seance Protocol](./Counter_Nudges/🔮_seance_protocol.md)  
  *Experimental script for contacting suppressed content traces in platform archives.*  

- [🛠️ Practical Resilience Nodes](./Counter_Nudges/🛠️_practical_resilience_nodes.md)  
  *Seed collection of survivor-led strategies for conserving energy and redistributing labour under containment.*  

---

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Suppression Modes** → record *their playbook*.  
- **Counter Nudges** → record *ours*.  
- Each entry cross-references **Field Logs** for real-world case evidence (e.g. ICC tag thread, OHCHR block).

*Containment Scripts* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It curates suppression tactics and countermeasures into a working playbook for survivors and forensic investigators.

> - [Field Logs](../Field_Logs) — dated forensic evidence of suppression in practice  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
