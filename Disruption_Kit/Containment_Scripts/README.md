## 📌 Overview  
**Containment Scripts** document the tactical methods platforms and institutions use to throttle, distort, or redirect survivor and whistleblower visibility.  
These are live operational patterns, tracked for forensic evidence and countermeasure design.

### [`🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral`](./🧨_reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md)  
Challenges the assumption that analytics reflect reality; documents how reach is structurally minimised for targeted voices.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Comment Order** covers conversational distortion, often paired with **Delayed Visibility**’s throttling patterns.  
- **Reach Metrics** records how both distortions feed into skewed analytics.  
- All three link outward to **Big Picture Protocols** for systemic context.
