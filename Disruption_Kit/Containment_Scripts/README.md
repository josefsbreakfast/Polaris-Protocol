**Location:** `Disruption_Kit/Containment_Scripts`  
_Last updated: 2025-08-11_

## 📌 Overview  
**Containment Scripts** document the tactical methods platforms and institutions use to throttle, distort, or redirect survivor and whistleblower visibility.  
These are live operational patterns, tracked for forensic evidence and countermeasure design.

### [`🧨 Delayed Visibility Is A Signal`](./🧨_delayed_visibility_is_a_signal.md)  
Tracks the trickle-feed visibility pattern on high-risk content, where metrics and reach update long after engagement.

### [`🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral`](./🧨_reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md)  
Challenges the assumption that analytics reflect reality; documents how reach is structurally minimised for targeted voices.

### [`🖱 Tactile Throttling When Interaction Becomes Interference`](./🖱_tactile_throttling_when_interaction_becomes_interference.md)  
UI/UX suppression methods — from deliberate lag to disappearing elements — that prevent or frustrate engagement.  
**Links:** (pending relevant Field Logs)

### [`🚫 Blocked at the Gateway`](./🚫_blocked_at_the_gateway.md)  
Communication suppression targeting DNS, routing, or specific recipient addresses (e.g., OHCHR submission block).

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Comment Order**, **Delayed Visibility**, and **Reach Metrics** form the core visibility suppression trio — each now tied to at least one live case in **Field Logs**.  
- **Tactile Throttling** and **Blocked at the Gateway** log infrastructure-level interference that can connect to future field entries.  
- Reverse linking ensures that when someone reads about a suppression *method*, they can immediately see an example of it in action.
