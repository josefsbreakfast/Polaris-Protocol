## 📌 Purpose  
Containment Scripts document the *operational methods* used to suppress survivor and whistleblower visibility — and the *countermeasures* that flip these tactics back on their operators.  

Think of this folder as a **field playbook**:  
- **Suppression Modes** → the ways institutions and platforms distort reach, perception, or communication.  
- **Counter-Nudges** → the breach tactics we deploy in response.  

Each entry links outward to **Field Logs** for live case studies.

## 📂 Suppression Modes  

- **[`🧨 Comment Order Is A Governance Layer`](./🧨_comment_order_is_a_governance_layer.md)**  
  Comment sequencing used to distort tone and perceived support.  

- **[`🧨 Delayed Visibility Is A Signal`](./🧨_delayed_visibility_is_a_signal.md)**  
  Trickle-feed reach: engagement registers late to mute impact.  

- **[`🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral`](./🧨_reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md)**  
  Analytics manipulated to undercount survivor-led content.  

- **[`🖱 Tactile Throttling`](./🖱_tactile_throttling_when_interaction_becomes_interference.md)**  
  UI/UX friction — disappearing buttons, lag, false inputs — blocking interaction.  

- **[`🚫 Blocked at the Gateway`](./🚫_blocked_at_the_gateway.md)**  
  DNS, routing, and recipient-level message suppression (e.g. UN/OHCHR).

## 📂 Counter-Nudges  

- **[`🧨 Nudgers Get Nudged`](./🧨_nudgers_get_nudged.md)**  
  Turning behavioural science back on its operators — institutional + individual tactics.  

- **[`🧨 Polite Post Containment`](./🧨_polite_post_containment.md)**  
  Deconstructs “civility” framing as a containment method; offers inversion tactics.  

- **[`🔥 Slow Burn Tactics`](./🔥_slow_burn_tactics.md)**  
  Logs attritional containment strategies and survivor counterplay.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Suppression Modes** record *their playbook*.  
- **Counter-Nudges** record *ours*.  
- Each entry links outward into **Field Logs** for real-world evidence (e.g. ICC tag thread, OHCHR submission block).
