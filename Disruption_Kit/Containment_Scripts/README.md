# 🧨 Polaris Protocol – Containment Scripts  
**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-17  
*Disruption Kit Node – Forensic archive of suppression tactics and survivor countermeasures*  

---

## 📌 Purpose  
Containment Scripts document the **operational methods** used to suppress survivor and whistleblower visibility — and the **countermeasures** that flip these tactics back on their operators.  

Think of this folder as a **field playbook**:  
- **Suppression Modes** → how institutions and platforms distort reach, perception, or communication.  
- **Counter Nudges** → the breach tactics we deploy in response.  

Each entry links outward to **Field Logs** for live case studies.

## 📂 Suppression Modes  

- [🖊️ Comment Order Is a Governance Layer](./🖊️_comment_order_is_a_governance_layer.md)  
  *Comment sequencing used to distort tone and perceived support.*  

- [⏳ Delayed Visibility Is a Signal](./⏳_delayed_visibility_is_a_signal.md)  
  *Trickle-feed reach: engagement registers late to mute impact.*  

- [⏳ Delayed Visibility Gap Analysis](./⏳_delayed_visibility_gap_analysis.md)  
  *Numerical mismatches between dashboard totals and per-post impressions.*  

- [📉 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral](./📉_reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md)  
  *Analytics manipulated to undercount survivor-led content.*  

- [🖱️ Tactile Throttling](./🖱️_tactile_throttling_when_interaction_becomes_interference.md)  
  *UX friction — disappearing buttons, lag, false inputs — blocking interaction.*  

- [🚫 Blocked at the Gateway](./🚫_blocked_at_the_gateway.md)  
  *DNS, routing, and recipient-level suppression (e.g. UN/OHCHR).*  

- [📄 "Liberal Democracy!" Response Logic](./📄_liberal_democracy_response_logic.md)  
  *Keyword-triggered moderation pathways when critiquing political systems.*

## 📂 Counter Nudges  

- [🧨 Nudgers Get Nudged](./🧨_nudgers_get_nudged.md)  
  *Turning behavioural science back on its operators — institutional + individual tactics.*  

- [🧨 Polite Post Containment Probe](./🧨_polite_post_containment_probe.md)  
  *Neutral, fact-based probes to test suppression + account-level throttling.*  

- [🔥 Slow Burn Tactics](./🔥_slow_burn_tactics.md)  
  *Attritional strategies to wear down containment without triggering escalation.*  

- [🍬 Containment Toffee Plot (2025-08-12)](./🍬_containment_toffee_plot_2025-08-12_BR_compact.png)  
  *Diagram showing expected vs observed reach under suppression.*  

---

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Suppression Modes** record *their playbook*.  
- **Counter Nudges** record *ours*.  
- Each entry cross-references **Field Logs** for real-world case evidence (e.g. ICC tag thread, OHCHR block).
