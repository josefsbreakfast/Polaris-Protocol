# 🧨 Polaris Protocol – Containment Scripts  
**Location:** `Disruption_Kit/Containment_Scripts`  
_Last updated: 2025-08-11_

## 📌 Overview  
**Containment Scripts** document the tactical methods platforms and institutions use to throttle, distort, or redirect survivor and whistleblower visibility.  
These are live operational patterns, tracked for forensic evidence and countermeasure design.

### [`🧨 Comment Order Is A Governance Layer`](./🧨_comment_order_is_a_governance_layer.md)  
Logs manipulation of comment sequencing to distort tone and perceived support.

### [`🧨 Delayed Visibility Is A Signal`](./🧨_delayed_visibility_is_a_signal.md)  
Tracks the trickle-feed visibility pattern on high-risk content, where metrics and reach update long after engagement.

### [`🧨 Reach Metrics Are Not Neutral`](./🧨_reach_metrics_are_not_neutral.md)  
Challenges the assumption that analytics reflect reality; documents how reach is structurally minimised for targeted voices.

### [`🖱 Tactile Throttling – When Interaction Becomes Interference`](./🖱_tactile_throttling_when_interaction_becomes_interference.md)  
Records interface-level suppression where basic user interactions (e.g., text selection) are disrupted to frustrate evidence gathering and introduce friction.

### [`🚫 Blocked At The Gateway`](./🚫_blocked_at_the_gateway.md)  
Documents targeted communication suppression, particularly blocking or routing failures for urgent legal and human rights submissions.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Comment Order** covers conversational distortion, often paired with **Delayed Visibility**’s throttling patterns.  
- **Reach Metrics** records how both distortions feed into skewed analytics.  
- **Tactile Throttling** addresses physical interaction interference, which may operate alongside all other suppression types.  
- **Blocked At The Gateway** captures cases where suppression escalates to total communication failure.  
- All scripts link outward to **Big Picture Protocols** for systemic context.
