# 🪓 Mean/Evidence Template  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*A countermeasure for holding both the “hot” and “admissible” versions of survivor testimony*  

---

## Context  

Survivors are often forced to choose:  
- **Vent the raw truth** → risk discredit, reputational harm, or punishment.  
- **Filter into admissible record** → lose affect, tone, and urgency.  

The *Mean/Evidence Template* is an anti-containment clause: it preserves both.  

---

## Structure  

```markdown
### 🪓 Mean Version (private vent)  
Unfiltered, sharp, angry, sarcastic. Logged so it exists.  

---

### 🗂️ Evidence Version (for record)  
Factual, stripped of heat but holding the same core point.  
```

---

## Function  

- **Protects survivor affect** → anger, humour, and grief are retained privately.  
- **Preserves evidentiary legibility** → a parallel version is documented in a format admissible to systems.  
- **Refuses cooling** → the heat is not erased, only compartmentalised.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Mean/Evidence Template* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a structured countermeasure to containment by cooling, ensuring survivor affect is logged without sacrificing evidentiary integrity.
