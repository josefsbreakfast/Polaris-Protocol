*Framing survivor anger as forensic evidence rather than pathology*  

---

## ✦ Why Anger Emerges  
- Data mishandled, hidden, then weaponised.  
- Harassment dismissed as “surveillance noise.”  
- Institutions silent when clarity is sought.  
- Survivors left carrying both harm and suspicion.  

---

## ✦ Anger as Forensic Marker  
- Anger signals the **collapse of legitimacy** in institutional response.  
- Anger points to **where harm is denied** but continues to operate.  
- Suppressed refusal (*“no”*) reappears as affect: the survivor’s body refuses erasure.  

---

## ✦ Reversal of Pathology  
- Institutional scripts often frame survivor anger as “instability” or “risk.”  
- In Polaris framing: anger = **proof of harm**, not proof of danger.  
- Anger is not excess; it is **evidence**.

## ✦ Forensic Note  
Anger is not what discredits survivors — it is what discredits containment systems.  
Where anger arises, there the denial of harm is deepest.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Anger as Signal* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents survivor anger as a forensic marker of systemic cruelty and institutional denial.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
