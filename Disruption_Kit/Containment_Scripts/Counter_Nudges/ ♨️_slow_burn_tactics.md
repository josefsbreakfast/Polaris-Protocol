## Overview  

Slow burn tactics are a form of resistance calibrated to exhaust the containment system over time without triggering major escalations. 
These tactics exploit bureaucratic inertia, attention scarcity, and metadata dependencies. 
Their power lies in cumulative disruption, not singular impact. Like snowflakes, one may be tolerable, but many may feel like an avalanche.

## Key Characteristics  

- 🪫 **Unremarkable on the surface**, but metabolically expensive to track  
- 🔁 **Loop-breaking**, through unpredictability and lateral moves  
- 📡 **Signal saturation**, without triggering obvious flags  
- 🧩 **Multi-thread pressure**, increasing entropy within control systems  
- ⏳ **Tactical patience**, designed for threshold creep

## Techniques  

### 1. *Rhythmic Interference*  
Break your own metadata rhythm with:  
- Late-night uploads and early morning dispatches  
- Intermittent silence followed by rapid-fire output  

### 2. *Geospatial Anomalies*  
- Take a random route but one which stays *plausibly boring*  
- Sit in [redacted site] without incident  
- Exit and re-enter neutral spaces quickly to force repeat flagging  

### 3. *Platform Inconsistencies*  
- Alternate formats across platforms (Substack one day, LinkedIn carousel the next)  
- Use alt-text strategically to embed emotional variance  
- Tag but do not tag: leave metadata ambiguity in intentional partial references  

### 4. *Narrative Misdirection*  
- Introduce emotional tones that can’t be clearly labelled (e.g. sarcastic vulnerability)  
- Make declarative statements laced with conditional logic  
- Refuse to resolve your own sentence trajectories

## Example Actions  

- Visiting sites flagged for different political affiliations across a short time window  
- Embedding legal theory inside an informal or lifestyle-style post  
- Messaging a monitored channel with completely mundane content  
- Uploading poetry followed by a metadata audit log  

---

## Metadata Impact  

These tactics force:  
- Repeated behavioural recalibration  
- Increased audit time per trace  
- Classifier destabilisation  
- Emotional attunement strain on handlers  

---

## Risks  

- May still provoke attention if patterns emerge too obviously  
- Requires strong internal coherence to avoid fatigue or confusion  
- Can be misread by allies if not accompanied by strategic signalling  

---

## Polaris Note  

This tactic is ideal for periods where direct confrontation is too dangerous or has been exhausted. 
It invites system error and handler fatigue, not immediate rupture. 
Use it to set the stage for the next breakpoint.
