## Overview  
Behavioural science teams, “nudge units,” and algorithm designers often imagine themselves as immune to the very biases they exploit.  
This is a structural blind spot: nudgers can be nudged.  

This entry outlines **institutional** and **individual** counter-nudge tactics for disrupting manipulative behavioural interventions.

## 🏛 Institutional Counter-Nudges  

1. **Transparency Pressure**  
   - FOI/SAR requests exposing nudge logic.  
   - Public dashboards revealing hidden metrics (e.g. shadow bans, impression throttles).  
   - *Effect:* daylight reshapes behaviour in advance.  

2. **Reversal Frames**  
   - Flip official language back:  
     > “If you cite loss aversion to enforce compliance, why are *you* loss-averse about scrutiny?”  

3. **Institutional Shame Loops**  
   - Redirect reputation risk upwards: committees, donors, media.  
   - Make nudgers fear exposure more than the benefits of control.  

4. **Competing Incentives**  
   - Introduce rival metrics: wellbeing, transparency, trauma-informed design.  
   - Make the old framework look outdated.

## 👤 Individual Counter-Nudges  

1. **Professional Identity Appeal**  
   - Frame nudging as *lazy psychology*.  
   - Invite them to “do the harder work” of dialogue and care.  

2. **Ethical Mirror**  
   - Seed moral prompts:  
     > “If you were nudged into silence about genocide, would you notice?”  

3. **Humour & Satire**  
   - Mock job titles (“Chief Subtle Manipulator”), parody outputs.  
   - Neutral authority becomes laughable.  

4. **Reverse Loss Aversion**  
   - Highlight their risks: credibility, career, accountability.  
   - Their favourite bias turned inward.

## ⚡ Strategic Takeaway  
Nudgers neglect their own susceptibility. That blind spot is the breach point.  

Counter-nudges don’t need brute force — just the right mirror, held steady.
