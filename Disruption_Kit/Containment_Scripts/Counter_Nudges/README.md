## 📝 Notes  
- This folder documents **applied counter-nudge strategies** inside the Polaris Protocol.  
- Each entry serves as both a **field guide** and **forensic record** — written to survive adversarial containment.  
- Diagrams and probes are stored locally in `media/` but mirrored here when relevant.
