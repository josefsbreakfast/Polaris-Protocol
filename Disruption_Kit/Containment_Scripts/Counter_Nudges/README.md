## 📝 Notes  

- This folder documents **applied counter-nudge strategies** inside the Polaris Protocol.  
- Each entry serves as both a **field guide** and a **forensic record** — designed to survive adversarial containment.  
- Diagrams and probes are stored locally but mirrored here when directly referenced.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Counter Nudges* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers tactics and forensic methods designed to reverse, subvert, and expose manipulative behavioural interventions deployed in containment environments.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
