## 📝 Notes  
- This folder documents **applied counter-nudge strategies** inside the Polaris Protocol.  
- Each entry serves as both a **field guide** and **forensic record** — written to survive adversarial containment.  
- Diagrams and probes are stored locally in `media/` but mirrored here when relevant.

*Counter Nudges* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers tactics and forensic methods designed to reverse, subvert, and expose manipulative behavioural interventions deployed in containment environments.
