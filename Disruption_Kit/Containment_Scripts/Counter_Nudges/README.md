## 📝 Notes  

- Documents **applied counter-nudge strategies** within the Polaris Protocol.  
- Each entry serves as both a **field guide** and a **forensic record**, designed to survive adversarial containment.  
- Diagrams and probes are stored locally but mirrored here when directly referenced.  
- Cross-links are encouraged between **Suppression Modes** and **Counter Nudges** to show how each containment script can be met with a countermeasure.

*🧨 Counter Nudges* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers tactics and forensic methods designed to reverse, subvert, and expose manipulative behavioural interventions deployed in containment environments.
