# 🛠 Practical Resilience Nodes

**First created:** 2025-08-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-31

*Survivor-led strategies for navigating daily suppression, conserving energy, and redistributing labour under containment conditions.*  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This stub holds a planned collection of **practical resilience strategies**.  
It gathers short, actionable nodes designed to:  

- Reduce exhaustion loops  
- Preserve continuity under disruption  
- Share tactics across survivor networks  

---

## 🌱 Seed Strategies  

- **Batch work** → Assume 30–40% of tasks may need repeating; build in margin to absorb disruption.  
- **Parallel channels** → Send key communications by more than one route (e.g. email + print + platform).  
- **Snapshots** → Take quick local copies of progress (drafts, witness statements) to prevent total loss.  
- **Community relay** → Share outputs early with trusted networks to spread both the labour and the proof.  

These are starting points; further survivor contributions will expand this node.

*Practical Resilience Nodes* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It collects survivor-authored strategies for enduring and outlasting containment frictions, ensuring knowledge continuity under hostile conditions.
