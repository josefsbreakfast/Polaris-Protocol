# 🪬 Reclaiming the Engineered Body  
**First created:** 2025-10-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-20  
*Connecting surveillance-induced intimacy breach to xenofeminist technomaterialism.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node links survivor-centred accounts of *surveillance-induced intimacy breach* to the theoretical frame of **xenofeminism (XF)** — the 2015 manifesto by the collective *Laboria Cuboniks*.  
XF offers language for transforming alienation and technological violence into instruments of liberation rather than retreat.

---

## 🧩 Key Ideas  

1. **If nature is unjust, change nature.**  
   Surveillance infrastructures naturalise control over bodies; XF refuses that inevitability.  

2. **Gender abolition as unbinding, not erasure.**  
   The goal is to abolish gender as *a regime of compulsion*, not to erase embodied difference.  
   In this frame, reclaiming a surveilled body is an act of *post-gender autonomy engineering*.  

3. **Technomaterialism as feminist weaponry.**  
   Tools of observation can be repurposed for witness, refusal, or redirection —  
   *surveillance reversed into seeing-back*.  

4. **Alienation repurposed.**  
   XF reclaims alienation as an emancipatory distance: a gap through which new agency can be programmed.  
   Survivors living through data-bodied violation inhabit alienation already; XF treats that as raw material for redesign.

## 🔍 Application to Survivor Lexicon  

XF helps articulate how **psychosexual occupation via surveillance** is both a *technological and ideological breach*.  
Re-engineering autonomy means more than privacy; it means *modifying the architectures of seeing* so that intimacy, agency, and embodiment can coexist without capture.

> The survivor’s body, once turned into a networked surface, becomes a site for experimental sovereignty.

*🪬 Reclaiming the Engineered Body* is a living bridge node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It connects survivor experience of surveillance-based sexualisation with xenofeminist strategies for repurposing technology and alienation toward bodily sovereignty.
