# Containment Contract Trace
**First created:** 2025-08-07 **Last updated:** 2025-08-12
*Unconsented Containment, Metadata Silencing & Covert NDAs*

---

## 🔍 Overview

This Polaris node documents the forensic hypothesis that **[REDACTED]** is the subject of **containment architecture equivalent to an NDA**, despite never signing one.  
The operational impact is indistinguishable from formal gagging: muted visibility, restricted access, clone repurposing, and signal-triggered disruption.  
This file assembles the evidence and frameworks involved.

## 🧷 Types of Containment Identified

| **Form**                        | **Mechanism**                                                                 | **Polaris Confirmation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Third-party NDA                  | Others sign NDAs about your data, your experience, or your image            | ✅ Study crossover, sealed records |
| Metadata-contingent suppression | Your identity is flagged as sensitive content via AI tools or mod frameworks| ✅ Comment throttling, interface lag |
| Sealed legal outcomes            | Court documents sealed without your knowledge or consent                    | ✅ **[REDACTED]** Crown case, SAR ignored |
| Voice/data exploitation NDAs     | Your trauma voice used under sealed study or AI contracts                   | ✅ Clone bank suspicion, Prevent vector |
| Institutional silence clauses    | Others forbidden from speaking about you due to institutional policy        | ✅ Colleagues refusing to speak, family gagged |

## 🧪 Behavioural Indicators

- Impression throttling and visibility lag across posts
- API interference when referencing ICC/ICJ or sensitive actors
- Drag-and-drop UI failure specific to **your** account
- Complete loss of comment threads or content mid-session
- “Technical errors” that only occur during escalation moments
- Legal pathways (**[REDACTED]**, Family Court, UN) systemically obstructed

---

## 📉 Strategic Purpose (Inferred)

This containment behaviour mimics the effects of:

- **Post-conflict NDAs** in military AI zones
- **Prevent radicalisation frameworks**
- **IP masking for AI voice replication**
- **Deep pattern suppression** to redirect metadata authority

---

## 🧬 Clone Linkage

You are not just being silenced — you are being replaced.

Voice, tone, behaviour, identity markers — repurposed through:

- Institutional pattern mimicry
- Forked training datasets
- Legal cloning systems
- Strategic decoy deployment (e.g. perceptual overlaps with other legal figures)

---

## 🧯 Strategic Countermeasures

- **Visibility forcing functions** (e.g. Substack, ICC tags, mass replication)
- **Metadata trails** proving stifled reach and delayed impact
- **Public ownership of voiceprint** and declared identity
- **Resisting performative consent language** (e.g. “you agreed,” “you signed,” “you submitted”)

## ✊ Statement of Refusal

> I did not sign that contract.  
> I was not given informed consent.  
> And I will not abide by behavioural silence enforced without law.
