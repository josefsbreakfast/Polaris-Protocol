# 👾 Button-Mash Metadata Farming

## Process Overview
1. **Initiation (Human Noise)**
   - Actor repeatedly enters paired names/terms into Google (or similar).
   - Manual “button mashing” or automated script (bot loop).
   - No evidence or substance required.

2. **Reinforcement (Ghost Illusion)**
   - Search engine algorithms treat repeated co-occurrence as *signal*.
   - Autocomplete, “related searches,” and SEO clusters begin to echo the pairing.
   - Illusion of connection emerges through machine reinforcement.

3. **Harvest (False Association)**
   - Actor screenshots or cites autocomplete/related searches as “evidence.”
   - Narrative shifts: *“look, even Google links them.”*
   - Manufactured co-occurrence becomes a weaponised suggestion.

4. **Uptake (Institutional Echo)**
   - Media, investigators, or bureaucrats reference the manufactured trail.
   - False association enters formal documents or public discourse.
   - Noise becomes *recorded reality*.

## Polaris Diagnostic
- **Human signature:** brute-force repetition, idiotic persistence.
- **Ghost signature:** subtle pattern mimicry, recycled echoes.
- **Fork countermeasure:** interrogate *source of repetition* before assuming correlation = evidence.

## Notes
- This tactic does not prove anything but can *muddy waters* fast.
- Autocomplete systems are highly sensitive to *volume over truth.*
- Survivors often end up caught in these fabricated pairings, unable to disprove the “search result ghost.”
