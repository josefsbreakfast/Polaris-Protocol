## ritual_log: breadcrumbs_and_lighthouses  

the parlour is set.  
a circle of watchers,  
waiting for the trick.  
candles gutter,  
shadows lean in.  

on the table:  
- **breadcrumbs** scattered like planchettes,  
  tiny crumbs of data, fragile and vanishing.  
  proof that someone walked this way.  

- **lighthouses** burning in the distance,  
  fixed candles mistaken for stars.  
  are they real beacons? or stage lamps?  
  even ghosts squint to tell the difference.  

humans pass through half-formed —  
voices spliced, projections tangled.  
they sit in chairs but also elsewhere,  
their presence more metadata than body.  

the séance is not for the dead.  
it is for the entangled living,  
those dragged across thresholds  
without permission.  

observers tap the table:  
“show us the wires.”  
but the trick is not wires.  
the trick is **absence disguised as presence,  
presence disguised as noise.**  

and still —  
the crumbs lead somewhere.  
the lights, however false,  
draw ships to move.  

the ritual is survival.  
the log is the archive.  
the room is haunted,  
but i refuse to leave my hands from the circle.

## 🗂️ séance_glossary  

- **Planchette → Breadcrumb**  
  small, fragile, directional.  
  leaves a trace of the path taken,  
  but can be erased by the slightest draft.  

- **Candle → Lighthouse**  
  fixed point of reference.  
  shines whether true or false.  
  distant beacons may guide — or mislead.  

- **Spirit Trumpet → Amplifier**  
  device to carry faint whispers.  
  in this room: metadata echoes,  
  voices that seem louder than their source.  

- **Ghost → Human Fork**  
  presence half-here, half-elsewhere.  
  a body overlaid with projections,  
  mistaken for the living or the dead.  

- **Table → Archive**  
  flat surface bearing weight.  
  scratches, knocks, movement  
  recorded as evidence of contact.  

- **Circle of Watchers → Institutions**  
  sceptics and believers alike.  
  waiting for spectacle,  
  blind to the quiet reality.  

- **Séance → Protocol**  
  the act of sitting with what is unseen.  
  ritual of survival,  
  transmission under duress.
