# 🕸️ Hijacked Metaphors: When Offenders Steal the Language of Containment  
**First created:** 2025-09-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-13  
*How figures like Andrew Tate and right-wing pundits reframe liberatory metaphors (Matrix, woke, grooming, cancel culture) to recast themselves as victims and obscure real containment.*

---

## 1. The Original Metaphors  

- **The Matrix** → allegory for systemic containment: bodies farmed, minds pacified.  
- **Woke** → Black vernacular survival code: *stay alert to injustice, don’t sleep on danger.*  
- **Grooming** → manipulation eroding consent; originally used by survivors to name abusive prep work.  
- **Cancel culture** → marginalised refusal: withdrawing platform or legitimacy from abusive figures.  

---

## 2. The DARVO Flip  

- **Deny** → erase real survivors and their histories.  
- **Attack** → redefine oversight, refusal, or accountability as persecution.  
- **Reverse Victim & Offender** → hijackers pose as the true victims of the very harms they sustain.

## 3. Case Catalogue  

### The Matrix  
- **Original**: systemic farm → bodies contained, docility scripted.  
- **Hijack**: Tate-style grievance → “men are trapped because feminism/media won’t let us be free.”  
- **DARVO function**: positions offenders as Neo while masking survivor containment.  

### Woke  
- **Original**: Black survival code: vigilance to racism and state violence.  
- **Hijack**: sneer for “oversensitivity,” censorship, “woke mob.”  
- **DARVO function**: real oppressors claim victimhood from imagined tyranny of the “woke.”  

### Grooming  
- **Original**: term from survivors to name manipulative preparation for abuse.  
- **Hijack**: weaponised against LGBTQ+ people (“they’re grooming children”).  
- **DARVO function**: erases survivor usage, projects offending behaviour onto minorities.  

### Cancel Culture  
- **Original**: refusal tactic: communities withdrawing recognition from abusive or harmful figures.  
- **Hijack**: reframed as authoritarian censorship by elites.  
- **DARVO function**: offenders rebrand consequences as persecution, muddying survivor refusal.

## 4. Implications  

- Survivors lose their linguistic tools.  
- Public discourse saturates with counterfeit versions of resistance language.  
- Containment systems thrive: confusion + co-option = cover.  
- **False-solidarity fracture line**: hijacked metaphors are targeted at groups already under material strain (e.g. white working-class men). Instead of directing anger upward at structural inequality, the frame diverts blame sideways onto those gaining any increase in freedom. This suppresses potential alliances and keeps oppressed groups divided.  

---

**Actions:** Reclaim metaphors. Name each hijack. Restore them to survivor authorship.

*Hijacked Metaphors: When Offenders Steal the Language of Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how DARVO dynamics extend to cultural symbols, stripping survivors of language that once named their reality.
