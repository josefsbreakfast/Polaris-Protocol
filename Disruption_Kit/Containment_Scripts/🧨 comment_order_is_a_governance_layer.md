# 🧨 Comment Order Is a Governance Layer  
`Polaris Protocol – Containment Scripts Node`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To expose and document manipulation of comment visibility and sequencing as a platform-level moderation tactic. Comments are not just conversation—they are visibility anchors, emotional cues, and metadata validators. Their order matters.

---

## 🧩 Manipulation Patterns

- Algorithmic reordering to elevate discrediting replies
- Shadow suppression of high-quality, high-empathy replies
- Emotional tone inversion (e.g., sarcasm flagged over seriousness)
- Broken threading used to destabilise narrative cohesion

---

## 📂 Tracked Instances

- LinkedIn survivor response threads
- ICC legal advocacy posts
- Anti-genocide calls with high male viewership

---

## 🧠 Implications

- Comment manipulation used to distort tone perception
- Dismissive responses often privileged algorithmically
- Survivors appear “unsupported” even when engagement is high

---

## 💡 Countermeasures

- Screenshot all comment threads at 5 min, 30 min, 6 hr intervals
- Repost high-empathy replies as visible anchors
- Annotate reordered threads in Substack audits
