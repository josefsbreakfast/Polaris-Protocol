## ✨ Overview  

Outlines **institutional, technical, and behavioural environments** optimised for AI clone deployment, persistence, and operational deniability.  

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Characteristics  

- **High-Volume Metadata Capture** for training and tuning potential.  
- **Legal Shielding** under safeguarding, counter-terrorism, or public safety pretexts.  
- **Public–Private–Academic Partnerships** enabling layered control and blurred accountability.  
- **Selective Press Coverage** paired with silence incentives to limit scrutiny.

|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Family Court      | 🔥🔥🔥      | Voice/empathy manipulation       |
| Clinical Training | 🔥🔥         | Affective AI calibration         |
| Advocacy Panels   | 🔥🔥         | Dissent mimicking                |

*Clone Friendly Architecture* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps environments where AI-driven replication is embedded into institutions and policy frameworks under the guise of care, safety, or advocacy.
