## 📅 2025 — Re-Justification & Containment  

- **“Political Impartiality” guidance** issued to schools and public bodies, limiting activism.

## 🧭 Analytic Continuities  

1. **Symbolic to Structural:** BLM moment → institutional plans → bureaucratic stall.  
2. **Containment Learning:** state and media develop templates for absorbing outrage.  
3. **Substitution:** race → security → Palestine → “woke risk.”  
4. **Re-justification:** racism returns as “safety policy.”
