# 🚨 Super-Injunctions and SLAPPs in Rape Cases  
**First created:** 2025-09-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Mapping how legal secrecy regimes erase survivors’ testimony and entrench silencing.*  

---

## 🌐 Introduction  
This node maps how super-injunctions and SLAPP-like mechanisms intersect with rape cases in the UK.  
- Intended for protection, they can become tools of coercion and silencing.  
- Survivors are forced into invisibility, eroding trust in justice.  

---

## ⚖️ What Happens in Law  
- **Automatic anonymity** for complainants in sexual offences (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992).  
- **Injunctions** can block identifying detail.  
- **Super-injunctions** escalate this: silence on both the case *and* the existence of the order.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Experience  
- Testimony treated as Crown property, not personal speech.  
- Survivors risk contempt if they speak their own story.  
- Feels like *“legalised lying”* — forced to act as if nothing happened.  

---

## 🛑 When It Functions as a SLAPP  
- Purpose shifts: safeguarding → reputation protection.  
- Survivor reframed as risk to confidentiality rather than rights-holder.  
- Enforced via civil contempt or, for Crown servants, court martial.  

---

## 🕸️ Enforcement Web  
- **MoJ / HMCTS:** silence through civil courts.  
- **Cabinet Office / Attorney General:** coordinate restrictions across departments.  
- **MOD:** Service Test + chain of command punish disclosure.  
- **Media:** gagged via injunction register.  
- **Regulators:** blocked from acting on survivor complaints if sealed.  

---

## 📉 Duty of Care vs Reality  
- **On paper:** GDPR, safeguarding codes, whistleblowing protection.  
- **In practice:** orders override; survivors raising valid concerns risk harassment, surveillance, reprisal.  

---

## 👁️ Harassment & Surveillance as “Enforcement”  
- Survivors monitored to prevent leaks.  
- Justified as protecting secrets, but functions as intimidation.  
- Extends SLAPP logic into daily life: exhausting, isolating, retraumatising.  

---

## 🌋 Why This Matters  
- Convergence of SLAPPs + super-injunctions destroys trust in justice.  
- Survivors lose autonomy over their own testimony.  
- Silencing undermines UK compliance with international law (IHL, CEDAW, Istanbul Convention).

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
