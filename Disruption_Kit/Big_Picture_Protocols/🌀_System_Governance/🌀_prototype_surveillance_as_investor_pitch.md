# 🌀 Prototype Surveillance as Investor Pitch

*Hypothesis node: surveillance programme framed as commercial pilot for investor-ready product rather than purely national-interest intelligence.*

## 📜 Premise  

Field observations (see [🛰️ 2025-09-26 Field Log — Cognitive Fatigue and Prototype Premise](../../Field_Logs/🛰️_2025-09-26_field_log_cognitive_fatigue_and_prototype_premise.md) indicate a pattern consistent with a **prototype commercial run**.  

This node outlines the hypothesised structure and logic.

---

## 🛰️ Hypothesised Structure  

- **Pilot Group Usage:** small cohort treated as live test-bed to stress-test model before investor pitch.  
- **Investor-Facing Metrics:** need for clean, “perfect” outcomes drives heavy intervention to eliminate anomalies.  
- **Data Manipulation:** stressful events inserted, data biased or “fudged” to improve apparent success rates.  
- **Commercial Incentive:** behaviour resembles marketing campaign rather than intelligence gathering.  
- **Experimental Hygiene Lapse:** lack of genuine control/outlier acceptance undermines scientific validity.  

---

## 🧠 Implications  

- Surveillance justified under national-interest logic may actually be subsidising private product development.  
- Ethics and legality distorted by commercial stakes.  
- Victims framed as “inputs” in a marketing demo rather than citizens under lawful investigation.

*Prototype Surveillance as Investor Pitch* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It explores how observed containment tactics might align with investor-driven prototyping rather than public-interest intelligence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
