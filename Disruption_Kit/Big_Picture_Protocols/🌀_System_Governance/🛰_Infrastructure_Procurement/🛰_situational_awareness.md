## 🧠 What is SA?
<a id="what-is-sa"></a>

**Human SA** = perception → comprehension → projection (meaning-making under pressure).  
**Computational SA** = sensing → fusion/analysis → operating picture (statistics under uncertainty).

## 🦁 Where it’s used
<a id="industry-uses"></a>

- **Emergency ops**: incident rooms, COPs for floods/fires.  
- **Cybersecurity**: SOC logs → anomaly detection → alerts.  
- **Aviation/transport**: sensor fusion, threat/error management.  
- **Healthcare ops**: triage scores, telemetry, dashboards.  
- **Finance**: risk engines, Monte Carlo, stress tests.  
- **Industrial ops/energy**: SCADA, IIoT fault prediction.  
- **Platforms**: content ranking, trust & safety queues.

## 🐝 C2 → C6-ISR arc
<a id="c2-c6-isr"></a>

**C2** = Command & Control  
**C3** = + Communications  
**C4** = + Computers  
**C4-ISR** = + Intelligence/Surveillance/Reconnaissance  
**C5-ISR** = + Collaboration/Coordination  
**C6-ISR** = + Cyber/Complex Systems Integration

## 📠 Human vs Computer (table)
<a id="human-vs-computer-table"></a>

| Dimension | Human SA | Computational SA |
|---|---|---|
| Core engine | Meaning-making & abduction | Probabilities & patterning |
| Strength | Flexible improvisation; values | Scale, speed, vigilance |
| Blind spot | Stress, tunnel vision, bias | Semantics, context, tail risk |
| Failure cost | Local but can cascade | Systemic, fast, opaque |
| Trust lever | Training, drills, culture | Data quality, evals, guardrails |

## 🐍 Risk reality check
<a id="risk-reality"></a>

- **Low error ≠ low harm**: 2% of 5M = 100k affected.  
- **Tail risk**: rare events dominate damage.  
- **Chaos**: small errors amplify downstream.  
- **Reality checks**: report absolute numbers, publish confidence intervals, expected-harm calcs, kill switches.

## 🚨 Civilianisation problem
<a id="civilianisation"></a>

C4/C5-ISR stacks are now used in civilian domains (policing, social care, finance, platforms).  
- **No shared doctrine**, **no uniform ROE**, **patchy oversight**, **incentives to over-deploy**.  
- Imported capability without discipline = systemic risk.  
- Civilian sectors need ISR-grade **safety culture**.

## 👑 Governance & roles
<a id="governance"></a>

**Pre-deployment**: Safety cases, sandbox pilots, model/data cards, red-team reports.  
**Runtime**: Tiered risk, human-on-the-loop, decision logs, alert hygiene.  
**Incidents**: Mandatory reporting, public postmortems, recertification.  

### RACI snapshot
| Actor | Accountabilities | Proof-of-work |
|---|---|---|
| Citizens/Users | Control, complaint/redress | Opt-outs, ombuds pathways |
| Operators/Teams | Runbooks, halt authority | On-call drills, overrides |
| Developers | Data sheets, evals, monitors | Pre-flight checks, red-teams |
| Product/UX | Honest consent, safe design | No dark patterns, quiet hours |
| Security/Privacy | Threat models, minimisation | Adversarial tests, DP |
| Compliance/Risk | Audit, tiering | Audit packs, logs |
| Regulators | Baselines, audits, penalties | Certs, registry, recall powers |
| Government | Rights guardrails, oversight | Laws, aid, remedy |
