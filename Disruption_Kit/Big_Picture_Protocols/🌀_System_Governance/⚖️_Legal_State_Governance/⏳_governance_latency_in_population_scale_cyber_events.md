# ⏳ Governance Latency in Population‑Scale Cyber Events
**First created:** 2025-10-13  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-13  
*Explains why mid‑range cyberattacks affecting partial populations escape notice for months.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Outlines the structural lag between real‑world infection curves and national response capability.

---

## 🧪 Detection Latency  
Seed (0–30d, looks like noise) → Spread (30–90d, under alert thresholds) → Notice (reports cohere) → Attribution (1–3 months).

## 🏛️ Response Latency  
Verification loop, coordination loop, attribution risk, authority limits, international dependencies.

## 💉 Vaccination Analogy  
Preparedness beats cure: baseline hardening, telemetry partnerships, pre‑approved standing orders.

## ⚡ Faster Governance Model  
| Bottleneck | Old world | Next‑gen |
|---|---|---|
| Detection | Wait for reports | Continuous, privacy‑preserving telemetry sharing |
| Legal mandate | Case‑by‑case | Contingency authorities for incident classes |
| Coordination | Ad hoc calls | Federated incident rooms |
| Communication | Weeks of silence | Tiered alerts (quiet→advisory→emergency) |
| Recovery | Each org solo | National restore images & services |
