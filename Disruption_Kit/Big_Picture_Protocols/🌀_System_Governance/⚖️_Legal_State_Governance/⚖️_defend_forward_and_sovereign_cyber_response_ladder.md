# ⚖️ Defend Forward & Sovereign Cyber Response Ladder
**First created:** 2025-10-13  |  **Last updated:** 2025-12-15  
*Maps the escalation ladder from cooperative defence to authorised cross‑border disruption.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Policy reference for state decision‑makers: when, how, and under what legal tests a state may conduct active cyber defence.

---

## 🪜 The Ladder  
1) **Cooperative remediation** — provider takedowns, sinkholes, credential rotation.  
2) **Law‑enforcement disruption** — seizures, warrants, MLATs.  
3) **Coalition disruption** — multistate actions, sanctions, coordinated takedowns.  
4) **Authorised state intrusion (rare)** — narrow, proportionate objectives with oversight and exit criteria.

---

## ⚖️ Guardrails  
Attribution threshold, sovereignty & use‑of‑force limits, domestic legal authority, proportionality & minimisation, oversight/auditability.

---

## ✅ Decision Checklist  
Attribution multi‑source? Authorities in hand? Least‑harm alternative exhausted? Coalition support? Forensics plan? Communications & de‑escalation ready?

---

## ⚠️ Strategic Risks  
Misattribution, escalation spiral, legal exposure for private actors, evidence contamination, tradecraft burn.
