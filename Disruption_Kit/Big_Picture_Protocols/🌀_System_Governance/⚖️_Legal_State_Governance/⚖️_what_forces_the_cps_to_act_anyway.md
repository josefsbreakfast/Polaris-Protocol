*The rare conditions under which elite prosecution becomes unavoidable*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

Despite risk aversion, elite prosecutions *do* sometimes happen.

This node identifies the **forcing conditions** — the points where discretion collapses and action becomes unavoidable.

---

## 🔑 Forcing Condition 1: Overdetermined Evidence

When evidence is:
- multiple-source
- contemporaneous
- corroborated
- documentary or digital

Discretion narrows dramatically.

Elite status cannot out-argue proof density.

---

## 🔊 Forcing Condition 2: Victim Multiplicity

Multiple complainants:
- reduce credibility attacks
- alter jury perception
- increase public scrutiny
- change internal risk calculus

Pattern beats prestige.

---

## 🗞️ Forcing Condition 3: Media Saturation

Sustained, evidence-led reporting:
- raises reputational cost of inaction
- locks institutions into public positions
- reduces ability to quietly drop cases

Visibility constrains discretion.

---

## 🧨 Forcing Condition 4: Institutional Spillover Risk

When non-prosecution threatens:
- international credibility
- regulatory exposure
- civil liability cascades
- foreign jurisdiction action

Action becomes the *less dangerous* option.

---

## ⚖️ Forcing Condition 5: External Jurisdiction Pressure

If another jurisdiction is:
- investigating
- indicting
- cooperating with victims

Domestic inaction becomes untenable.

---

## ⚠️ The Hard Truth

The CPS rarely acts *because justice demands it*.

It acts because **inaction becomes more dangerous than action**.

That is the current equilibrium.
