# 🛰️ Civic Oversight of AI Partnerships  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*Why FOI, OSINT, and civic audit are structural requirements for any state–AI vendor partnership.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node describes the civic oversight required when public bodies (e.g. the MoJ, Home Office, DWP, CPS, NHS) partner with AI vendors such as OpenAI, Palantir, Microsoft, or data integrators like Capita and CGI.

Polaris treats AI partnerships as **containment architecture**: infrastructure that can centralise decision-making, obscure accountability, and render harm invisible behind technical abstraction.

Oversight of AI is therefore not optional — it is **constitutional hygiene**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Transparency dependency** — AI systems cannot be scrutinised without FOI/OSINT visibility.  
- **Model provenance** — knowing what data was used to train, test, or fine-tune is non-negotiable.  
- **Vendor capture risk** — “innovation pilots” that bypass procurement safeguards.  
- **Shadow governance** — algorithmic outputs acting as de facto policy.  
- **Distributed oversight** — civic coalitions, not just regulators.

---

## 🧿 Why AI Partnerships Require More Transparency, Not Less  
AI systems amplify whatever governance structure they are embedded in.

If that structure is fair → AI scales fairness.  
If that structure is captured → AI scales capture.  
If that structure is opaque → AI becomes a **black box built on a black box**.

Therefore, civic visibility must increase *before* deployment.

---

## 🍄 The Problem: “Model Knows, Public Does Not”  
When government partners with AI vendors:

- the public cannot see training data  
- the public cannot see model assumptions  
- risk frameworks are often proprietary  
- decisions can be justified with “the model says so”  
- FOI is often stonewalled with “commercial sensitivity”  
- oversight bodies are outpaced by rapid deployment

A democratic state cannot outsource the **ability to know**.

---

## ⚖️ FOI/OSINT As Anti-Capture Infrastructure  

To maintain legitimacy, governments must guarantee:

1. **FOI compatibility**  
   Contracts must explicitly require vendors to process and supply FOI-relevant material.  
   No exemptions for “trade secrets” without clear, proportionate justification.

2. **Open schema logs**  
   Decision logs, audit trails, and model metadata must be accessible in plain format.

3. **OSINT-ready procurement**  
   Public architecture diagrams, vendor lists, and DPIAs allow civic verification.

4. **Algorithmic effects registers**  
   For every AI use:  
   - purpose  
   - population affected  
   - data sources  
   - known biases  
   - human-in-the-loop locations  
   - refusal mechanisms

If a system cannot tolerate scrutiny, it should not be deployed.

---

## 🪼 Vendor Capture: How It Happens  

AI vendors often:

- pitch models directly to ministers or senior officials  
- offer “free pilots” that become dependencies  
- embed proprietary decision-points in routine workflows  
- shape DPIA language  
- normalise emergency powers  
- create narrative pressure (“innovation”, “efficiency”, “future of justice”)

This creates **policy gravity** around the vendor, not the public.

---

## 🧨 Civic Countermeasures  

Practical steps for maintaining oversight:

- **FOI request pairing**  
  Ask for:  
  - model documentation  
  - training data categories  
  - vendor oversight minutes  
  - risk assessments  
  - red-team reports  

- **Vendor SAR**  
  Identify whether your data was used for:  
  - training  
  - fine-tuning  
  - evaluation  
  - red-teaming  
  - hallucination correction  

- **Public architecture mapping**  
  OSINT-led diagrams of pipelines, databases, contracts, and model-insertion points.

- **Rights-based technical literacy**  
  Communities trained to spot when a decision hides behind an “algorithm”.

- **Fail-open doctrine**  
  If explanations cannot be given, decisions revert to human accountability by default.

---

## 🔥 Indicators Of Captured AI Deployment  

A system becomes illegitimate when:

- DPIAs reference vendors more than public interest  
- FOI replies contain copy-pasted corporate language  
- providers define risk thresholds instead of regulators  
- the model is deployed in “silent pilot” form  
- public servants cannot explain the system they must rely on  
- the public cannot appeal algorithmic decisions in plain English  

The rule is simple:  
If the public cannot meaningfully challenge a system, it is **not democratic**.

*🛰️ Civic Oversight of AI Partnerships* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It sets out the transparency and accountability structures that must exist before, during, and after public–AI vendor collaboration, ensuring democratic control over algorithmic power.
