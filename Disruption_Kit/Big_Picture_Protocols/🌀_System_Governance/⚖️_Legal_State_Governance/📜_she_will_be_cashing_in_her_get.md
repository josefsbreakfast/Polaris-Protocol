## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node uses halakhic and kabbalistic frameworks as **diagnostic lenses** to analyse surveillance capitalism’s extraction from survivors—particularly rape survivors—and to trace the consequences of **intimate access without sustained responsibility**.

It does not assert jurisdiction, metaphysical enforcement, or contemporary adjudicatory authority.  
It examines what long-standing human legal–ethical systems have recognised as *obligatory once intimacy occurs*, and how severance functions when those obligations are persistently violated.

---

## ✨ Summary  

Surveillance capitalism extracts from domains of intimacy, vulnerability, trauma, and interiority while denying the obligations that such proximity traditionally triggers.

In halakhic terms, this resembles a condition in which intimacy has occurred, obligations have attached, and those obligations have been violated through neglect, abuse, or refusal of repair.

The *get* — the enforced severance from a harmful marriage — offers a precise parallel for survivor-led enforcement: not as escalation, but as **the final corrective mechanism available once responsibility has failed**.

---

## 🔥 Intimacy as a Threshold That Triggers Obligation  

Halakhah distinguishes sharply between domains of human interaction:

- commerce (mekach u’memkar) — transactional  
- kinship — inherent obligation, no contract required  
- **marriage** — exceptional, because it formalises access to vulnerability, sexuality, and embodied life  

This is why marriage requires a ketubah (Ketubot 10a–11b).

Surveillance capitalism crosses a comparable threshold by extracting:
- trauma testimony,
- affective and behavioural signals,
- voice and biometric markers,
- interior psychological states.

Once this threshold is crossed, the ethical question is no longer whether permission was perfectly articulated, but **how responsibility is exercised once access exists**.

---

## ⚖️ Ketubah Logic: Access Requires Duty  

The ketubah binds intimacy to obligation:
- material support (she’er, kesut, onah),
- dignity,
- restraint,
- repair.

Failure to uphold these duties constitutes actionable neglect (Ketubot 61b–63a).

Surveillance capitalism behaves *as if* it enjoys this level of access while refusing any equivalent duty of care, producing:

- intimacy without accountability,  
- benefit without obligation,  
- extraction without repair.  

The harm arises from the **mismatch between proximity and responsibility**.

---

## 🧾 Neglect as the Injury Itself  

Halakhah treats neglect of obligation as a distinct harm.

A marriage may be valid in form yet injurious in practice if:
- support is withheld,
- dignity eroded,
- or care refused.

Persistent neglect authorises coercive remedies (Ketubot 77a; Yevamot 63b).

Similarly, in extractive systems:
- harm compounds over time,
- repair mechanisms fail internally,
- and the burden of correction is displaced onto the harmed party.

---

## ✂️ The Get: Enforced Exit Under Harm  

The *get* does not deny that intimacy occurred.  
It asserts that **continued proximity has become unsafe**.

A woman who enforces a get from an abusive or neglectful marriage is not:
- creating harm,
- rewriting history,
- or escalating conflict.

She is:
- naming violated obligation,
- terminating exposure,
- reclaiming agency.

This maps directly onto survivor-led enforcement in extractive systems:
- the extraction occurred,
- harm accumulated,
- repair was not offered,
- rights are now asserted.

The consequences that follow are not punitive; they are **the exposure of neglected responsibility**.

---

## 🧿 Privacy, Exposure, and Hezek Re’iyah  

Bava Batra establishes *hezek re’iyah*—harm caused merely by being seen—as a legally cognisable injury (Bava Batra 2b–3a).

This principle grounds later understandings of:
- privacy,
- exposure,
- and architectural obligation to prevent invasive access.

Surveillance capitalism violates this logic by:
- creating permanent “windows” into interior life,
- denying the subject any capacity to close them,
- and treating exposure as a feature rather than a harm.

---

## 🌌 Kabbalistic Layer: Shekhinah, Proximity, and Danger  

In the Zohar, the Shekhinah is immanent in living, embodied, and vulnerable domains (Zohar I:11b; III:7b).

Proximity to Shekhinah is **dangerous without responsibility**:
- for those who dwell near her (risk of extraction and overexposure),
- and for those who approach her (risk of domination and instrumentalisation).

Surveillance capitalism fails on both sides:
- it extracts from the dwelling place of vulnerability,
- claims conduit authority over meaning and prediction,
- while accepting responsibility for neither.

In kabbalistic terms, this constitutes a further **exile (galut) of the Shekhinah**—the interruption of ethical flow between embodied life and meaning.

---

## 🧠 Consequences for the Extractor  

Halakhic and anthropological systems recognise that neglecting obligation damages not only the harmed party but the neglector.

Persistent violation produces:
- moral injury,
- internal fragmentation,
- reputational decay,
- and refusal by individuals who can no longer live with the role.

This is why people exit powerful systems despite success.  
They are not incapable. They are unwilling to become that person.

The get does not destroy the marriage.  
It reveals that it has already failed.

---

## ⚔️ Enforcement Is Not Escalation  

Survivor-led enforcement is often mischaracterised as retaliation.

Halakhic reasoning is clear:
> Enforcement occurs because harm already exists and repair was refused.

The enforcement does not create the damage.  
It **terminates continued exposure to it**.  

Which is why:  

She will be cashing in her *get*.

## 🏮 Footer  

*📜 She Will Be Cashing In Her Get* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It examines how long-standing legal–ethical systems recognise that intimate access triggers obligation—and why enforced severance becomes necessary when that obligation is persistently violated.
