# ⚖️ The Conduit and the Safeguard  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*Explaining to British compliance officers why cross‑jurisdictional data flows require explicit safeguards when Israeli law is in play.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This note clarifies why a data pathway that includes **Israeli‑jurisdiction processors or researchers** requires *additional procedural safeguards* under UK law, regardless of intent or goodwill.  

It is addressed to UK data‑protection, equality, and governance professionals who may not recognise how fundamental legal differences between the two systems affect their duties.

## ✨ The Structural Issue  

Under **UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018**, personal data belongs to the data subject.  

Under **Israeli law**, particularly in defence or national‑security contexts, data created or accessed through state‑affiliated work is treated as **state property** unless contractually exempted.  

This divergence means that a data conduit linking a UK institution to an Israeli partner can unintentionally reclassify UK personal data as Israeli state data once it enters that environment.  

---

## 🇬🇧 Why this matters for UK compliance  

- **Ownership assumptions differ.** UK law begins with *individual consent*; Israeli law often presumes *state custodianship*.  
- **Security law overrides.** Israeli data‑protection statutes defer to national‑security exemptions that are far broader than the UK’s.  
- **Downstream visibility.** Once processed under Israeli law, UK subjects have no enforceable right of access or erasure.

## 🧭 Compliance Guidance for UK Controllers  

### 1. **Contractual clarity.**  
Every Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Data‑Sharing Agreement involving Israeli partners must include a clause stating that *UK data remains governed by UK law throughout processing*.

The UK data controller must also ensure compliance to UK data law in safeguarding that data.  

This is a matter of UK sovereignity.  

Patriotism requires compliance.  

Clarity in contracting and effective expectations management from initiation reduces any friction inherent in this process and protects all working parties in the case of any future errors, disputes, or harms.  

### 2. **Additional safeguards.**  
   - Require **technical segregation** of UK‑origin data within joint research systems.  
   - Mandate **audit rights** for the UK controller over any Israeli processing environment that receives UK data.  
   - Include a **re‑transfer prohibition** without explicit written consent.
  
These measures prevent and contain any non-intentional crossover.  

Further, these measures promote good data hygiene practice, which cascades to other areas of compliance and data safeguards.  

If any harms or incidents occur, these measures provide a clear documentation trail to audit when establishing root-causes and analysing any systemic failures.  

### 3. **Equality and perception.**  
For Jewish or Israeli‑heritage data subjects in the UK, these safeguards are not symbolic.

For Palestinian or Palestinian-decendant data subjects in the UK, these safeguards are even more important, due not only to the inherent power imbalance afforded by apratheid, but also the incentive for the Israeli state to permenantly interrupt any legal claim to Palestinian land; the course of conduct of the escalation of the genocide from 2023 onwards, shows what appears to be a structured attempt to erase entire family lineages, as well as whole categories of intellectuals, professionals, and cultural leaders.

This behaviour is not just inherent to genocidal intent and process across time, but also interrupts what is nearly a century of structured legal action from Palestinian individuals and Palestinian civil society as a whole, to seek legal redress under British colonial, Israeli, and international legal systems.  

They ensure that individuals are protected from the structural assumption — common in Israeli state frameworks — that all Jewish data, and all Palestinian data, is automatically part of the Israeli national corpus.  

Failing to implement safeguards can therefore constitute *indirect discrimination* under **s.149 Equality Act 2010**.  

If you need to hear a white British Jew say it, send me a postcard, and I'll put it in writing.  

**You should take even more care about Palestinian and Palestinian-descent data subjects, as they are exposed to and are at active risk of genocide** as per declared provisional measures of the ICJ, and you owe a particular due diligence to **protect them from real-time genocide, both in- and outside the core location of that genocide**.  

The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide holds not just states, but also all levels of society down to private individuals, for the crimes described. This includes but is not limited to material support for those reasonably believed to be perpetrating genocide.  

This is a due diligence issue. It is not rocket science.  

### 4. **Institutional duty.**  
If the MOU or contract does not specify these safeguards, legal counsel for the UK signatory must request amendment or clarification before any data transfer occurs.

The responsibility rests with the UK controller, not with the foreign partner.  

Contract violations and harms may be handled under civil law and torts, respectfully.  

This contributes to predictable precedent for future MOUs with other foreign partners, which reduces global risk index for underwriting and contracting as a whole.

## 🌖 Summary Statement  

Recognising the difference between goodwill and governance is essential.  

Even when collaboration is benign, divergent legal defaults can convert protected UK personal data into state property elsewhere.  

The safeguard is not a judgment about identity: it is a compliance requirement, and a core practice of sovereignity.
