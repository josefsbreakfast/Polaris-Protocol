# 🧬 Classification as Extraction: Recycling Violence Through Governance Systems  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*How data extracted under occupation is recycled into UK governance via classification, misclassification, and dual-use systems.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents a recurring governance pattern:

Violence enacted under conditions of occupation is **extracted as data**,  
abstracted into **classification systems**,  
and later **recycled into Western governance** — including the UK — as neutral optimisation, risk management, or humanitarian expertise.

The violence does not end.  
It is **re-encoded**.

---

## 🔄 The Extraction Loop (End to End)

This is not a metaphorical cycle.  
It is an operational one.

### 1. Occupation as Data Source  
Apartheid and unlawful occupation function as:
- unregulated testing environments,
- population-scale behavioural laboratories,
- zones where consent, rights, and oversight are suspended.

What is extracted is not only surveillance data, but:
- compliance responses,
- movement patterns,
- scarcity behaviour,
- triage outcomes,
- classification stress-tests under coercion.

This is **epistemic extraction**: knowledge gained through domination.

---

### 2. Classification as Sanitisation  
Extracted knowledge is then:
- abstracted into models,
- cleaned of origin conditions,
- reframed as technical insight.

This produces:
- indices,
- risk tiers,
- segmentation frameworks,
- optimisation heuristics.

At this stage, **violence disappears from view**.
What remains is “data”.

Classification is the laundering step.

---

### 3. Dual-Use Translation  
The same classificatory logic is then redeployed as:
- humanitarian logistics,
- migration management,
- labour sorting,
- public-sector efficiency,
- defence-adjacent “resilience”.

This is what “dual use” actually means:
> a single classificatory system justified differently depending on audience.

Aid language for the public.  
Security logic for the state.

---

### 4. Re-import into the UK  
In the UK context, these systems reappear as:
- migration scoring and “talent” frameworks,
- welfare risk assessment,
- NHS triage and resource optimisation,
- counter-extremism proxies,
- crisis governance playbooks.

The population encountering them is no longer Palestinian —  
but the **logic governing them is unchanged**.

---

## ⚠️ Misclassification as Violence Recycling  

The harm is not only classification.  
It is **misclassification**.

Systems trained under coercive conditions:
- over-index on threat,
- collapse nuance,
- mistake distress for risk,
- treat survival behaviour as deviance.

When imported into UK governance, this produces:
- false positives,
- disproportionate targeting,
- procedural cruelty without intent attribution.

Violence returns — not as bombs or checkpoints —  
but as:
- denial,
- delay,
- suspicion,
- administrative erasure.

This is how violence is recycled without being named.

## 🏛️ Why Consultancies Matter (BCG as Structural Actor)

Consultancies like BCG do not merely “apply” these systems.

They:
- define the problem space,
- select the variables,
- validate the classifications,
- render them portable across contexts.

They enable the transition from:
> occupation-specific harm  
to  
> generalisable governance technology.

This is material participation in the recycling loop.

Payment is irrelevant.  
Knowledge extraction is the currency.

---

## 🧠 Why This Degrades Cohesion  

When populations are governed through:
- inherited threat models,
- misapplied classifications,
- optimisation logics born in violence,

trust collapses.

Citizens become:
- data subjects,
- risk profiles,
- managed flows.

Cohesion fails not because people “polarise”,  
but because governance no longer recognises them as full subjects.

---

## 🛑 The Core Claim (Plain Language)

> Occupation produces data through violence.  
> Classification hides that violence.  
> Dual-use systems recycle it.  
> Misclassification re-enacts it.  
> Western governance absorbs it.

This is not accidental.  
It is structural.

*🧬 Classification as Extraction: Recycling Violence Through Governance Systems* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how coercively extracted data and classificatory logics are sanitised, exported, and re-embedded into UK governance, reproducing harm without acknowledging its origin.
