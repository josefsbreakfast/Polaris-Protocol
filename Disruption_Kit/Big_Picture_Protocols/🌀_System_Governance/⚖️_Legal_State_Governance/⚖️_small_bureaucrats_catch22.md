# ⚖️ Small Bureaucrats Catch-22  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Documenting the Catch-22 dynamic of complicit middle-layers and the strategy for targeted resistance.*

---

## 🪼 The Catch-22  
- Survivors need resources to heal and move faster.  
- Resources are locked behind **small bureaucrats at large**: middle-layer actors who were complicit, remain silent, or infantilise survivors.  
- To get help, survivors must push through the very system that injured and exhausted them.  
- This creates a Catch-22: the harder you need help, the less capacity you have to fight for it.  

---

## ❌ Complicit Middle-Layers  
- Refusal to admit complicity.  
- Interest in preserving infantilisation dynamics.  
- Gatekeeping support through opacity, delay, or selective action.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Strategy: Targeted Resistance  
- Survivors cannot dismantle the whole structure at once.  
- Focus pressure on specific cracks where catalyst breakthroughs are possible.  
- Anti-fascist logic: resist in small, deliberate acts until the tipping point.  
- Once a catalyst moment is reached, access to resources improves significantly.

*Small Bureaucrats Catch-22* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how complicit middle-layers create systemic stalemates and how survivors can resist until catalyst moments shift access.
