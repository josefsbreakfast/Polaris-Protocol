# 🏛️ Consultancy Power vs Democratic Safeguards  
**First created:** 2025-08-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*Why large consultancies exist in structural tension with civic law, equality duties, and democratic governance.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines a structural conflict:

Large management consultancies are increasingly embedded in democratic governance — particularly in crisis, migration, and public-sector reform — despite operating under incentive structures that are fundamentally misaligned with civic safeguards.

This is not an argument about intent or ideology.  
It is an argument about **incentives, power, and friction**.

---

## ⚖️ Democratic Safeguards as Designed Friction  

Democratic instruments such as:
- the Equality Act 2010,
- public law duties of reasonableness and proportionality,
- transparency and consultation requirements,

exist **to slow decision-making** where harm is likely.

They are not inefficiencies.
They are *safety mechanisms*.

They prioritise:
- dignity over optimisation,
- inclusion over speed,
- rights over throughput.

---

## 🧠 Consultancy Incentives (Structural, Not Moral)  

Large consultancies are structurally rewarded for:
- speed,
- decisiveness,
- scalability,
- crisis responsiveness,
- measurable outcomes.

Their commercial value increases when:
- governance is framed as emergency,
- consent requirements are relaxed,
- equality assessments are treated as mitigation exercises,
- discretion is widened.

This creates a **persistent incentive mismatch**.

---

## 🧱 Permanent Tension, Not Occasional Conflict  

This tension is not episodic.

It appears wherever consultancies operate in:
- migration governance,
- crisis response,
- public service triage,
- security-adjacent policy,
- population classification systems.

In these domains:
- civic law asks *who is harmed*,
- consultancy logic asks *what works fastest*.

Both cannot govern simultaneously without conflict.

---

## 🚨 Why Normalisation Is the Risk  

The primary risk is not consultancy involvement per se.

It is the **unquestioned normalisation** of that involvement.

When consultancy participation becomes:
- routine,
- assumed,
- structurally embedded,

then:
- emergency logic becomes permanent,
- exceptional measures normalise,
- equality law becomes friction to be managed rather than a governing principle.

This is how democratic erosion occurs **without formal authoritarianism**.

---

## 🛑 Core Claim (Plain Language)

> Consultancies are not anti-democratic actors by intent, but their business models are structurally misaligned with democratic safeguards. Treating them as neutral governance partners without sustained scrutiny creates a long-term risk to equality, accountability, and civic cohesion.
