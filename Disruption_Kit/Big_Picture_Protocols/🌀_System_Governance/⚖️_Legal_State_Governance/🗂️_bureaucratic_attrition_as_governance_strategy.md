# 🗂️ Bureaucratic Attrition as Governance Strategy  
**First created:** 2025-10-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-17  
*When delay and exhaustion become instruments of control.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Examines how administrative systems evolve structures that **reward delay and discourage persistence**.  
Though rarely declared, attrition becomes a silent policy lever: institutions conserve power and resources by outlasting the people who seek accountability.

---

## ✨ Core Dynamics  

1. **Procedural drag** – Each form, resubmission, or verification loop buys time and reduces the claimant pool.  
2. **Fragmented responsibility** – When many offices each hold a fragment of authority, *no one* is accountable for the whole.  
3. **Energy asymmetry** – Staff are paid for every hour spent; citizens spend unpaid time, health, and money.  
4. **Opacity as control** – Vague rules keep discretion inside the system.  
5. **Selective responsiveness** – Urgent cases often get buried first, because they require the most coordination.

## 🧨 Structural Consequence  
Attrition produces apparent legitimacy: the institution can point to “process” while outcomes quietly disappear.  
The most vulnerable — those least able to withstand exhaustion — are filtered out, turning endurance itself into a criterion for access.

## 🐦‍🔥 Counter-Designs  
- Continuous self-documentation to maintain narrative continuity.  
- Mutual witnessing between affected people.  
- Simplified escalation routes and independent ombudsmen.  
- Explicit time limits and auto-escalation triggers for unresolved cases.
