# ⚖️ We Do Have to Prosecute the Elite, Actually

*Why elite non-prosecution is not prudence but democratic self-harm*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node addresses a persistent governance error: the belief that **not prosecuting powerful individuals preserves institutional stability**.  
In practice, elite non-prosecution functions as *risk deferral*, not risk reduction — and the deferred costs compound across trust, legitimacy, and democratic resilience.

This is not a moral argument.  
It is a systems argument.

## 🧿 The Containment Fallacy

Elite non-prosecution is usually justified by some mix of:

- evidential uncertainty  
- cost–benefit analysis  
- reputational risk  
- institutional overload  
- “public interest” calculus  

The shared assumption is that **exposure is more dangerous than silence**.

That assumption is now demonstrably false.

Containment does not resolve systemic harm.  
It **teaches it where the edges are**.

## 🧠 Why “Letting It Go Away” Fails

Suppressing large-scale institutional failure relies on three mistaken beliefs:

1. **That the public cannot tolerate truth**  
2. **That legitimacy comes from stability rather than accountability**  
3. **That harm remains localised if unacknowledged**

Empirically, the opposite is true.

When failures are not named:
- anger does not dissipate — it mutates  
- trust does not stabilise — it fractures  
- responsibility does not vanish — it migrates  

Silence becomes a narrative vacuum.  
Vacuum invites capture.

## 🧩 Gatekeeping Without Villains

Elite enablement rarely requires conspiracy.

It emerges from:
- hierarchy
- deference
- intimidation
- class signalling
- professional risk aversion
- psychological minimisation under power imbalance  

People downplay before they consciously decide to downplay.  
Institutions follow the path of least destabilisation.

This is not individual evil.  
It is **structural gravity**.

---

## ⚠️ Precedent Is a Signal, Not a Footnote

Repeated elite non-prosecution does two things simultaneously:

1. **Signals impunity upward**  
2. **Signals futility downward**

The result is predictable:
- increased risk-taking by the powerful  
- decreased cooperation by the public  
- erosion of equality before the law  

At scale, this is not merely unfair.  
It is **rule-of-law decay**.

## 🔥 Democratic Backblast

When the state fails to prosecute elite wrongdoing:

- legitimate fear (children, women, safety) goes unaddressed  
- trust in institutions collapses  
- bad-faith actors step in to provide answers  

The alt-right did not invent these anxieties.  
They exploited a credibility gap the state created.

This is not culture war fallout.  
It is a **governance failure with security implications**.

---

## 🧮 Why Case-by-Case Costing Breaks at Scale

Cost–benefit analysis assumes:
- cases are independent  
- behaviour does not adapt  
- precedent effects are minimal  

Elite abuse cases violate all three assumptions.

Non-prosecution today:
- raises future offence probability  
- increases future enforcement cost  
- undermines deterrence  
- externalises harm onto victims and society  

The “cheaper” option is simply **delayed payment with interest**.

## 🏛️ Prosecuting Power Is a Public Good

Elite prosecution is not:
- revenge  
- populism  
- symbolic theatre  

It is a **credibility-preserving function of the state**.

Like infrastructure maintenance, it is expensive, disruptive, and politically uncomfortable — and far cheaper than collapse.

The question is not:
> *Can the system afford to prosecute the elite?*

The question is:
> *Can a democracy afford not to?*

*We Do Have to Prosecute the Elite, Actually* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents why elite non-prosecution functions as systemic risk amplification rather than stability management.
