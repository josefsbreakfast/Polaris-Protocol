UK law around keeping animals produces some striking asymmetries. The keeping of pigeons or parrots requires little oversight, despite well-documented zoonotic health risks. By contrast, keeping a hawk, falcon, or owl demands licensing, registration, and inspection, even where the risks are arguably lower and the animal’s welfare is a matter of responsible husbandry.  

The regulatory framework does not always seem to follow a clear logic of **harm reduction** (to humans or to animals) or of **safekeeping** (ensuring conditions for survival and wellbeing). Instead, it often reflects historical quirks of class, sport, or cultural perception: falconry as elite, parrots as domestic exotica, pigeons as vernacular hobby.  

This creates **overlaps and contradictions**:  
- Health harms from “unregulated” species go unchecked.  
- Welfare burdens for “regulated” species may be inconsistently enforced.  
- Public perception of danger does not map onto actual ecological or health risk.  

**Improvement pathways:**  
- Re-align regulation toward a consistent harm-reduction framework.  
- Recognise zoonotic risk (e.g. avian lung disease from pigeons) alongside predatory capacity.  
- Ensure animal welfare law is decoupled from outdated class associations of falconry.  

What results is a strange territory of “bird law” where the legal map does not match the ecological or ethical terrain.

*Bird Law in the UK* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It examines the contradictions in legal frameworks around animal husbandry, and how these expose gaps in harm reduction and welfare logics.
