# 🦮 Who Authorises Animal-Assisted VE Interventions in the UK?  
**First created:** 2025-11-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*A governance-mapping node clarifying which UK actors could legitimately authorise, supervise, or deliver animal-assisted stabilisation work for individuals flagged for vulnerability or early-intervention risk — and why counter‑terrorism bodies are categorically excluded.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
There is persistent confusion about whether animal-assisted comfort or stabilisation activities — including operant conditioning with a person’s own pet — could ever fall under **Prevent**, **counter‑terrorism policing**, or **Home Office operations**.

This node sets out the **only legitimate UK actors** who could authorise such an intervention.  
Spoiler:  
**CT is never one of them.**

Instead, these interventions belong inside **clinical**, **therapeutic**, and **trauma‑informed** environments with robust ethics governance.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Defines which UK bodies *can* authorise animal‑assisted stabilisation work  
- Shows why CT and policing *cannot*  
- Maps required governance structures (ethics, consent, safeguarding)  
- Identifies realistic pathways where VE‑adjacent vulnerability work intersects with AAT

---

## 🐶 Hard Boundary: CT Cannot Authorise or Deliver AAT  
Counter‑terrorism policing, MI5, Home Office CT units, Prevent officers, regional CTUs — **none** of these bodies have:  
- statutory authority  
- ethical frameworks  
- clinical governance  
- training  
- risk licensing  
- or lawful purpose  

…to deliver or authorise animal-assisted therapy, comfort interventions, or behavioural conditioning involving a person’s pet.

AAT sits entirely outside the CT mandate.  
Attempting to perform it would trigger legal and safeguarding alarms.

## 🐕‍🦺 The Only UK Actors Who *Can* Authorise Animal-Assisted Interventions  

### **A. NHS & Specialist Trauma Services**  
The NHS is the primary lawful environment for any animal‑assisted clinical intervention.  
Authorisation may come from:  
- NHS Trust clinical governance boards  
- trauma service leads  
- CAMHS service managers  
- psychological therapies teams  
- clinical psychologists with AAT training  
- occupational therapists (OTs) with AAI certification  

Requirements:  
- consent  
- risk assessment  
- ethics compliance  
- data minimisation  
- safeguarding plan

---

### **B. AAT‑Certified Practitioners & Organisations**  
Animal-Assisted Therapy in the UK requires:  
- practitioner training  
- animal welfare certification  
- organisational membership (e.g., Professional Association for AAT)  
- safeguarding clearances  
- insurance and liability cover  

These practitioners can deliver interventions only with:  
- participant consent  
- clear therapeutic goals  
- governance from their host organisation  

They cannot be subcontracted by policing or CT bodies to perform covert functions.

---

### **C. University‑Based Clinical Research Teams**  
Legitimate AAT-involved research sits inside:  
- university psychology departments  
- applied behavioural science labs  
- trauma and attachment research units  
- human–animal interaction studies  

Any intervention requires:  
- ethics committee approval  
- participant consent  
- anonymisation protocols  
- welfare checks for the animal and human  
- non‑coercive participation  

This is sometimes where AAT overlaps with VE vulnerability work, because universities run early‑intervention research with distressed young people.

---

### **D. Third‑Sector Youth Support & Trauma-Focused Charities**  
Some organisations may include animals informally within:  
- youth counselling  
- mentoring schemes  
- vulnerability support programmes  
- trauma-informed outreach  

Only if:  
- activities are consent-based  
- not covert  
- not framed as “deradicalisation”  
- delivered by trained staff or volunteers  
- not directed by policing agencies

---

## 🧿 Where VE/Extremism Vulnerability Comes Into This  
UK systems treat VE risk primarily as **a safeguarding matter**, not a behavioural prediction problem.

Thus, young people flagged under “vulnerability to radicalisation” may also be:  
- distressed  
- traumatised  
- isolated  
- dysregulated  

AAT becomes relevant only insofar as it:  
- improves emotional regulation  
- supports therapeutic engagement  
- stabilises the nervous system  
- reduces panic-driven withdrawal  

This is **adjacency**, not CT strategy.

---

## 🖋️ The Governance Stack (Who Must Sign Off)  
For any animal-assisted intervention to be lawful and ethical, the following must be present:

- ✓ **Consent**  
- ✓ **Safeguarding oversight**  
- ✓ **Clinical governance**  
- ✓ **Risk assessment**  
- ✓ **Data privacy protections**  
- ✓ **Animal welfare scrutiny**  
- ✓ **Clear therapeutic objective**  
- ✓ **Ethics board approval** (for research)

No CT body has access to this governance stack.  
Hence: **they cannot authorise it.**

---

## 📜 Indicators an Intervention is Legitimate  
A legitimate AAI/VE‑adjacent intervention will have:

- clear documentation  
- a named clinician or researcher  
- written consent  
- welfare plans for the animal  
- structured session goals  
- transparent data processes  
- no covert elements  
- no security vocabulary  
- no unannounced home entry  
- no blurring of policing vs care roles

Anything that deviates from this is **not** an authorised AAT pathway.
