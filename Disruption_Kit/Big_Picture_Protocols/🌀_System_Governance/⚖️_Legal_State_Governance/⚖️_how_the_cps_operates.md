# ⚖️ How the CPS Operates  
**First created:** 2025-12-20 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-05  
*What prosecutorial independence really means, where discretion lives, and how decisions are quietly shaped.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node explains how the **Crown Prosecution Service** (CPS) actually functions in England and Wales — not in theory, but in practice.

It exists to clarify:
- what the CPS can and cannot do
- where decisions are formally made
- where influence enters without overt instruction
- why elite cases behave differently without requiring corruption

This is a wiring diagram, not a defence.

## ⚖️ The Two-Stage Test (The Spine of Everything)

Every CPS charging decision applies a mandatory two-stage test:

### 1. Evidential Stage  
Is there a **realistic prospect of conviction** based on admissible evidence?

This is not “more likely than not”.
It is closer to: *Would a properly directed jury be more likely than not to convict?*

Historic abuse cases face structural evidential drag:
- delayed reporting
- deceased suspects or witnesses
- lost or degraded records
- credibility attacks on complainants
- power-asymmetric narratives

### 2. Public Interest Stage  
If evidential sufficiency is met, is prosecution **in the public interest**?

This stage is where discretion lives.

## 🧮 What “Public Interest” Actually Includes

CPS guidance lists multiple factors, including:

- seriousness of the offence  
- harm to victims  
- age and health of the suspect  
- deterrent value  
- proportionality  
- **resource impact and opportunity cost**

That last factor is often minimised in public explanation — but it is real.

The CPS operates under:
- finite budgets
- staffing limits
- political scrutiny
- performance metrics

Public interest is therefore **not a moral absolute**.
It is an institutional optimisation function.

---

## 🧠 Independence Is Real — and Limited

The CPS is **statutorily independent**.

This means:
- no minister can lawfully order a prosecution or non-prosecution
- the monarch has no legal authority over charging decisions
- individual cases cannot be vetoed by political actors

But independence does **not** mean isolation.

---

## 🧩 Where Influence Enters (Without Orders)

Influence operates upstream and ambiently:

### 1. Guidance and Priorities  
The Attorney General:
- issues high-level guidance
- sets strategic priorities
- shapes institutional risk appetite

They cannot direct cases — but they shape the terrain cases move through.

### 2. Anticipatory Deference  
Senior prosecutors internalise:
- constitutional sensitivity
- reputational fallout
- likelihood of hostile media or political response

No one needs to say “don’t prosecute”.
The system learns what outcomes are costly.

### 3. Risk Asymmetry  
Elite defendants introduce:
- stronger defence teams
- longer proceedings
- higher appeal risk
- greater institutional embarrassment if acquitted

This shifts the *evidential confidence threshold* in practice, even if not on paper.

## 🏛️ Why Elite Cases Behave Differently

Elite cases are not blocked by status alone.
They are filtered by **risk aggregation**.

From the CPS perspective, such cases are:
- slower
- more resource-intensive
- more adversarial
- more reputationally volatile
- more likely to fail publicly

The public interest test therefore tilts *against* prosecution — not because the offence is minor, but because the system is risk-averse.

This is how lawful discretion produces unlawful outcomes at scale.

---

## ⚠️ The Structural Weak Point

The CPS model assumes:
- cases are independent
- precedent effects are limited
- non-prosecution does not alter future behaviour

In elite offending, all three assumptions fail.

Repeated non-prosecution:
- teaches impunity upward
- erodes trust downward
- increases future enforcement cost
- undermines deterrence

At that point, the CPS is no longer just triaging cases.
It is shaping the moral economy of the law.

---

## 🔄 Why Reviews and Inquiries Replace Charges

When prosecution is deemed too risky, systems default to:
- internal reviews
- public inquiries
- policy reform language
- “lessons learned” frameworks

These mechanisms:
- absorb public anger
- protect institutional legitimacy
- avoid adversarial fact-finding
- distribute blame thinly

They are governance tools — not accountability tools.

---

## 🧠 What This Node Is *Not* Saying

This analysis does **not** claim:
- prosecutors act in bad faith
- decisions are centrally coordinated
- corruption is required for failure

It shows how:
> a rational, professional, lawful system  
> can repeatedly produce unjust outcomes  
> without anyone breaking the rules.
