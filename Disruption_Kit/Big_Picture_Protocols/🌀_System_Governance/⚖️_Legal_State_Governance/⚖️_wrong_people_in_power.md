*Why suppression operations persist when the authorising class is compromised or unwilling.*

---

## 🛰️ Situation  
- Suppression operations seeded in past decades are now mature.  
- At least two major powers are impacted.  
- Oversight bodies reluctant to act because:  
  - They are themselves implicated.  
  - They still rely on suppression tools.  
  - They fear political fallout.  

---

## 🏛️ Problems of Will  
- Refusal to disclose holdings.  
- Reluctance to process sensitive data.  
- Refusal to unwind tools still in use.  
- Political investment in maintaining cover.  

---

## ⚖️ Strategic Framing  
When authorising classes are both **beneficiaries and gatekeepers**, self-exposure becomes near impossible.  
This creates a cycle of **inaction by design** — accountability blocked not by capacity but by conflict of interest.  
The result: suppression persists *not because it works*, but because those with power are unwilling to risk the truth.
