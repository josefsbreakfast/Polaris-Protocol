# 🧨 The Schmittian Drift in Exceptional Detention Governance  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*How emergency logic becomes ordinary governance — and why pretrial hunger strike crises expose this drift.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Carl Schmitt argued that the sovereign is the one who decides the exception.  
Liberal democracy, by contrast, relies on limiting the exception and embedding decision-making inside procedure, evidence, and judicial oversight.

When exceptional powers become routine — particularly in contexts involving unconvicted detainees — governance begins to drift toward Schmitt’s model: the exception starts to define the norm.

The hunger strikes associated with Palestine Action, occurring under pretrial detention with counter-terrorism framing, reveal this drift with unusual clarity.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Defines Schmittian drift as the normalisation of emergency logic.  
- Shows how exceptional detention becomes standard practice.  
- Uses hunger strikes to illustrate constitutional stress points.  
- Maps the democratic risks of normalised exception.  

---

## 🪼 What Schmittian Drift Looks Like  
Schmitt’s sovereign claims legitimacy by determining when the law is suspended.  
In liberal democracy, the opposite contract exists: legality restrains the sovereign.

Schmittian drift occurs when:

- emergency powers persist beyond emergency conditions,  
- classification replaces evidence,  
- suspicion replaces charge,  
- security rationales replace judicial scrutiny,  
- pretrial exceptionalism becomes indistinguishable from punishment.

This drift is structural, not necessarily intentional.

---

## 🪹 Pretrial Detention as the New Exception  
Pretrial detention under security framing is one of the clearest theatres of Schmittian drift.

It allows the state to:

- impose deprivation without conviction,  
- restrict rights before guilt is established,  
- exert coercive power on the basis of anticipated risk,  
- and sidestep the temporal protections of trial.

When prolonged, it transforms the meaning of innocence itself.

---

## 🍉 Case Example: Palestine Action Hunger Strikes  
The detainees are:

- legally innocent,  
- held under counter-terrorism policing context,  
- alleged to have committed no harm-to-persons offences,  
- in protracted remand,  
- and now experiencing medical deterioration.

This creates a Schmittian inversion:

> **The exception (counter-terrorism logic) becomes the governing logic for ordinary criminal allegations.**

The body’s deterioration exposes the oversight vacuum:  
exceptional power is operating without exceptional justification.

---

## 🥀 Drift as a Governance Vulnerability  
Schmittian drift erodes:

- judicial independence,  
- presumption of innocence,  
- procedural legitimacy,  
- trust in proportionality,  
- and the distinction between punishment and pretrial containment.

This produces democratic brittleness.  
A state that normalises exception does not become stronger — it becomes structurally reactive.

---

## 🍄 Why Hunger Strikes Reveal the Drift  
Refusal collapses the ambiguity.

A hunger strike:

- forces a timeline the state cannot control,  
- exposes contradictions between legality and practice,  
- makes exceptionalism visible through the body,  
- and reveals that the state cannot meaningfully distinguish between “suspect” and “convict.”

Bodies become diagnostic instruments.  
The crisis reveals where exception logic has quietly replaced the rule of law.

---

## 🌊 Long-Term Constitutional Risk  
When exceptional logic governs the legally innocent, democratic systems move closer to the threshold where:

- human rights obligations appear “incompatible,”  
- supranational constraints (e.g., ECHR) feel restrictive,  
- and political justification begins to shift towards exit rather than compliance.

This is not a prediction — it is a mapping of incentive structures.  
Schmittian drift makes rights look optional.
