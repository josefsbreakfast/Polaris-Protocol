## 🛰️ Orientation
Harm assessment is the bridge between internal process review and external remediation.

This node documents how institutions determine:
- whether harm occurred  
- its scope  
- and appropriate response  

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Impact-focused analysis  
- Distinction between error and harm  
- Documentation-heavy evaluation  
- Risk-calibrated response planning  

---

## Impact Identification
Institutions assess:
- distress  
- reputational damage  
- procedural disadvantage  
- financial cost  
- prolonged uncertainty  

---

## Causality Mapping
They connect harm to process failure, not personal blame.

---

## Threshold Decision
A determination is made:
> “This warrants remediation.”

---

## Response Calibration
Remediation is matched to scope of harm.

---

## 🌌 Constellations
📜 ⚖️ 🧠 🧩 — documentation, law, cognition, impact mapping.

---

## ✨ Stardust
harm assessment, institutional liability, impact evaluation, remediation thresholds
