*How watching at sea became a choice — and why non-intervention hardened into acceptance.*

## 🧭 What this node is
This node examines maritime non-intervention during the Gaza crisis as a **clear instance of preventability refused**.

It focuses on:
- civilian flotilla attempts,
- the naval blockade,
- ISR-only maritime presence,
- and the refusal to facilitate or enforce humanitarian access.

This is not a symbolic episode.  
It is a **doctrinally clean case**.

---

## ⚓ Blockade law (plain language)
A naval blockade is only lawful if:

- it is proportionate,
- it allows humanitarian access,
- and it does not cause starvation of civilians.

Once starvation risk is foreseeable, **third states acquire duties**:
- not to assist the blockade’s unlawful effects,
- and to facilitate relief where capacity exists.

Blockade legality is **conditional**, not permanent.

---

## 🗓️ The flotilla moment
By early 2024:

- famine risk was publicly identified,
- land crossings were inadequate and restricted,
- civilian actors sought maritime delivery of aid,
- docking was refused by the blockading power.

At the same time:
- allied states maintained maritime and aerial ISR presence,
- described explicitly as **non-SAR and non-humanitarian**.

This is the moment that matters.

---

## 🛰️ ISR-only presence is not neutral
Maintaining ISR-only maritime assets communicates:

- awareness of conditions,
- capacity to observe and verify,
- and deliberate abstention from facilitation.

Once harm is foreseeable, observation without action becomes **acquiescence**.

This is not ignorance.
This is **choice under visibility**.

---

## 🚫 Docking refusal + observation = acceptance
The combination of:

- blocked humanitarian docking,
- known starvation risk,
- and continued third-state observation,

creates a closed loop:

1. Harm is visible.
2. Access is denied.
3. Capacity to assist exists.
4. Assistance is withheld.

At that point, non-intervention is no longer passive.

---

## ⚖️ Why this matters legally
Maritime non-intervention strengthens claims of:

- failure to prevent prohibited outcomes,
- aiding by omission,
- and tolerance of unlawful blockade effects.

Unlike arms transfers or intelligence sharing, this case does not rely on inference.

The harm, capacity, and refusal are **co-located in time and space**.

---

## 🧠 Why states prefer maritime distance
States avoid maritime intervention because:

- it is visible,
- it is difficult to reframe as “technical,”
- and it forces confrontation rather than management.

ISR-only presence preserves:
- deniability,
- alliance comfort,
- and narrative control.

At the cost of prevention.

---

## 🧯 Downstream effects
- Starvation risk becomes normalised as “access difficulty.”
- Legal duties are reframed as discretionary.
- Maritime law credibility erodes.
- Prevention is replaced by monitoring.
- Non-intervention sets precedent for future sieges.

---

## 🧷 Working claim
The flotilla episode marks the point where:

- knowledge was complete,
- capacity was present,
- and non-intervention was explicit.

From that moment, maritime neutrality ceased to exist.

*🚢 Flotilla, Blockade, And Maritime Non-Intervention* is a supporting case-study node in the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to show how prevention can fail **in full view**, and why watching from the waterline without acting converts neutrality into acceptance.
