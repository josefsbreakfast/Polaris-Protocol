# 🔥 When Law Has Collapsed into Power  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*A practical checklist for identifying the threshold where legality yields to coercive power in policing practice.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

In healthy systems, law constrains power.

In failing systems, power quietly replaces law — not through formal declaration, but through everyday decision-making under pressure.

This checklist is designed to help identify the **threshold moment** when policing practice stops being governed primarily by legality and becomes governed by:
- manageability,
- fear,
- escalation calculus,
- and political pressure.

It is intended for use by:
- oversight bodies,
- journalists,
- legal observers,
- internal reformers,
- civil society monitors.

This tool diagnoses **conditions**, not intent.

---

## ✨ How to Use This Checklist  

- This is not a binary test.  
- No single indicator is decisive.  
- Look for **convergence** across categories.  

When multiple indicators are present simultaneously, law has likely collapsed into power **in practice**, even if it remains intact on paper.

---

## ⚖️ Indicator Set 1: Enforcement Driven by Manageability, Not Legality  

Check whether enforcement decisions are justified primarily by:
- available staffing rather than legal obligation,
- likelihood of resistance rather than severity of harm,
- ease of processing rather than proportionality.

Red flags include:
- “We can’t deal with that right now.”
- “It would take too many resources.”
- “We’re focusing on what we can manage.”

**Signal:**  
Law is being subordinated to capacity constraints.

---

## 🔥 Indicator Set 2: Escalation Rewarded with Avoidance  

Observe whether actors who:
- escalate confrontation,
- threaten violence or litigation,
- create procedural obstruction,

are met with:
- de-escalation through non-enforcement,
- informal accommodation,
- delayed or dropped action.

Meanwhile, compliant or vulnerable individuals face swift enforcement.

**Signal:**  
Power is teaching institutions that intimidation works.

---

## 🧿 Indicator Set 3: Symbolic Enforcement  

Look for enforcement that:
- targets visible but low-risk individuals,
- focuses on speech or symbolism over capability or harm,
- prioritises optics and “sending a message”.

Common signs:
- arrests unlikely to reduce actual threat,
- emphasis on performative legality,
- disproportionate action against those least able to resist.

**Signal:**  
Enforcement is being used to perform authority, not uphold law.

---

## 😨 Indicator Set 4: Fear-Based Discretion  

Pay attention to whether officers:
- express fear of enforcing law against specific actors,
- avoid cases perceived as dangerous to career or safety,
- rely on informal warnings rather than formal process.

This may be framed as:
- “common sense”,
- “risk management”,
- or “officer safety”.

**Signal:**  
Fear is shaping discretion more than legality.

---

## 🧠 Reading the Threshold  

When these indicators cluster:
- legality becomes optional,
- equality before the law erodes,
- and coercive power fills the gap.

This is the practical enactment of the **exception**:
law exists, but does not decide.

---

## 🚦 What This Checklist Does — and Does Not — Do  

This tool:
- does **not** accuse individuals,
- does **not** require proof of ideology,
- does **not** replace legal judgment.

It **does**:
- name a dangerous shift,
- justify deeper scrutiny,
- and counter claims that outcomes are merely “operational”.

*🔥 When Law Has Collapsed into Power (Checklist)* is a diagnostic tool within the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It provides a clear, pattern-based method for identifying when policing practice has crossed from legal governance into coercive power management.
