# 🦾 Stronghold Capture Audit — Party Realignment in Safe Seats  
**First created:** 2025-10-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Examining where party brand stability masks shifts in ideology, candidate profile, or local representation.*  

---

## 🛰️ Scope  
This audit tracks constituencies or wards where a party—typically a long-standing incumbent—  
1. **Retained or regained control**, but  
2. Installed a **candidate with materially different politics, funding links, or local engagement history.**

It provides a repeatable framework for assessing whether *party dominance* is being used to bypass genuine local consent.

## 🪑 Pattern Overview — The “Safe Seat Substitution”  
| Mechanism | Description | Observable Signals |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Brand Reliance** | Party assumes electorate votes by colour, not candidate. | Minimal local campaigning. |
| **Parachute Candidate** | External figure placed for profile or loyalty, not roots. | Address mismatch, HQ-managed comms. |
| **Ideological Drift** | Candidate differs markedly from predecessor. | Sharp tone change in voting record. |
| **Organisational Capture** | Local selections steered by HQ or lobby. | Deselection disputes, imposed shortlists. |
| **Data-Led Framing** | Messaging built from national data, not local needs. | Repetition of national slogans. |

## 🤔 Analytical Layers  
### 1️⃣ Candidate Provenance  
- Source candidate bios, employment, and donation history.  
- FOI or public inquiries into selection process transparency.  

### 2️⃣ Issue Mismatch  
- Compare candidate focus vs. top local issues in press or consultations.  

### 3️⃣ Demographics  
- Use ONS data to measure how representative candidate positions are to local socio-economic profile.  

### 4️⃣ Financial or Organisational Ties  
- Examine donations and think-tank or corporate affiliations.  

### 5️⃣ Behavioural Targeting Indicators  
- Analyse digital-ad tone; cross-match vendors active in multiple “safe seat” zones.
