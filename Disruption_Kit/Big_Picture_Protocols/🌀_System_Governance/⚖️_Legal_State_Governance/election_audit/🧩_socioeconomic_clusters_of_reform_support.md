# 🧩 Socio-Economic Clusters of Reform Support (UK Local Elections)  
**First created:** 2025-10-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Mapping recurring local conditions where new-right and anti-establishment parties gained council seats, 2023–2024.*  

---

## Scope  
This node examines the **recurring socio-economic patterns** in towns and districts where Reform UK and similar parties gained local-election traction.  
It focuses on *material conditions* and *governance neglect* rather than ideology—asking why the same civic wounds re-appear in different geographies.

---

## Core Pattern — The Neglect Loop  
1. **Industrial and retail collapse:** de-industrialised towns, hollowed-out manufacturing bases, and persistent high-street closures.  
2. **Low employability and stalled mobility:** skills mismatch, zero-hours labour, and minimal adult-education infrastructure.  
3. **Perceived civic abandonment:** visible decline in services (bus routes, GP access, policing) → narrative of “no one listens.”  
4. **Community fracture and substitute belonging:** temporary accommodation or hotel use for housing overflow creates friction; local clubs and pubs closed.  
5. **Narrative capture:** external actors offer a *simple storyline*—“the elites did this”—which feels truer than decades of bureaucratic neglect.

## Analytical Axes  
| Axis | Typical Indicator | Example Open Source |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Economic Decline | Falling median income, shop-vacancy rate > 20 % | ONS, Local Data Company |
| Service Attrition | Reduction in bus routes, GP coverage, or youth centres | Council minutes, NHS Digital |
| Demographic Stability | Ageing population, low in-migration | ONS Census |
| Digital Echo Density | High Facebook/Telegram group activity | CrowdTangle, public search |
| Boundary or Ward Change | Redraw coinciding with regeneration promise | Boundary Commission |
| Narrative Tone | “Protect”, “Take Back”, “Forgotten Towns” | Ad libraries, leaflet archives |

## Interpretation  
The pattern is not a surprise and not confined to one party: **systemic neglect breeds counter-system movements**.  
When civic infrastructure erodes, *identity economics* replaces material politics.  
Where mainstream parties treat these regions as safe or unwinnable, new entrants occupy the vacuum.

## Open-Source Audit Pointers  
1. **Compile seat-gain list** from Electoral Commission local-election data.  
2. **Join** with ONS deprivation and business-closure datasets.  
3. **Add** indicators: youth-service budgets, transport frequency, housing affordability.  
4. **Cross-reference** with ad-library and social-media data.  
5. **Visualise** using the Citizen Audit CSV template.

## Policy Relevance  
- **For journalists:** storyboards of place-based neglect.  
- **For councils:** diagnostic for regeneration.  
- **For regulators:** early-warning system for data-driven populism.
