# 🧠 Citizen Audit — Behavioural Data in Elections  
**First created:** 2025-10-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*A field-ready OSINT template for journalists, researchers, and local citizens to examine data use and behavioural targeting in UK elections.*  

---

## 🛰️ Scope  
This node offers a practical framework for **open-source auditing of electoral data use**.  
It outlines how to combine FOI requests, public datasets, and local observations to identify where **behavioural micro-targeting**, **boundary manipulation**, or **data-driven campaigning** may have shaped electoral outcomes.  

The aim is civic literacy, not accusation: a transparent citizen tool that strengthens democratic resilience by mapping patterns, overlaps, and anomalies.

---

## 🏛️ Step 1 — Establish Your Baseline  
### 🗳️ Electoral Registers  
- **FOI/Access:** Request local Electoral Registration Officer or council for open electoral register access policy.  
- **Ask:** Who has purchased or accessed the register for research, commercial, or political use in the past five years?  
- **Compare:** Changes in access policies or licensing fees over time.

### 🧾 Boundary Changes  
- **FOI/Access:** Boundary Commission or local authority.  
- **Ask:** Rationale for changes, data used to justify redrawing, consultation submissions.  
- **Map:** Where new ward or constituency boundaries coincide with major demographic shifts or regeneration projects.

### 💷 Campaign Spend Returns  
- **Source:** Electoral Commission register.  
- **Check:** Declared spending on digital, consultancy, and data analytics.  
- **Cross-match:** Vendors’ Companies House records (ownership, overseas links).

## 🗺️ Step 2 — Map Local Targeting & Candidate Changes  
1. **Seat Gains and Swings:** Identify where parties campaigned hardest for gains; compare declared spend vs. voter turnout.  
2. **Candidate Replacement Patterns:** Track areas with sudden candidate turnover before or after boundary changes.  
3. **Issue Clustering:** Review campaign literature, local press, and social media ads to see which *issues* were foregrounded.  
4. **Social Correlation:** Overlay local deprivation indices, demographics, and digital-infrastructure coverage.

## 🧠 Step 3 — Behavioural and Platform Layer  
| Layer | What to Check | Open Sources |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Digital ads** | Which themes ran in your area? | Meta Ad Library, Google Ads Transparency, Who Targets Me plugin |
| **Consultancies / Agencies** | Who provided data analysis, messaging, or nudge design? | Companies House, LinkedIn, OpenCorporates |
| **Data Infrastructure** | Where are these firms hosted or incorporated? | WHOIS, company filings |
| **Foreign Links** | Any overseas shareholders, parent companies, or cloud processing outside UK? | Companies House PSC data, NSI filings |

---

## 🧿 Step 4 — Pattern Recognition  
Look for clusters where three or more of the following coincide:  
1. Recent **boundary change** or **seat gain**.  
2. Presence of **behavioural-consultancy vendor** with foreign ownership or opaque structure.  
3. Local **issue amplification** (e.g. fear-based or identity-based messaging).  
4. **Anomalous spending ratios** — high digital ad spend vs. physical campaigning.  
5. Sudden **turnout drop or spike** unexplained by demographics.  

Plot these on a map or spreadsheet; even rough visuals can reveal systemic targeting corridors.

---

## 🐝 Step 5 — Ethical & Legal Boundaries  
- **No doxxing or personal-data publication.** Work only with *aggregate* or *publicly available* data.  
- **Transparency > accusation.** Your goal is to *show patterns*, not claim intent.  
- **Data minimisation.** If you create local datasets, strip identifiers before sharing.  
- **Cite sources.** Keep FOI responses, screenshots, and URLs for reproducibility.

---

## 🪄 Step 6 — Sharing & Escalation  
1. **Publish locally:** through community newsletters or regional media.  
2. **Collaborate:** with open-data groups, journalists’ networks, or civic labs.  
3. **Notify regulators:** if you find strong evidence of undeclared analytics or possible foreign links.  
4. **Archive:** use decentralised repositories (GitHub, DocumentCloud) to preserve findings.
