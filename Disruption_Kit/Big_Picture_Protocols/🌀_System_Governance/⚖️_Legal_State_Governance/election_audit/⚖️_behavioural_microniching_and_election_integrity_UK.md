# ‚öñÔ∏è Behavioural Microniching & Electoral Integrity (UK)  
**First created:** 2025-10-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Mapping what‚Äôs ‚Äúin-bounds‚Äù and ‚Äúout-of-bounds‚Äù in UK behavioural targeting law, using a cricket-field metaphor for clarity.*  

---

## Scope  
This node defines the **legal and ethical perimeter** for behavioural insights and micro-targeting within UK political campaigns.  
It draws on electoral, data-protection, and communications law to distinguish between lawful persuasion and manipulative influence.

## Field Map ‚Äî The Cricket Metaphor  

| Zone | Description | Legal Status |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| üü¢ **In-Bounds** | Lawful use of voter data, transparent imprints, declared spending. | Permitted. |
| üü† **Grey Zone** | Non-sensitive inferred traits or psychological cues used in ads. | Legally allowed, ethically risky. |
| üî¥ **Out-of-Bounds** | Unlawful personal-data use, dark ads, undeclared funding, foreign routing. | Prohibited. |

---

## In-Bounds (Legal & Permitted)  
1. **Targeted persuasion using lawful data:** open register, canvass returns, census data, consented analytics.  
2. **Behavioural nudges without sensitive data:** framing, social proof, turnout encouragement.  
3. **Digital imprints:** Elections Act 2022 mandates disclosure of who paid for or promoted online political content.  
4. **Declared donations:** transparent reporting via Electoral Commission.  

---

## Grey Zone (Playable, but Sensitive)  
- Psychographic segmentation using inferred traits from public data.  
- Look-alike audiences without explicit consent but without sensitive data fields.  
- Emotionally charged framing that may distort voter perception without lying outright.  

Regulators tolerate this, but **risk increases** with opacity and manipulative tone.

---

## Out-of-Bounds (Illegal / High-Risk)  
1. **Sensitive data misuse:** race, religion, political opinions processed without lawful basis (UK GDPR breach).  
2. **Dark ads:** targeted online content lacking imprints (Elections Act 2022 breach).  
3. **Foreign or undeclared funding:** PPERA offence.  
4. **Turnout suppression or intimidation:** corrupt practice under RPA 1983 s.115.  
5. **Automated manipulation:** bots, deepfakes, or deceptive mass messaging without consent (PECR & Comms Act breaches).

## Watchdogs & Oversight Bodies  
| Regulator | Domain | Powers |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Electoral Commission** | Spending, donations, digital imprints | Investigatory & fining powers |
| **ICO** | Data protection, profiling, consent | Enforcement notices, audits |
| **ASA** | Non-party issue advertising | Limited scope for deception |
| **NCSC / DCMS** | Cyber and infrastructure security | Advisory |

---

## Practical Compliance Checklist  
‚úÖ Declare your data sources and lawful basis (UK GDPR).  
‚úÖ Ensure all online material includes a visible imprint (Elections Act 2022).  
‚úÖ Avoid sensitive-category profiling without explicit consent.  
‚úÖ Maintain audit logs of campaign vendors and datasets.  
‚úÖ Disclose any overseas cloud or processing arrangements.  

---

## Policy Direction  
Future reform is likely to centre on **algorithmic transparency** and **cross-regulator cooperation**.  
Both the ICO and Electoral Commission have called for clearer powers to inspect targeting systems used in campaigns.

*Behavioural Micro-Targeting & Electoral Integrity (UK)* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It codifies the lawful boundaries of digital campaigning and the regulatory field conditions for transparent persuasion.
