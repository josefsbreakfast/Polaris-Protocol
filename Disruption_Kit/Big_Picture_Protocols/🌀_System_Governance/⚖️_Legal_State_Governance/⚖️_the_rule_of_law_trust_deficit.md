# ⚖️ The Rule-of-Law Trust Deficit
**First created:** 2025-10-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*Governance analysis of unequal terrorism classification and its effect on public legitimacy.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
When protest slogans are criminalised as terrorism while arson at a mosque is not, the public no longer understands the law’s boundaries.  
This node traces the governance risk of that confusion: erosion of trust, decay of democratic consent, and loss of the social-contract “herd immunity” that keeps law legitimate.

## ✨ Analysis  

1. **Public dissonance**  
   - Citizens cannot parse why similar acts carry opposing legal labels.  
   - Perceived arbitrariness breeds cynicism: if justice is politicised, compliance becomes optional.  

2. **The trust-immunity model**  
   - Like vaccination, legitimacy requires majority buy-in.  
   - Below a threshold of public belief in fairness, enforcement ceases to function.  

3. **Operational opacity**  
   - Classification decisions are rarely explained; communities rely on leaks and inference.  
   - Absence of reasoning fuels conspiracy, not order.  

4. **Governance remedy**  
   - Statutory duty to publish terrorism-classification rationale (yes or no) within 30 days of any ideologically motivated incident.  
   - Independent oversight panel including cross-faith and civil-rights representatives.
