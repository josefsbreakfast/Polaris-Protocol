# 💀 Prison Deaths Look Bad at the ICJ  
**First created:** 2025-12-17 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*Domestic acceptance of foreseeable custodial death corrodes a state’s credibility in genocide-prevention litigation.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines how **contemporary custodial deaths — or the conscious acceptance of their risk — weaken a state’s credibility** when appearing before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), particularly in cases concerning the duty to prevent genocide.

It does not argue that prison deaths create automatic international liability. It documents how they **damage good-faith posture, evidentiary weight, and prevention claims**.

---

## Genocide Law Is About Prevention, Not Intent  
Under settled ICJ jurisprudence (notably *Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro*), responsibility for genocide-related breaches does **not** require intent to destroy a group.

It requires:
- Knowledge of a serious risk  
- Capacity to influence or restrain  
- Failure to act with due diligence  

Credibility in prevention therefore matters.

---

## Domestic Conduct as Credibility Evidence  
When a state claims internationally that it:
- Takes civilian death seriously  
- Acts early to prevent foreseeable harm  
- Prioritises life under security pressure  

its **domestic conduct under stress becomes probative**.

If, contemporaneously, the same state:
- Knows a prisoner faces a serious risk of death  
- Receives medical advice to intervene  
- Has the capacity to prevent harm  
- And chooses restraint or delay  

then its assurances of preventive vigilance weaken.

---

## Risk Acceptance as a Pattern  
The issue is not a single death. It is **decision logic**.

Where a state demonstrates that:
- Lethal risk is tolerated when politically costly  
- Fallout is managed rather than harm prevented  
- Oversight is resisted once narratives harden  

opposing parties can argue that the state normalises preventable death under pressure.

That argument directly undermines claims of good faith in genocide-prevention contexts.

---

## Why the ICJ Notices This  
The ICJ does not rule in a vacuum. It evaluates:
- Whether a state *acts like* a prevention-oriented actor  
- Whether assurances are borne out by behaviour  
- Whether “we would intervene if risk were real” is credible  

A state that accepts foreseeable death in custody provides **contemporary counter-evidence** against its own claims.

---

## What This Does *Not* Do  
- It does **not** establish genocide liability  
- It does **not** prove complicity  
- It does **not** substitute for factual findings in the principal case  

It **does**:
- Weaken evidentiary posture  
- Undermine moral authority  
- Strengthen arguments of selective restraint  
- Support claims of prevention failure as a structural issue
