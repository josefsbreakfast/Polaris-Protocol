**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*How cumulative crises since 2008 hollowed governance and expanded reliance on fixers and shadow networks.*

---

## 🤑 1. 2008 — Financial Crash  
- Collapse of banking stability revealed fragility of globalised finance.  
- State response: bailouts + austerity.  
- Public infrastructure weakened, criminal and grey networks filled gaps.  

---

## 🏝️ 2. 2016 — Brexit  
- Major economic and political shock.  
- Government energy consumed by internal fights and negotiations.  
- Reliance on lobbyists, contractors, and influence networks deepened.  
- Space widened for “fixers” to broker outcomes outside formal governance.  

---

## 🦠 3. 2020 — Pandemic  
- Global shutdown exposed brittleness of systems.  
- Emergency procurement and crisis response produced opportunities for profiteering.  
- Grift industries flourished: contractors, intermediaries, grey operators.  
- Governments increasingly dependent on networks with capacity, not legitimacy.  

---

## 🪼 4. 2025 — Present Moment  
- After successive shocks, governance capacity is thin.  
- Formal institutions defer to shadow networks for crisis management.  
- Appears as **“shadow governance”** — not from one source, but as an **industry of fixers**.  
- What began as crisis management has hardened into structural dependency.  

---

## 🔥 5. Pattern  
- Each crisis dug the hole deeper.  
- Shadow governance is not conspiracy but **grift economy**: opportunists who thrive where state capacity is eroded.  
- The timeline shows how suppression, corruption, and criminal intermediaries became normalised tools of government survival.  

**This is almost never about one party or one actor or one vector.**  
This is often a side-effect of crisis, and the human temptation of easy fixes for complicated needs.
