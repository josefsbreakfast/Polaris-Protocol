**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-17  
*What institutions do after recognising procedural failure.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
After realisation, institutions enter a stabilisation cycle focused on risk containment, record correction, and forward protection.

This phase is quiet, procedural, and slow.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Backward reconstruction of decisions  
- Scope assessment  
- Internal governance engagement  
- Quiet correction over public acknowledgement  

---

## Backwards Mapping  
Teams reconstruct timelines to understand how misalignment occurred.

## Scope Containment  
They determine whether the issue is isolated or systemic.

## Record Hygiene  
Notes are clarified.
Records corrected.
Procedures aligned.

## Forward Safeguards  
Processes are tightened to prevent recurrence.

---

## 🌌 Constellations
🔁 🧠 🧹 🌀 — feedback loops, cognition, clean-up, governance repair.

---

## ✨ Stardust
post-realisation response, institutional correction, governance stabilisation
