# 🔁 Post-Realisation Phase
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*What institutions do after recognising procedural failure.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
After realisation, institutions enter a stabilisation cycle focused on risk containment, record correction, and forward protection.

This phase is quiet, procedural, and slow.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Backward reconstruction of decisions  
- Scope assessment  
- Internal governance engagement  
- Quiet correction over public acknowledgement  

---

They determine whether the issue is isolated or systemic.

### 3. **Record Hygiene**
Notes are clarified.
Records corrected.
Procedures aligned.

### 4. **Forward Safeguards**
Processes are tightened to prevent recurrence.
