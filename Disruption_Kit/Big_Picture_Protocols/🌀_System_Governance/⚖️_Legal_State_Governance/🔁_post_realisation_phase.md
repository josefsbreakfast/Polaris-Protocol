# 🔁 Post-Realisation Phase  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*What institutions do after recognising procedural failure — and before accountability.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The post-realisation phase begins **after internal recognition of error**, risk, or procedural failure — but **before** any obligation to acknowledge harm publicly, legally, or politically.

This phase is not repair.  
It is **stabilisation**.

Institutions in this phase are primarily concerned with:
- limiting exposure,
- restoring internal coherence,
- and protecting forward authority.

From the outside, it often looks like nothing is happening.  
From the inside, a great deal is.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Backward reconstruction without forward admission  
- Containment framing rather than harm framing  
- Quiet record alignment and language tightening  
- Risk modelling focused on the institution, not the affected party  
- Temporal drag as a governance tool  

---

## 🧿 Backward Mapping (Forensic, Not Moral)  
Teams reconstruct timelines to answer a narrow set of questions:

- *Where did procedure diverge from expectation?*  
- *Who touched this, formally or informally?*  
- *What records could be read unfavourably later?*

Notably absent at this stage:
- survivor impact analysis,  
- ethical reckoning,  
- proportionality review.

The goal is **coherence**, not justice.

Backward mapping is often used to:
- reclassify decisions as reasonable “at the time”,  
- disperse responsibility across process,  
- and identify documentation that needs “clarification”.

---

## 🌋 Scope Containment  
Once a narrative of “what happened” exists, institutions ask a second question:

> *Is this containable?*

Containment pathways typically include:
- isolated incident framing (“not systemic”),  
- jurisdictional narrowing (“outside our remit”),  
- temporal distancing (“legacy issue”),  
- role diffusion (“no single decision-maker”).

If scope cannot be contained internally, escalation is delayed while alignment is attempted.

---

## 🧹 Record Hygiene  
This is one of the most active — and least visible — parts of the phase.

Activities may include:
- clarifying ambiguous notes,  
- standardising language across files,  
- aligning records with current policy framing,  
- removing speculative or informal commentary,  
- retrofitting decisions to policy logic that matured later.

This is not necessarily falsification.  
It is **governance sanitisation**.

The effect, however, is the same: future readers encounter a smoother, less jagged record than the lived reality.

---

## 🕸️ Forward Safeguards (Institution-Facing)  
Once the past is stabilised, attention turns forward.

Safeguards are designed to:
- prevent recurrence *in form*,  
- preserve discretion *in substance*.

Typical outputs:
- revised guidance,  
- additional sign-off layers,  
- training updates,  
- new risk flags that trigger internal review earlier next time.

What is rarely addressed:
- survivor remediation,  
- restitution,  
- structural power imbalance.

The system protects itself first.

---

## 🐍 What This Phase Is *Not*  
It is important to name what the post-realisation phase does **not** guarantee:

- It is not accountability  
- It is not apology  
- It is not repair  
- It is not justice  

Those require **external pressure**, **time**, or **forced disclosure**.

Absent those, institutions may remain here indefinitely.

---

## ✈️ Transitioning Out of the Post-Realisation Phase  
Post-realisation is not an endpoint.  
It is a **holding pattern**.

Movement only occurs when the institution crosses from *internal coherence* to *external responsibility*. That transition is neither automatic nor comfortable.

---

## 🧮 The Next Stages (Typical Sequence)

### 1. Acknowledgement Threshold  
This is the first genuine shift.

An institution crosses it when it:
- accepts that harm occurred (not just “process deviation”),  
- recognises affected parties as legitimate stakeholders,  
- and stops treating exposure as the primary risk.

Without this threshold, nothing else follows.

---

### 2. Remedial Framing Phase  
Once harm is acknowledged, the question changes from *“How do we stabilise?”* to:

> *“What would repair require?”*

Key changes here:
- survivor impact enters the record,  
- remedy options are discussed (not just risk mitigations),  
- legal, ethical, and reputational frames diverge and must be reconciled consciously.

This phase is fragile and prone to regression.

---

### 3. Remediation & Repair  
Repair is **observable**.

It may include:
- formal apology,  
- corrective action,  
- restitution or compensation,  
- policy change with accountability hooks,  
- structural reform.

If outcomes cannot be seen, measured, or verified, repair is not occurring.

---

## 🔬 What Actually Moves an Institution Forward  
Transition is rarely driven by insight.  
It is driven by **constraint**.

Movement triggers commonly include:
- credible legal exposure,  
- regulatory scrutiny,  
- public or stakeholder visibility,  
- internal dissent with authority,  
- sustained survivor pressure.

Good intentions help.  
They are not sufficient.

---

## 🧠 Carrying the Organisation and Colleagues Through  
For people inside the system, this phase is destabilising.

Effective carry requires:
- framing acknowledgement as governance strength, not failure,  
- naming harm without scapegoating,  
- permission for internal truth before external disclosure,  
- leadership clarity about direction and expectation.

Silence breeds resistance.  
Clarity creates capacity.

---

## 🫀 Carrying Survivors Through  
This transition is often the most dangerous point for survivors.

Ethical carry requires:
- consent-based engagement at every stage,  
- bounded participation with clear expectations,  
- named timelines that are honoured,  
- refusal to make survivor composure a condition of repair.

Survivors do not exist to stabilise institutions.

---

## 🧨 Failure Modes to Watch For  
Common regression signals include:
- endless scope re-litigation,  
- reviews without teeth,  
- reframing harm as misunderstanding,  
- substituting “learning” language for accountability.

When these appear, the system is sliding back into post-realisation containment.

---

## 🥭 Transition Handoff: From Realisation to Remediation  
The post-realisation phase ends **only** when the institution formally exits stabilisation logic and enters remedial logic.

This handoff is structural, not symbolic.

It occurs when:
- responsibility replaces coherence as the organising principle,  
- survivor impact is treated as material,  
- repair becomes a defined obligation.

## 💫 Exit Criteria: Has the Post-Realisation Phase Ended?

An institution has **not** exited this phase unless **all** of the following are met.

### 1. Harm Is Named  
Explicit acknowledgement of harm; no euphemism or abstraction.

### 2. Responsibility Is Located  
Accountability attached to roles or structures, not dissolved into process.

### 3. Survivor Impact Is Material  
Entered into the record without extraction or coercion.

### 4. Repair Has Defined Outputs  
Observable, measurable, time-bound remedies.

### 5. Timelines Are Named and Kept  
Delays explained; clocks not reset.

### 6. External Accountability Exists  
Oversight and scrutiny are accepted, not resisted.

If these criteria are not met, the institution remains in post-realisation containment.  

---

## 🧭 If This Stage Has Not Been Reached  

If the exit criteria above have not been met, the institution has not yet left the post-realisation phase — regardless of how long reviews have been underway, how sincere internal language appears, or how many parallel processes are in motion.  

At this point, further cooperation, clarification, or patience is unlikely to produce movement on its own. What is required instead is a shift in leverage: from internal alignment to external constraint, from explanation to obligation.  

The matrix below is not a call to conflict, but a map of which forms of pressure reliably convert recognition into action when stabilisation has become stagnation.  

---

## 📊 Pressure & Leverage Matrix  
*Which forms of pressure actually force exit from the post-realisation phase.*  

This matrix maps **exit criteria** against **pressure types** to clarify what moves institutions out of stabilisation and into remediation.  

Goodwill is not included.  
It is not a pressure.  

---

## 🐝 Exit Criteria vs Pressure Types

| Exit Criterion | Legal Pressure | Regulatory Pressure | Reputational Pressure | Collective / Internal Pressure |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Harm is Named** | ⚠️ Moderate — risk of admission liability | ✅ Strong — naming required for compliance | ⚠️ Variable — depends on visibility | ✅ Strong — internal truth-telling forces language shift |
| **Responsibility is Located** | ✅ Strong — attribution required | ⚠️ Moderate — often structural, not personal | ⚠️ Weak — easily diffused | ✅ Strong — especially with senior dissent |
| **Survivor Impact is Material** | ⚠️ Moderate — evidentiary use | ⚠️ Moderate — equality / safeguarding duties | ⚠️ Weak — often performative | ❌ Weak — unless survivors hold organised power |
| **Repair has Defined Outputs** | ✅ Strong — remedies enforceable | ✅ Strong — corrective actions mandated | ⚠️ Moderate — symbolic repair common | ⚠️ Moderate — depends on leverage position |
| **Timelines are Named & Kept** | ✅ Strong — deadlines enforceable | ✅ Strong — review cycles bounded | ❌ Weak — delay often tolerated | ⚠️ Moderate — fatigue limits effect |
| **External Accountability Exists** | ✅ Strong — courts compel | ✅ Strong — oversight embedded | ⚠️ Moderate — scrutiny can fade | ❌ Weak — easily contained internally |

## 👀 How to Read This Matrix  

- **Legal & regulatory pressure** are the most reliable exit drivers.  
  They impose *constraints*, not requests.

- **Reputational pressure** works only when:
  - visibility is sustained, and  
  - the institution’s legitimacy depends on public trust.

- **Collective / internal pressure** is powerful when it:
  - comes from people with authority or expertise, and  
  - cannot be isolated as “personal grievance”.

Survivor testimony alone rarely forces exit — unless it is coupled with one of the above.

---

## ⚠️ Common Misapplications  

- Asking survivors to “help name harm” without leverage → **containment theatre**  
- Over-investing in reputational exposure without legal hooks → **time drag**  
- Relying on internal reviews without deadlines → **phase lock-in**

Pressure must match the exit criterion you are trying to force.

---

## 💎 Strategic Use Note  

If an institution remains stuck, ask:
> *Which exit criterion is being avoided — and what form of pressure actually compels it?*

Escalation is not aggression.  
It is alignment between leverage and obligation.
