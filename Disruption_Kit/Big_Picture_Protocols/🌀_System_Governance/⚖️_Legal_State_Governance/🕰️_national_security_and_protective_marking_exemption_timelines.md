# 🕰️ National-Security & Protective-Marking Exemption Timelines  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*Reference guide to how long security-based data-handling exemptions normally last under UK law.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
When a dataset becomes entangled with **national-security** or **protective-marking** issues, the calendar changes.  
These processes aren’t about argument but about controlled containment of sensitive information.  
The phases below show the typical rhythm when an organisation fast-tracks a case under the **Data Protection Act 2018 s.26–27** or equivalent “national-security certificate” provisions.

## 📊 Diagnostic Timeline  

| Stage | Description | Usual Time-Frame |
|:------|:-------------|:----------------|
| **Initial Containment** | The organisation identifies that a dataset may intersect with a security matter. Legal and security advisers decide whether to invoke the *national-security certificate* provisions in the DPA 2018 (s.26-27). | A few days → 2 weeks |
| **Inter-departmental Review** | The Home Office, MoD, or another competent authority checks whether protection is justified and issues a written certificate or instruction. | 2 – 6 weeks (occasionally shorter if urgent) |
| **Negotiation / Closed Mediation** | When multiple bodies are involved (e.g., a university and a government partner), classified mediation replaces open court proceedings. | 1 – 3 months (typical; can renew if unresolved) |
| **Independent Oversight / Judicial Sign-off** | The Investigatory Powers Commissioner or a closed-material judge may be asked to confirm or limit the exemption’s scope. | A few weeks |
| **Release or Continuation** | Once risk is mitigated, the certificate can be lifted and normal disclosure resumes. If the risk persists, the certificate may be renewed annually. | Variable — days if clear-cut, up to 12 months if sensitive |

## 🧭 Key Takeaway  
Even in fast-track circumstances, **3 – 6 months** is a realistic expectation for resolution.  
Cases involving defence, intelligence, or counter-terrorism data routinely sit toward the upper end of that window.
