*How accountability theatre becomes a substitute for justice.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node explains why, when prosecution becomes institutionally intolerable, systems default to **inquiries, reviews, and reports** instead.

These mechanisms are not neutral.
They serve specific governance functions.

---

## 🔄 The Substitution Pattern

When criminal prosecution stalls, institutions pivot to:
- public inquiries
- internal reviews
- independent panels
- “lessons learned” frameworks

This pattern is recurrent, not accidental.

---

## 🧯 What Inquiries Are Good At

Inquiries:
- absorb public anger
- create visible activity
- spread responsibility
- delay final judgment
- avoid adversarial standards of proof

They are stabilisation tools.

---

## ⚖️ What Inquiries Cannot Do

Inquiries cannot:
- compel self-incrimination
- impose criminal penalties
- test evidence adversarially
- establish individual guilt beyond doubt

They produce narrative, not liability.

---

## 🧠 Why Institutions Prefer Them

From a governance perspective, inquiries:
- lower legal risk
- protect senior actors
- preserve organisational continuity
- avoid precedent-setting convictions

They convert **legal crisis into managerial process**.

---

## ⚠️ The Democratic Cost

When inquiries replace prosecutions:
- victims see acknowledgment without justice
- elites face critique without consequence
- the public learns that truth ≠ accountability

Trust decays quietly.
