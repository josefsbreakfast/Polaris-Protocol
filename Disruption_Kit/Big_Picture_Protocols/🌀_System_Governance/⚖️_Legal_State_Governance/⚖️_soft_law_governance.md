# ⚖️ Soft Law Governance  
**First created:** 2025-09-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-15  
*Guidance, codes of practice, and memoranda that act as law without oversight or consent.*

## 🏛️ Concept  

Soft law refers to rules and obligations that look like law, function like law, but **are not passed through Parliament** and often **lack legal accountability**.  
They include:  
- Codes of practice  
- Ministerial directions  
- Memoranda of understanding (MoUs)  
- Regulatory guidance  
- Intelligence sharing protocols  
- Civil service or healthcare "ethics frameworks"

These soft law mechanisms shape behaviour, limit rights, and enable enforcement — all **without public debate or judicial review**.  
They are often invisible to survivors until harm is already done.

## 🔥 Why It Matters  

- **No consultation**: often issued internally or via statutory instruments.  
- **No remedy**: rarely appealable, even if they cause serious harm.  
- **Real consequences**: used to justify interventions, trigger automated responses, or silence dissent.  
- **Blurred line**: exploited to enforce behaviour as if legal, without meeting legal standards.

*⚖️ Soft Law Governance* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how unofficial rules and unpublished guidance create systems of control without democratic oversight or legal accountability.
