# 📜 From Survivor Code to Research Ethics  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*How atrocity testimony rebuilt biomedical morality.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Outlines the lineage from Nuremberg Code to modern ethics boards.  
Centres survivor resistance as the foundation of post-war medical accountability.  

---

## 🧿 From Testimony to Code  
The Nuremberg Code did not emerge from abstract ethics.  
It emerged from survivor testimony — sworn, witnessed, and undeniable.

Survivors of medical atrocities did not merely describe what was done to them.  
They described the *conditions* that made harm possible: coercion, asymmetry of power, disappearance of consent, and the use of “science” as moral camouflage.

The Code’s insistence on voluntary consent was not philosophical.  
It was corrective.

It was an attempt to convert lived harm into a structural prohibition.

---

## ⚖️ What the Codes Were Meant to Stop  
Early post-war biomedical ethics frameworks were designed to prevent:

- Research conducted on captive or dependent populations  
- Experiments justified by state interest or scientific prestige  
- Consent obtained under threat, deception, or informational imbalance  
- The disappearance of accountability once harm had occurred  

These principles were narrow by necessity.  
They targeted the most extreme abuses — because those were the ones survivors had already endured.

They were never meant to be optional.

---

## 🧾 Institutional Translation  
As biomedical research expanded, survivor-driven prohibitions were translated into institutional mechanisms:

- Ethics review boards  
- Written consent forms  
- Risk–benefit assessments  
- Professional self-regulation  

This translation was not neutral.

What began as *constraints on power* gradually became *procedures for permission*.  
Ethical review shifted from a survivor-protective function to an internal governance function.

The question quietly changed from  
“Should this be allowed?”  
to  
“Has this been approved?”

---

## 🧯 Where Ethics Became Theatre  
In many modern systems, ethical approval now functions as:

- A liability shield  
- A reputational signal  
- A compliance artefact  

Rather than a meaningful check on harm.

Consent is often:
- Fragmented across documents  
- Rendered unintelligible by technical language  
- Obtained where refusal carries implicit cost  

Survivor perspective is frequently absent at the point of approval — appearing only *after* harm, if at all.

Ethics, in these conditions, becomes procedural rather than protective.

---

## 🛰️ Modern Research Without Witness  
Contemporary research increasingly operates at scales and speeds that bypass the original assumptions of ethics governance:

- Platform experimentation  
- Behavioural and psychological trials embedded in services  
- Large-scale data extraction and secondary use  
- AI and automated decision systems trained on unwitting populations  

In these environments:
- Consent is abstracted or inferred  
- Oversight is fragmented across jurisdictions  
- Harm is diffuse, delayed, or statistically obscured  

The survivor — once the ethical anchor — is no longer visible in the system.

---

## 🧬 Survivor Sovereignty as a Missing Variable  
The original ethical codes assumed a recognisable subject:
a person who could say *no*.

Many modern research systems no longer do.

Survivor sovereignty — the right to refuse, to withdraw, to be believed, and to remain unexploited — is routinely excluded from design assumptions.

This is not an accident of progress.  
It is a governance choice.

The lesson of post-war ethics is not that review boards exist.  
It is that **atrocity produces rules — and rules decay without witness**.  

---

## 🏛️ Real-World Governance: Ethics After Translation  

The conversion of survivor-led ethical codes into institutional governance does not stop at research oversight.  
It reappears — often distorted — across multiple domains of state and quasi-state power.

What changes is not the underlying logic, but the scale, speed, and distance from witness.

---

### 📊 Data Systems & Exhaustive Harm  
In contemporary data governance, individuals are rarely treated as ethical subjects.  
They are treated as inputs.

Large-scale data collection, secondary use, and model training rely on forms of implied, bundled, or retroactive consent that no longer resemble the survivor-won protections ethics codes were designed to guarantee.

Oversight exists, but harm is:
- Distributed across populations  
- Delayed in effect  
- Difficult to attribute  
- Easy to dismiss as statistical noise  

The result is research without refusal — experimentation without encounter.

### 🛡️ Prevent, Safeguarding & Risk Governance  
In safeguarding and counter-extremism frameworks, ethical reasoning is frequently subordinated to risk management.

Rather than asking *“Who is protected?”*, systems ask:
- Who poses liability?  
- What reputational exposure exists?  
- How can uncertainty be contained?  

Survivor testimony often enters these systems only as an afterthought — or as a complication to be managed.

Here, ethical infrastructure becomes anticipatory containment:  
preventing institutional harm rather than human harm.

### 🧪 Research Complicity & Academic Systems  
Academic and state-linked research environments increasingly operate within geopolitical, military, or commercial constraints that ethics frameworks were never designed to confront.

Ethical approval, in these contexts, can function as:
- Moral laundering  
- Political insulation  
- A mechanism for narrowing legitimate inquiry  

Survivor voices — particularly those harmed by state or institutional action — are often excluded as “non-objective,” while their data, labour, or environments remain exploitable.

This is not a failure of individual ethics committees.  
It is a failure of governance design.

Across all three domains, the pattern is consistent:

Survivor-generated ethical constraints are preserved in language,  
but diluted in practice.

Governance continues — witness does not.
