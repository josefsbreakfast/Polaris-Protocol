*How atrocity testimony rebuilt biomedical morality.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Outlines the lineage from Nuremberg Code to modern ethics boards.  
Centres survivor resistance as the foundation of post-war medical accountability.  

---

## 🧿 From Testimony to Code  
The Nuremberg Code did not emerge from abstract ethics.  
It emerged from survivor testimony — sworn, witnessed, and undeniable.

Survivors of medical atrocities did not merely describe what was done to them.  
They described the *conditions* that made harm possible: coercion, asymmetry of power, disappearance of consent, and the use of “science” as moral camouflage.

The Code’s insistence on voluntary consent was not philosophical.  
It was corrective.

It was an attempt to convert lived harm into a structural prohibition.

---

## ⚖️ What the Codes Were Meant to Stop  
Early post-war biomedical ethics frameworks were designed to prevent:

- Research conducted on captive or dependent populations  
- Experiments justified by state interest or scientific prestige  
- Consent obtained under threat, deception, or informational imbalance  
- The disappearance of accountability once harm had occurred  

These principles were narrow by necessity.  
They targeted the most extreme abuses — because those were the ones survivors had already endured.

They were never meant to be optional.

---

## 🧾 Institutional Translation  
As biomedical research expanded, survivor-driven prohibitions were translated into institutional mechanisms:

- Ethics review boards  
- Written consent forms  
- Risk–benefit assessments  
- Professional self-regulation  

This translation was not neutral.

What began as *constraints on power* gradually became *procedures for permission*.  
Ethical review shifted from a survivor-protective function to an internal governance function.

The question quietly changed from  
“Should this be allowed?”  
to  
“Has this been approved?”

---

## 🧯 Where Ethics Became Theatre  
In many modern systems, ethical approval now functions as:

- A liability shield  
- A reputational signal  
- A compliance artefact  

Rather than a meaningful check on harm.

Consent is often:
- Fragmented across documents  
- Rendered unintelligible by technical language  
- Obtained where refusal carries implicit cost  

Survivor perspective is frequently absent at the point of approval — appearing only *after* harm, if at all.

Ethics, in these conditions, becomes procedural rather than protective.

---

## 🛰️ Modern Research Without Witness  
Contemporary research increasingly operates at scales and speeds that bypass the original assumptions of ethics governance:

- Platform experimentation  
- Behavioural and psychological trials embedded in services  
- Large-scale data extraction and secondary use  
- AI and automated decision systems trained on unwitting populations  

In these environments:
- Consent is abstracted or inferred  
- Oversight is fragmented across jurisdictions  
- Harm is diffuse, delayed, or statistically obscured  

The survivor — once the ethical anchor — is no longer visible in the system.

---

## 🧬 Survivor Sovereignty as a Missing Variable  
The original ethical codes assumed a recognisable subject:
a person who could say *no*.

Many modern research systems no longer do.

Survivor sovereignty — the right to refuse, to withdraw, to be believed, and to remain unexploited — is routinely excluded from design assumptions.

This is not an accident of progress.  
It is a governance choice.

The lesson of post-war ethics is not that review boards exist.  
It is that **atrocity produces rules — and rules decay without witness**.

## 🏮 Footer  
*📜 From Survivor Code to Research Ethics* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the conversion of trauma into guardrails.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
