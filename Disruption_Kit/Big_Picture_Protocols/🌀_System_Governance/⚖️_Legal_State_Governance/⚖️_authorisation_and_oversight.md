*Ministerial and judicial checks on intelligence powers.*

## ✨ Summary

Every intrusion comes signed, minister and judge. That’s the promise. But survivors know signatures don’t always equal consent.  

---

## 🧬 The Double-Lock System  
- **Ministerial approval**: Secretary of State must sign, certifying necessity and proportionality.  
- **Judicial approval**: Judicial Commissioner must independently review and confirm.  
- **Legal anchor**: IPA 2016, s.19(4) — warrant must fall “within the functions” of the relevant agency.  

## 🕸️ Functions & Boundaries  
- MI5 warrants: Home Secretary.  
- MI6 & GCHQ warrants: Foreign Secretary.  
- Judicial Commissioners: senior judges, independent of government.  

## 🦇 Oversight Bodies  
- **IPCO** (Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office): inspects warrants, compliance, data handling.  
- **ISC** (Intelligence and Security Committee): parliamentary scrutiny.  
- **IPT** (Investigatory Powers Tribunal): hears public complaints.

Rubber-stamp or safeguard? Survivors live in the gap between theory and practice. Every warrant is supposed to be a lock. Sometimes it feels like a turnstile.

*Authorisation and Oversight* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It explains how intelligence warrants are issued and checked in the UK — and how gaps between process and experience undermine survivor trust.
