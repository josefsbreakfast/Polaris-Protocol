# ⚖️ Where Prosecutorial Discretion Lives  
**First created:** 2025-12-20 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*The precise locations where judgment, risk, and power shape charging decisions.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node isolates **where discretion actually exists** inside the English and Welsh prosecution system — not rhetorically, but operationally.

It explains how a formally independent system can repeatedly make similar decisions **without explicit coordination**.

---

## 🧠 Discretion Is Not One Moment

Prosecutorial discretion is **distributed**, not concentrated.

It appears across multiple stages:
- evidence framing
- charging thresholds
- case selection
- resource allocation
- review escalation
- abandonment decisions

By the time a case is formally declined, discretion has already been exercised several times.

---

## ⚖️ Stage One: Evidence Framing

Before any public-interest test:
- evidence is assessed for admissibility
- witness credibility is pre-judged
- narrative coherence is evaluated

Elite cases are more likely to be framed as:
- “complex”
- “fragile”
- “unsafe”
- “hard to explain to a jury”

This framing quietly narrows what follows.

---

## 🧮 Stage Two: Threshold Calibration

The legal test is “realistic prospect of conviction”.

In practice, the **confidence threshold floats**:
- higher for powerful defendants
- lower for marginalised suspects

This is not written policy.
It is learned behaviour under asymmetric risk.

---

## 🧩 Stage Three: Internal Review Dynamics

Cases with perceived sensitivity are:
- escalated more often
- reviewed more times
- exposed to more risk-averse actors

Each additional review:
- increases delay
- increases doubt
- increases chances of attrition

Discretion multiplies through process, not decision.

---

## 🏛️ Stage Four: Resource Triage

The CPS must constantly choose:
- which cases get senior staff
- which get specialist counsel
- which are quietly deprioritised

Elite cases consume:
- more time
- more money
- more institutional attention

They therefore face greater pressure to justify their own existence.

---

## ⚠️ The Key Insight

Discretion does not live in a single “yes or no”.

It lives in **cumulative caution**.

By the time a non-prosecution decision is announced, the outcome is often already inevitable.
