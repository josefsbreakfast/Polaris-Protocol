# ⚖️ Official Secrets Reform and Accountability  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-13  
*Re-examining secrecy architecture, 'perpetual hook', and controlled accountability.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The Official Secrets Act was designed for a 1940s world of filing cabinets.  
Today it governs a cloud of commercial NDAs and digital infrastructures.  
Reform is not about loosening secrecy; it’s about clarifying ownership.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Perpetual Hook Problem:** lifetime liability without sunset clauses.
- **Commercial vs Security Secrecy:** blurred lines between state and contractor.
- **Structural Drift:** accountability spreads sideways instead of upward.
- **Ethical Reform:** sunset clauses, cross-service audits, classified ombudsman.

---

## 🧿 Analysis  
Updating the OSA would modernise—not weaken—security. Clear categories of secrecy and recall reduce both personal anxiety and institutional paralysis. Containment without clarity becomes corrosion.
