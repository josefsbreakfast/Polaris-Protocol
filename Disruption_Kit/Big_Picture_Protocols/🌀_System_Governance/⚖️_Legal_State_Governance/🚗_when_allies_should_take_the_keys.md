*Why allyship increases duty to intervene — and how non-intervention entrenches harm.*

## 🧭 What this node is
This node sets out the principle that **allyship heightens responsibility** when serious harm becomes foreseeable.

It addresses:
- why “supporting an ally” does not excuse inaction,
- how continued assistance can entrap partner forces,
- and when boundary-setting becomes a legal and moral requirement.

This is not a claim about intent.  
It is a claim about **duty under influence**.

---

## 🚗 The analogy (plain language)
If your friend is drunk and reaching for the car keys:

- they chose to drink,
- they would be the one to drive,
- but if you knowingly let it happen, you are not neutral.

The closer the relationship, the **greater** the responsibility to intervene.

States work the same way.

---

## ⚖️ Ally duty under international law
Under prevention and aiding-and-assisting doctrines:

- duty increases with **knowledge**,
- duty increases with **capacity**,
- duty increases with **leverage**.

Allies have:
- privileged access,
- influence over tempo and scope,
- and credibility with decision-makers.

That makes ally inaction **more**, not less, legally relevant.

---

## 🔑 What “taking the keys” actually means
Taking the keys does **not** require:

- ending all relations,
- public humiliation,
- or permanent rupture.

It means:
- setting explicit boundaries,
- conditioning assistance,
- pausing enabling support,
- and making consequences legible.

Boundary-setting is an act of restraint, not hostility.

---

## 🧠 Why allies avoid taking the keys
Allies hesitate because:

- confrontation risks relationship damage,
- precedent threatens other theatres,
- escalation looks politically costly,
- and “managing risk” feels safer than stopping it.

These incentives favour **delay**, even as harm escalates.

---

## 🧩 How non-intervention entrenches harm
When allies continue support without boundaries:

1. Partner forces interpret continuity as validation.
2. Internal dissent space shrinks.
3. Escalation becomes normalised.
4. Exit ramps narrow for individuals.
5. Legal exposure deepens for everyone involved.

What begins as loyalty becomes **entrapment**.

---

## 🧯 Who gets hurt by not taking the keys
Failure to intervene harms:

- civilians subjected to escalating violence,
- partner force personnel exposed to unlawful acts,
- allied civil servants and analysts carrying moral injury,
- and the credibility of legal norms meant to prevent atrocity.

No one emerges protected.

---

## 🚫 Why “neutral monitoring” is not an option
Once risk is clear and leverage exists:

- watching is a choice,
- silence is permission,
- and process without interruption is participation.

Neutrality collapses under foreseeability.

---

## 🧷 Working claim
Allyship is not a shield against responsibility.

When harm is foreseeable and leverage exists, **taking the keys is the minimum act of care** — for civilians, for partner forces, and for the ally itself.

Failure to do so converts support into complicity.

*When allies should take the keys* is a core synthesis node in the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to clarify that restraint is not abandonment, and that timely boundary-setting is often the only way to prevent deeper harm — including harm to the ally being “supported.”
