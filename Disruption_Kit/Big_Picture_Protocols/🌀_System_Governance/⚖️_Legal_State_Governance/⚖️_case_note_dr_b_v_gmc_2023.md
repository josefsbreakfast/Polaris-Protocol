## 🧭 Citation  

**[2023] EWHC B10 (KB)** — King’s Bench Division (Misuse of Data)  
**Judge:** HHJ Belcher (sitting as High Court Judge)  

---

## 🧠 Facts  

- “Dr B,” a medical practitioner, discovered that the General Medical Council (GMC) had used and circulated his private and special-category data without lawful basis.  
- Disclosures went beyond the legitimate scope of fitness-to-practise functions and were shared externally without consent.  
- After objecting, Dr B experienced institutional harassment, reputational damage, and psychological distress.  

The claim challenged the GMC’s assumption that internal investigative functions implied blanket immunity from data-protection liability.

## ⚖️ Issues & Findings  

| Legal Question | Court Finding | Principle Affirmed |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Was there a lawful basis under GDPR Art 6 & 9 for processing? | ❌ No — processing exceeded necessity and lacked lawfulness. | Public bodies remain fully subject to GDPR constraints. |
| Was there misuse of private information? | ✅ Yes — information was private and disclosure unjustified. | Confidentiality breach can co-exist with data-protection breach. |
| Are damages for distress recoverable without financial loss? | ✅ Yes — re-affirmed *Vidal-Hall v Google (2015)* and Art 82 GDPR. | Distress-only damage is a recognized remedy. |

**Outcome:** £5 000 general damages for distress and anxiety; costs awarded to claimant.

## 🧩 Principles Derived  

1️⃣ **Foreseeable distress is compensable** even without economic loss.  
2️⃣ **Regulators and public bodies remain GDPR-bound** and cannot invoke blanket functional immunity.  
3️⃣ **Procedural opacity ≠ lawfulness** — internal process does not negate rights.  
4️⃣ **Proportionality is determinative** — data use must be the least-intrusive means of achieving a legitimate aim.  
5️⃣ **Data-subject remedies extend to erasure and rectification** of unlawfully held records.  

Together these principles re-anchor the tort of misuse of private information alongside GDPR Art 82 liability.

## 🧭 Relevance to Voice-Suppression Harms  

- Establishes judicial recognition of **psychological harm arising from institutional data misuse**.  
- Confirms that distress-only damages can compensate for **suppression of expressive voice** and **reputational erasure**.  
- Supports the inclusion of **voice-suppression restitution clauses** in future Crown-use and defence data contracts.  
- Demonstrates that **data misuse is a form of speech harm**, linking privacy to freedom of expression jurisprudence.  

This case bridges data law and psychological accountability within the Polaris “Voice Suppression” cluster.

## 📚 Comparative Authority  

| Case | Principle Reinforced |
|:--|:--|
| *Vidal-Hall v Google Inc (2015) EWCA Civ 311* | Intangible distress damage is recoverable under Data Protection Act 1998. |
| *Lloyd v Google LLC (2021) UKSC 50* | Collective claims require proof of individual damage — Dr B shows individual route remains open. |
| *Gulati v MGN Ltd (2015) EWCA Civ 1291* | Vindicatory damages for loss of control over information. |
| *Warren v DSC Ltd (2018)* | Public bodies liable for data misuse in disciplinary context. |

Dr B extends this line by placing psychological impact front and centre.

## 🧩 Analytical Notes  

- **Voice as data** — where speech, record, and identity are intertwined, control over data is control over voice.  
- **Regulatory harassment** — misuse of data in disciplinary settings can create self-reinforcing containment loops.  
- **Survivor jurisprudence** — this case functions as a template for claimants pursuing emotional and expressive damages under data law.  
- **Institutional ethics** — professional bodies must integrate trauma-informed data governance standards to prevent secondary harms.
