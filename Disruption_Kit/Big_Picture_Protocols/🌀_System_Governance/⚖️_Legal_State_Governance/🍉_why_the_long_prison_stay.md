# 🍉 Why The Long Prison Stay?  
**First created:** 2025-12-19 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*How prolonged remand happens, why it is exceptional, and what it costs the taxpayer.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines the **prolonged use of remand in custody** in politically sensitive cases, with a focus on why detention extends for months or years **before trial**, and how this compares — financially and legally — with release on bail.

It is not an allegation of wrongdoing.  
It is an analysis of **process, incentives, and cost**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Bail as the legal default in England and Wales  
- Why terrorism-related cases alter — but do not remove — this presumption  
- How delay becomes structurally normalised  
- Direct comparison of **taxpayer costs**: bail vs detention  
- Why prolonged remand creates fiscal, legal, and ethical risk  

---

## ⚖️ Bail Is The Legal Baseline  
Under the **Bail Act 1976**, the default position is release on bail unless the prosecution can demonstrate substantial grounds for detention.

In protest-related and political cases, courts routinely use:
- strict bail conditions,
- protest bans,
- non-association orders,
- curfews,
- reporting requirements,
- electronic monitoring.

Custody is meant to be **exceptional**, not routine.

---

## 🧱 Why Remand Becomes Prolonged  
In cases charged under **counter-terrorism legislation**, several factors combine to extend remand:

- complex evidence and disclosure processes  
- digital forensics backlogs  
- risk-averse prosecutorial strategy  
- repeated extensions of custody time limits  
- institutional reluctance to be seen as “taking risk”  

Each extension may be lawful in isolation.  
Together, they can produce **de facto punishment before trial**.

---

## ⏳ How Unusual Is Long-Term Remand?  
While short remand periods are common in serious cases, **remand extending toward or beyond 18–24 months** is:

- legally sensitive,  
- increasingly difficult to justify, and  
- closely scrutinised under Article 5 ECHR (right to liberty).

At this point, the burden on the state is high.

---

## 💰 What Detention Costs The Taxpayer  
Detention is expensive — especially under enhanced security.

Indicative figures (rounded, conservative estimates):

- **Standard prison place:** ~£50,000 per person per year  
- **High-security / specialist regimes:** £60,000–£80,000+ per year  
- **Additional costs:**  
  - prison healthcare  
  - mental health services  
  - hunger strike monitoring  
  - legal oversight and reviews  

A prolonged remand of two years can easily exceed **£120,000–£160,000 per person**, before trial.

---

## 🏷️ What Bail Costs The Taxpayer  
By contrast, bail with conditions typically involves:

- probation or police supervision  
- electronic monitoring (where used)  
- reporting requirements  

Indicative annual costs:

- **Standard bail supervision:** low thousands per year  
- **Electronic tagging:** ~£3,000–£5,000 per year  

Even at the upper end, bail costs are **a fraction of custodial detention**.

---

## 📊 Cost Comparison (Indicative)

| Measure | Bail With Conditions | Prolonged Remand |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Annual cost per person | £3k–£5k | £50k–£80k+ |
| Healthcare burden | Minimal | High |
| Legal risk | Low | Increasing over time |
| Human impact | Contained | Severe |
| Trial integrity | Preserved | At risk |
| Public confidence | Higher | Fragile |

From a fiscal perspective alone, prolonged remand is **hard to justify**.

---

## 🧠 Incentives And Risk Aversion  
Why, then, does detention persist?

Because:
- **institutional risk aversion** favours containment over discretion,  
- no single actor bears the full cost of delay,  
- and political sensitivity discourages early release.

The taxpayer absorbs the cost.  
The detainee absorbs the harm.

---

## 🚨 Why Hunger Strikes Emerge Here  
Hunger strikes often arise when:
- bail applications fail repeatedly,  
- timelines stretch indefinitely,  
- and remand begins to feel like a sentence.

They are not a shortcut.  
They are a **signal of procedural exhaustion**.

---

## 🧩 What This Reveals  
Prolonged remand is not:
- cheaper,
- safer,
- or more efficient.

It is:
- fiscally costly,  
- legally fragile,  
- and ethically corrosive.

When bail could achieve the same risk management at a fraction of the cost, extended detention becomes a **governance choice**, not a necessity.

---

## 🗣️ Narrative Distortion, Security Failure, And Collective Punishment

A recurring pattern in press and political discourse has been the treatment of a **single extreme incident** — the unauthorised entry onto an RAF base and the spraying of paint into an aircraft engine — as if it were **representative of all Palestine Action cases**.

This is factually misleading.

In reality, the majority of cases involving Palestine Action relate to:
- damage to **private property**,
- symbolic or disruptive acts at **arms factories or corporate premises**,
- actions such as removing roof tiles, occupying buildings, or blocking access.

These actions are **not equivalent**, legally or practically, to breaching a military installation.

---

## 🐍 Worst-Case Generalisation As Narrative Strategy

The RAF base incident has been repeatedly foregrounded to:
- elevate perceived threat levels across the entire group,
- justify terrorism framing and proscription,
- normalise prolonged remand and denial of bail,
- and flatten hundreds of distinct cases into a single extreme archetype.

This is a classic **worst-case generalisation** tactic:
one exceptional event is used to define all related activity.

Historically, this approach has been used against:
- suffragettes,
- trade unionists,
- Irish activists,
- and environmental movements.

The effect is always the same:  
**erase scale, erase diversity, erase proportionality**.

---

## ✈️ The Missing Question: Security Failure

If activists were able to:
- access a RAF base,
- enter restricted areas,
- and interfere with military equipment,

then this represents a **serious security failure**.

In any other national security context, the primary public questions would be:
- How was access gained?
- Why was the perimeter not secure?
- Why was detection delayed or absent?
- What remedial action has been taken?
- Has the vulnerability been fixed?

Instead, public discourse has focused almost exclusively on:
- punishment,
- sentencing,
- proscription,
- and extended detention.

The absence of parallel discussion about **security remediation** is striking.

---

## 🔥 Punishment As Embarrassment Management

Even for those who support proscription, it is notable that:
- no sustained public reassurance has been offered that the security failure has been addressed,
- no transparent account has been given of how the breach occurred,
- and accountability has been displaced entirely onto protesters.

This suggests that punishment is being used to:
- redirect attention away from institutional failure,
- reassert control symbolically,
- and close down scrutiny.

Punishment manages embarrassment more effectively than it improves security.

---

## 🧨 Why This Matters For Remand And Hunger Strikes

This narrative compression directly feeds into:
- elevated threat perception,
- prolonged remand,
- denial of bail,
- and public tolerance for extreme measures.

If the public is encouraged to believe that:
“All cases are equivalent to the RAF base incident,”

then:
- exceptional detention appears justified,
- nuance disappears,
- and hunger strikes can be dismissed as the irrational actions of “extremists”.

This framing does not reflect the factual diversity of cases.
It serves administrative and political convenience.

---

## 🪼 The Legitimate Public Interest Question

A democratic and security-literate response would ask:

If a military base was breached,  
**why are we not publicly accounting for how that failure occurred and how it has been fixed?**

That question is:
- non-ideological,
- fiscally responsible,
- and squarely in the public interest.

Its absence should concern anyone serious about security, proportionality, and governance.

---

## 🏥 Austerity And NHS Underfunding: Opportunity Cost

This level of expenditure sits uncomfortably alongside persistent claims of **public-sector scarcity**, including:
- NHS funding shortfalls,
- long waiting lists,
- delayed access to mental health services,
- and underfunded community care.

Using the most conservative estimate:
- **£400,000 per year** for eight people on remand,
- **£800,000** if remand extends to two years,

this spending represents **real opportunity cost**, not abstract accounting.

For example, comparable sums could fund:
- multiple full-time nurses or paramedics for a year,
- community mental health practitioners,
- early-intervention services that reduce A&E admissions,
- or backlog-reduction capacity within the Crown Court system itself.

Instead, public money is being absorbed by:
- prolonged pre-trial detention,
- enhanced security regimes,
- prison healthcare escalation,
- and repeated legal reviews —

all without accelerating trial timelines or improving public safety.

---

## 🔄 Scarcity Is A Political Choice, Not A Natural Law

The repeated claim that “there is no money” for:
- healthcare,
- courts,
- social care,
- or community services,

sits uneasily beside the willingness to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on **extended remand for unconvicted individuals**.

This is not fiscal restraint.
It is **selective allocation**.

Scarcity is being imposed downstream, while upstream inefficiency is tolerated.

---

## 🧾 What The Taxpayer Actually Gets

From the taxpayer’s perspective, this expenditure delivers:
- no faster justice,
- no reduction in court backlogs,
- no resolution of the underlying case,
- and increasing legal and humanitarian risk.

The public pays more — and gets less.

That contradiction is especially stark during a cost-of-living crisis, where the same public is being told that:
- NHS care must be rationed,
- public-sector pay must be restrained,
- and delays are unavoidable.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

When the state chooses expensive containment over cheaper, lawful alternatives such as bail with conditions, it sends a clear signal:

> money is available for punishment and delay,  
> but not for care, speed, or repair.

That signal does not remain confined to prisons.
It shapes public trust across the entire system.
