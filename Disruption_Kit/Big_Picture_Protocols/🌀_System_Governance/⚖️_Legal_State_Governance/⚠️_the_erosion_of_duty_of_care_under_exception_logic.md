# ⚠️ The Erosion of Duty of Care Under Exception Logic  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*How exceptional frameworks degrade the state’s custodial obligations — and why this threatens democratic stability.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The duty of care owed by the state to individuals in custody is absolute.  
It is not contingent on charge, conviction, classification, or public opinion.  

Duty of care is the constitutional counterweight to state coercive power.  

Exception logic — frameworks that rely on risk rather than evidence — places pressure on this obligation.  
When applied to unconvicted detainees, particularly those whose bodies are deteriorating, the duty of care becomes vulnerable to erosion.  

The hunger strikes associated with Palestine Action demonstrate how quickly this erosion can occur.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Explains why duty of care is foundational in liberal democracy.  
- Maps how exceptional detention weakens custodial obligations.  
- Uses hunger strikes to illustrate constitutional stress.  
- Connects custodial neglect to broader democratic legitimacy risks.  

---

## 🦁 Duty of Care as a Constitutional Obligation  
In English law, ECHR jurisprudence, and UN standards, the state must:

- protect life,  
- prevent degrading treatment,  
- provide adequate medical care,  
- ensure humane conditions,  
- and prevent avoidable deterioration.

These obligations apply *most strongly* in pretrial detention, where innocence is operative.

Duty of care is what prevents coercive power from becoming arbitrary power.

## 🌩️ How Exceptional Logic Erodes Duty of Care  
Exceptional logic reframes detainees as:

- risks to be managed,  
- security liabilities,  
- entities whose welfare is secondary to control,  
- individuals whose suffering is interpreted through suspicion.

This shift subtly reorders priorities:

> *Safety becomes conditional.  
> Care becomes discretionary.  
> Deterioration becomes administratively tolerable.*

This is the beginning of erosion.

---

## 🍉 Case Example: Palestine Action Hunger Strikes  
In this scenario:

- detainees are legally innocent,  
- several are young,  
- none are accused of harm-to-persons offences,  
- and some have been hospitalised with starvation-related complications.

Yet the state’s response appears governed more by security framing than by duty of care obligations.

This is a constitutional tension:  
exception logic is overriding custodial duty.

---

## 🌋 Why Hunger Strikes Stress the Duty of Care Framework  
Hunger strikes create a clash:

- The body deteriorates.  
- The state must act.  
- But action risks appearing coercive.  
- And inaction risks violating duty of care.

Exceptional logic frequently pushes institutions toward *inaction*, reframed as neutrality or non-interference.

But for a detainee under state control, deterioration is not a private act.  
It is a condition occurring inside state power.

This is where erosion becomes visible.

---

## 🏛️ The Democratic Risk  
If the state demonstrates tolerance for the decline of legally innocent bodies, the public infers:

- selective care,  
- politicised protection,  
- erosion of universality in rights,  
- and normalisation of avoidable harm.

This weakens trust in:

- the justice system,  
- custodial institutions,  
- constitutional safeguards,  
- and international obligations.

Duty of care is a cornerstone of legitimacy.  
When it erodes, the democratic structure destabilises.

---

## 🐉 The ECHR Vector  
Persistent erosion creates pressure against:

- Article 2 (right to life)  
- Article 3 (prohibition of degrading treatment)  
- Article 5 (right to liberty and security)

If exceptionalism continues, compliance appears increasingly costly, framing ECHR withdrawal as an “administrative solution.”

This is a constitutional hazard, not a political inevitability.
