# ⚖️ Judicial reviews, parliamentary committees, and procedural delay

*How law, scrutiny, and process were used to manage risk without interrupting continuity.*

## 🧭 What this node is
This node maps how **judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny, and internal legal process** functioned during the Gaza war period as **containment mechanisms rather than brakes**.

It does not argue that courts or committees acted in bad faith.  
It shows how **procedure substituted for prevention** once risk became visible.

---

## ⚖️ Judicial review (what it can and cannot do)
Judicial review in the UK:

- examines **process**, not outcomes,
- defers to the executive on national security,
- assesses rationality, not morality,
- and operates on a **slow timeline**.

In arms-export and foreign-policy cases, courts typically ask:
- Was a decision taken lawfully?
- Was relevant information considered?
- Was the process irrational or procedurally defective?

They do **not**:
- order foreign-policy outcomes,
- suspend cooperation automatically,
- or impose preventative duties proactively.

This makes JR a **rear-view mirror**, not an emergency brake.

## 🧩 Arms export judicial reviews (pattern)
During early 2024:

- Challenges focused on whether the government had **properly assessed risk**, not whether it should halt support outright.
- The government repeatedly argued that:
  - assessments were ongoing,
  - reviews were active,
  - and discretion remained with ministers.
- Courts treated continued review as evidence of procedural compliance.

The effect:
- continuity was legally insulated,
- while prevention was deferred.

---

## 🏛️ Parliamentary committees (structural limits)
Select committees and subcommittees:

- can question,
- can request documents,
- can express concern,
- but **cannot compel policy change**.

Key constraints:
- classified material limits transparency,
- ministers control disclosure,
- questioning occurs after decisions are made,
- and findings are advisory.

Committees therefore generate **record**, not interruption.

---

## ⏳ Procedural delay as risk management
Across courts and Parliament, a consistent pattern emerges:

1. Risk becomes visible.
2. Review is initiated.
3. Review is cited as justification for continuity.
4. Time passes.
5. Facts on the ground change irreversibly.
6. Later adjustments are framed as responsiveness.

This is not accidental delay.  
It is **structural latency**.

---

## 🧠 Why process crowds out prevention
Prevention requires:
- early friction,
- fast pauses,
- asymmetric caution.

Procedure delivers:
- proportionality,
- balance,
- and defensibility **after the fact**.

When a system defaults to:
- review over suspension,
- assessment over interruption,
- confidentiality over disclosure,

it becomes optimised for **managing exposure**, not stopping harm.

---

## 🧯 Downstream effects
- Legal compliance becomes performative rather than protective.
- Courts are asked to legitimate decisions they cannot meaningfully alter.
- Committees absorb political pressure without changing outcomes.
- Downstream actors are told “the courts are looking at it” while work continues.
- Prevention obligations are hollowed out by tempo.

---

## 🧷 Working claim
Judicial review and parliamentary scrutiny did not fail individually.

They failed **systemically** because:
- neither is designed to interrupt executive continuity quickly,
- both defer to ministerial judgement,
- and both treat process as evidence of responsibility.

In genocide prevention contexts, that design is inadequate.

## 🏮 Footer

*Judicial reviews, parliamentary committees, and procedural delay* is a supporting node in the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to explain how **lawful process can coexist with preventable harm**, and why accountability mechanisms that look robust on paper may fail under conditions requiring early interruption.
