*Cross-border governance tricks where obligations are displaced onto allies to evade accountability.*

## ✨ Concept  
International laundering occurs when a domestic institution uses **alliances, partnerships, or shared jurisdiction** to displace responsibility.  
It looks like diplomacy. It operates like misdirection.

Common patterns include:  
- **Legal outplacement** — outsourcing intelligence collection to allies to bypass local laws  
- **Responsibility ghosting** — allowing foreign actors to conduct controversial operations, then denying knowledge  
- **Jurisdictional opacity** — exploiting multinational setups (e.g. NATO, Five Eyes) to create **no-clear-owner** scenarios for harm  

This is not just statecraft. It is **containment engineering at scale**.
