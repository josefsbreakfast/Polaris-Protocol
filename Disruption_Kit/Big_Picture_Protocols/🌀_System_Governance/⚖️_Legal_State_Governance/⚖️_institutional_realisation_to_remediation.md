# ⚖️ Institutional Realisation to Remediation  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*How institutions move from recognising failure to managing, limiting, or repairing harm.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node maps the transition from **internal recognition of failure** to **external-facing remediation behaviour**.

It focuses on what happens *after* an institution realises that harm has occurred — not in public statements, but internally:
when legal teams are looped in, risk registers updated, and response pathways quietly narrowed.

Crucially, institutional remediation is rarely designed around justice or repair.
It is designed around **uncertainty reduction**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Separation of harm from fault  
- Legal and governance oversight escalation  
- Preference for quiet, bounded resolution  
- Emphasis on closure over contest or truth  
- Risk-managed acknowledgement without liability  

---

## 🧿 Stage 1: Harm Recognition (Internal)  
At this stage, institutions acknowledge **impact** without conceding **responsibility**.

Common signals include:
- internal emails noting “regrettable outcomes”  
- references to “unintended effects”  
- framing harm as procedural rather than systemic  

The key move is *translation*:
human harm is converted into organisational risk language.

Nothing is public yet.
But the institution now knows it has a problem.

---

## 📜 Stage 2: Legal Posture Shift  
Once harm is recognised, legal posture quietly changes.

Typical indicators:
- communications are rerouted through legal or governance teams  
- language becomes conditional, abstract, and non-specific  
- informal conversations cease; everything becomes recordable  

This is not escalation in service of truth.
It is escalation in service of **containment**.

From this point onward, every action is evaluated for:
- precedent risk  
- liability exposure  
- discoverability  
- reputational bleed  

---

## 🪼 Stage 3: Resolution Pathway Selection  
Institutions rarely ask *what repair requires*.
They ask *what resolution they can survive*.

Preferred pathways tend to include:
- carefully worded apology without admission  
- correction without attribution of fault  
- compensation framed as goodwill  
- policy revision detached from the original harm  

What matters is not adequacy — but **finality**.

A “successful” resolution is one that:
- closes the issue  
- prevents escalation  
- limits future obligation  

---

## 💫 Stage 4: Containment Priority  
At this stage, the goal is to **close the loop cleanly**.

This may involve:
- confidentiality clauses  
- procedural exhaustion  
- time delays that encourage fatigue  
- reframing the matter as resolved regardless of lived impact  

The institution considers the matter finished
even if harm persists.

Containment is treated as closure.
Silence is treated as consent.

---

## 🧭 Failure Mode: Repair vs Resolution  
True remediation requires:
- acknowledgement of responsibility  
- proportional repair  
- structural change  
- survivor-defined adequacy  

Institutional resolution requires only:
- reduced exposure  
- reputational stability  
- internal sign-off  

These are not the same process.
They often point in opposite directions.

*⚖️ Institutional Realisation to Remediation* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how institutions move from recognising harm to selecting remediation strategies — and how those strategies often prioritise containment over repair.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
