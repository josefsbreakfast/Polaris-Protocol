*How institutions move from recognising failure to repairing harm.*

## 🛰️ Orientation
This node maps the transition from internal recognition of error to external-facing remediation.

Institutions prefer resolution pathways that minimise uncertainty, liability, and reputational damage.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Separation of harm from fault  
- Legal and governance oversight  
- Preference for quiet settlement  
- Emphasis on closure over contest  

---

## 🧿 Harm Recognition  
Institutions acknowledge impact without admitting blame.

## 📜 Legal Posture Shift  
Language becomes careful.
Communications formalise.

## 🪼 Resolution Pathway  
Options include:
- apology  
- correction  
- compensation  
- policy revision  

## 💫 Containment Priority  
The goal is to close the loop cleanly.
