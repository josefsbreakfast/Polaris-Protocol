**Please note:** This note is currently being expanded with case examples during Iron Swords. These are graphic. Final version is not yet complete.  

I am using "martyr" as a stand-in for the Arabic phrase. I use z"L after all names of deceased persons, as this is how we would traditionally honour their memory after life. I commonly use a longer version to balance cultural norms, but these are building-notes for final version.

## 🍉 Key Moments - Context  
- Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, 2023-11-17. Initially claimed as both "crossfire" and "non-intentional" by IDF; pattern of explanations adjusted to narrative and reception will persist throughout Iron Swords.  
- IMAJ Oct 2023 ed. openly defied Geneva Conventions and standard medical oaths (I promise you, Maimonides would not be into it)
- **All diaspora medical professionals and students are subject to algorithmic exposure from Oct 07 2023 onwards.** This is never accounted for fully under PSED in medical schools or in the NHS. UK Government instructs Civil Service to fly IL flag within Oct 2023, without Palestinian flag; mortality is already disproportioned by end Oct 2023, mostly civilian martyrs.    
- ICJ issues precautionary measures to protect the Palestinian people from genocide in Jan 2024; all territories, all states, all organisations, all individuals liable.  
- Sieges of hospitals follow Al-Ahli Arab Hospital; Al-Shifa first two sieges in Apr 2024 are especially escalatory. Significant evidence of systematic war crimes to digital observers. Imperial core medical associations hesitate, known lawfare pressure towards individuals, unknown to wider associations. As reference, whilst not directly alike, action was taken in late apartheid by other countries' MAs to protest SA inclusion in WMA.  
- Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh (z"L) - beloved and senior member of medical community in Gaza, hospital director and long-standing orthopaedic surgeon. Eyewitness testimony suggests Dr. Adnan was tortured, and that it was believed he died as a result of rape perforating the large bowel, with death from resulting haemorrhage on background of poor nutrition in detention and maltreatment. This is an extremely painful manner of death. Shortly after Dr. Adnan's premature death at 49 (Apr 2024), Israeli whistleblowers came forward to report on Sde Teiman conditions and serious torture concerns (May 2024). Shortly after in Aug 2024, "Welcome To Hell" released by B'Tselem. Conditions of arrests would be replicated in later arrests of physicians in view of international digital observeration. The manner of torture and the degree of violence of rape of Palestinian people imprisoned is now subject to leaked footage from Sde Teiman, with a number of survivors having spoken about their experience to the press and to the UN, serving as witnesses as well as victims to these war crimes.  
- Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya (multiple, sustained calls for international support, deranked from algorithms, IL-UK meeting not openly declared, AI responses to FCDO emails, son martyred, second arrest has led to sustained detention without known cause, due process, and with torture, medical concerns, and death of mother during detention)

## 🛰️ Risks  
- Thin public provenance makes false claims plausible.  
- High-stakes complaints accepted before forensic checks.  
- Chilling effect: professionals withdraw from public discourse.  

---

## 🩺 Recommendations  
- Unions issue member protection guidance.  
- Investigations require technical provenance before sanction.  
- Vendor contracts mandate preservation.  
- Provide support and rapid redress.  
- Train investigators on C3O (containment, coercion, clone, override).
