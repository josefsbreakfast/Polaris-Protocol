**Please note:** This note is currently being expanded with case examples during Iron Swords. These are graphic. Final version is not yet complete.  

I am using "martyr" as a stand-in for the Arabic phrase. I use z"L after all names of deceased persons, as this is how we would traditionally honour their memory after life. I commonly use a longer version to balance cultural norms, but these are building-notes for final version.

## 🍉 Key Moments - Context  
- Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, 2023-11-17. Initially claimed as both "crossfire" ("it was kkhamas") and "non-intentional" ("we didn't mean to, honest") by IDF; pattern of explanations adjusted to narrative and reception will persist throughout Iron Swords.
- Prior NATO background: even one-off strikes merit media reporting and investigation. Ix quality arguably variable and political; not typically of debate, frequent, or outright justified. This changes over Iron Swords and Russia mirrors in Ukraine.    
- IMAJ Oct 2023 ed. openly defied Geneva Conventions and standard medical oaths (I promise you, Maimonides would not be into it). Jewish doctors and medical students, inc diaspora (eg me), instructed to offensively defend IL in narrative and digital warfare spaces.  
- **All diaspora medical professionals and students are subject to algorithmic exposure from Oct 07 2023 onwards.** This is never accounted for fully under PSED, TIP/TIP requirements, EA 2010, or ECHR, in either medical schools or in the wider NHS. Instead, UK healthcare professionals and trainees are expected to maintain ordinary performance whilst subject to "wartime" narratives and suppression. As political comparison, UK Government instructs Civil Service to fly IL flag within Oct 2023, without Palestinian flag; mortality is already disproportioned by end Oct 2023, mostly civilian martyrs. Doctors are watching other doctors be murdered, streamed to their phones based on mathematical modelling of proxies for their identity, supportee by their own governments and colleagues, in flagrant violation of IHL and international norms; the same doctors exposed to this in diaspora are expected to have no objections or emotions to this textbook example of vicarious trauma. Lawfare ongoing without institutional protections during this time to the present day. UK Government maintains hypernormalised posture of extremely implausible "plausible deniability".  
- ICJ issues precautionary measures to protect the Palestinian people from genocide in Jan 2024; all territories, all states, all organisations, all individuals liable.  
- Sieges of hospitals follow Al-Ahli Arab Hospital; Al-Shifa first two sieges in Apr 2024 are especially escalatory. Significant evidence of systematic war crimes to digital observers. Imperial core medical associations hesitate, known lawfare pressure towards individuals, unknown to wider associations. As reference, whilst not directly alike, action was taken in late apartheid by other countries' MAs to protest SA inclusion in WMA, inc BMA. Drs' unions are political because unions are political bodies by their very nature; this should not be so difficult for politicians and political commentators to understand. GMC by comparison is highly socially conservative, biases are still in place today and strategic plans within wider profession to action downstream impacts (which remain significant).  
- Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh (z"L) - beloved and senior member of medical community in Gaza, hospital director and long-standing orthopaedic surgeon. Eyewitness testimony suggests Dr. Adnan was tortured, and that it was believed he died as a result of rape perforating the large bowel, with death from resulting haemorrhage on background of poor nutrition in detention and maltreatment. This is an extremely painful manner of death. Shortly after Dr. Adnan's premature death at 49 (Apr 2024), Israeli whistleblowers came forward to report on Sde Teiman conditions and serious torture concerns (May 2024). Shortly after in Aug 2024, "Welcome To Hell" released by B'Tselem. Conditions of arrests would be replicated in later arrests of physicians in view of international digital observeration. The manner of torture and the degree of violence of rape of Palestinian people imprisoned is now subject to leaked footage from Sde Teiman, with a number of survivors having spoken about their experience to the press and to the UN, serving as witnesses as well as victims to these war crimes. Dr. Adnan (z"L) is very sadly, whilst a notable and explemary surgeon, is the victim of what will become a well-established mechanism of severe sexual violence, abuse, and torture; male medical professionals, as academic, educated men of the racialised "other" group under the illegal Israeli apartheid, are targeted with extreme violence. (cf. Fanon and descriptions of fibal years of French occupation of Algeria.)
- Note to English readers: B'Tselem are often led by and working as ex-IDF personnel, and whilst they are rejecting that violence, it needs to be balanced that they have been complicit to varying degrees, and Palestinian testimony and eyewitness accounts should be prioritised, and stand alone, not requiring "Israeli validation" to be taken on their merits as witness and survivor testimony.  
- Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya (multiple, sustained calls for international support, deranked from algorithms, IL-UK meeting not openly declared, AI responses to FCDO emails, son martyred, second arrest has led to sustained detention without known cause, due process, and with torture, medical concerns, and death of mother during detention)
- Professionals, academics, journalists: all classical first targets in historic crimes of genocide, as well as of totalitarian, fascist, and authoritarian regiemes.
- UNRWA under ix multiple times as extension of this violence; recent COGAT being COGAT increasing severity of bureaucracy as means of abusive witholding and neglect in recent days.

## 🛰️ Risks  
- Thin public provenance makes false claims plausible.  
- High-stakes complaints accepted before forensic checks.  
- Chilling effect: professionals withdraw from public discourse.  

---

## 🩺 Recommendations  
- Unions issue member protection guidance.  
- Investigations require technical provenance before sanction.  
- Vendor contracts mandate preservation.  
- Provide support and rapid redress.  
- Train investigators on C3O (containment, coercion, clone, override).
