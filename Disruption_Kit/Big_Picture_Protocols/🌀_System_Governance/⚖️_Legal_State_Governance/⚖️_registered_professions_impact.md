**Please note:** This note is currently being expanded with case examples during Iron Swords. These are graphic. Final version is not yet complete.  

I am using "martyr" as a stand-in for the Arabic phrase. I use z"L after all names of deceased persons, as this is how we would traditionally honour their memory after life. I commonly use a longer version to balance cultural norms, but these are building-notes for final version.  

Likely to split into 2 nodes.

## 🍉 Key Moments - Context  
- Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, 2023-11-17. Initially claimed as both "crossfire" ("it was kkhamas") and "non-intentional" ("we didn't mean to, honest") by IDF; pattern of explanations adjusted to narrative and reception will persist throughout Iron Swords.
- Prior NATO background: even one-off strikes merit media reporting and investigation. Ix quality arguably variable and political; not typically of debate, frequent, or outright justified. This changes over Iron Swords and Russia mirrors in Ukraine.    
- IMAJ Oct 2023 ed. openly defied Geneva Conventions and standard medical oaths (I promise you, Maimonides would not be into it). Jewish doctors and medical students, inc diaspora (eg me), instructed to offensively defend IL in narrative and digital warfare spaces.  
- **All diaspora medical professionals and students are subject to algorithmic exposure from Oct 07 2023 onwards.** This is never accounted for fully under PSED, TIP/TIP requirements, EA 2010, or ECHR, in either medical schools or in the wider NHS. Instead, UK healthcare professionals and trainees are expected to maintain ordinary performance whilst subject to "wartime" narratives and suppression. As political comparison, UK Government instructs Civil Service to fly IL flag within Oct 2023, without Palestinian flag; mortality is already disproportioned by end Oct 2023, mostly civilian martyrs. Doctors are watching other doctors be murdered, streamed to their phones based on mathematical modelling of proxies for their identity, supportee by their own governments and colleagues, in flagrant violation of IHL and international norms; the same doctors exposed to this in diaspora are expected to have no objections or emotions to this textbook example of vicarious trauma. Lawfare ongoing without institutional protections during this time to the present day. UK Government maintains hypernormalised posture of extremely implausible "plausible deniability". BMJ reports concerns on widespread impact to British Muslim doctors Jan 2024, as well as disciplinary action attached to grief, corroborated evidence from BIMA and select witness stories from academia. Specifically raised is the dehumanisation of Muslims in the UK, and use of language to discipline and undermine.  
- Trope re "hospitals as Hamas tunnels hubs" (cf HSN, Project Esther; same narratives have been used to attempt lists of all Jews at US universities under Trump administration; the perveyors of this narrative do not ptioritise Jewish safety, but weaponise fear to increase violence towards Palestinians)  
- First petition response Nov 2023, debated in UK Parliament Dec 2023: "Urge the Israel Government to allow
fuel, electricity and food into Gaza".
- UK Parliament confirms UK citizens can serve in IDF. No concerns of potential war crimes liability expressed.  
- ICJ issues precautionary measures to protect the Palestinian people from genocide in Jan 2024; all territories, all states, all organisations, all individuals liable.
- Jan 2024 BMA issues first position paper.
- Hind Rajab is murdered in Jan 2024. Emergency responders hit en route to attend. Hind can be heard being talked through the trauma of being stuck in a vehicle with the deceased bodies of six relatives, by PRCS call responders. BBC reports as "found dead", without agency. US-made anti-tank shell found, with over 300 rounds in vehicle itself; investigation conducted over following months divides international community. Due to poor linguistics within mainstream media reporting, diaspora citizens are left most impacted with little knowledge or hnderstanding from wider imperial core society. Algorithmically siloed.  
- Sieges of hospitals follow Al-Ahli Arab Hospital; Al-Shifa first two sieges in Apr 2024 are especially escalatory. Significant evidence of systematic war crimes to digital observers. Imperial core medical associations hesitate, known lawfare pressure towards individuals, unknown to wider associations. As reference, whilst not directly alike, action was taken in late apartheid by other countries' MAs to protest SA inclusion in WMA, inc BMA. Drs' unions are political because unions are political bodies by their very nature; this should not be so difficult for politicians and political commentators to understand. GMC by comparison is highly socially conservative, biases are still in place today and strategic plans within wider profession to action downstream impacts (which remain significant).
- By Mar 2024, JAMA has still published several letters with APR, and debunked claims re health facilities. BBC publishing IDF auth account of Al-Shifa seige, without reference to mass graves. No reports of the primary surveys, where doctors are found executed, bullets in midline cranium, blast injury appears point-blank range, often hands zip-tied posterior to the spine of the victim.  
- Mar 2024 BMA calls for investigation into treatment of healthcare staff; emphathises medical neutrality.
- Mar 2024: Haaretz reporting on "kill zones" policy, defence officials and retired IDF officers corroborate, concerns that civilians misclassified as enemy combatants posthomonously:  "This wasn't an official debriefing where they want you to produce
all the bodies", may their memories be a blessing.  
- Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh (z"L) - beloved and senior member of medical community in Gaza, hospital director and long-standing orthopaedic surgeon. Eyewitness testimony suggests Dr. Adnan was tortured, and that it was believed he died as a result of rape perforating the large bowel, with death from resulting haemorrhage on background of poor nutrition in detention and maltreatment. This is an extremely painful manner of death. Shortly after Dr. Adnan's premature death at 49 (Apr 2024), Israeli whistleblowers came forward to report on Sde Teiman conditions and serious torture concerns (May 2024). Shortly after in Aug 2024, "Welcome To Hell" released by B'Tselem. Conditions of arrests would be replicated in later arrests of physicians in view of international digital observeration. The manner of torture and the degree of violence of rape of Palestinian people imprisoned is now subject to leaked footage from Sde Teiman, with a number of survivors having spoken about their experience to the press and to the UN, serving as witnesses as well as victims to these war crimes. Dr. Adnan (z"L) is very sadly, whilst a notable and explemary surgeon, the victim of what will become a well-established mechanism of severe sexual violence, abuse, and torture; male medical professionals, as academic, educated men of the racialised "other" group under the illegal Israeli apartheid, are targeted with extreme violence. (cf. Fanon and descriptions of final years of French occupation of Algeria.)
- Note to English readers: B'Tselem are often led by and working as ex-IDF personnel, and whilst they are rejecting that violence, it needs to be balanced that they have been complicit to varying degrees, and Palestinian testimony and eyewitness accounts should be prioritised, and stand alone, not requiring "Israeli validation" to be taken on their merits as witness and survivor testimony.
- Apr 2024 letter from Sde Teiman whistleblower: "From the first days of the medical facility's operation until today, I have
faced serious ethical dilemmas. More than that, I am writing [this letter] to warn you that the facilities' operations do not comply with a single section
among those dealing with health in the Incarceration of Unlawful
Combatants Law" (domestic IL law).  
- Transatlantic appearance of student encampments start in Apr 2024, all host universities have investments which are illegal under ICJ provisions, all students report and document previous lobbying. Many groups have lobbied in some form (sonetimes under anti-arms), for years prior; escalation of tactics comes from feeling of urgency as British government denies reality.  
- May 2024 first British Jewish dissent in UK major media. American Jewish dissent in resignation from White House. Core justification narrative starting to break.
- ICJP seeks clarification re reconaissance flights from FCDO and MoD May 2024.
- Prominant British Rabbi livelihood threatened for intercommunity grief; June 2024. Non-Christian communities are more vulnerable to this specific pressure for pastoral staff.  
- High Court in IL orders Israeli government to provide evidence of sufficient aid, on basis of ICJ measures.  
- Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya (multiple, sustained calls for international support, deranked from algorithms, IL-UK meeting not openly declared, AI responses to FCDO emails, son martyred, second arrest has led to sustained detention without known cause, due process, and with torture, medical concerns, and death of mother during detention); Dr Hussam is still detained withoit charge and is becoming critically ill, secondary to detention conditions.  
- Professionals, academics, journalists: all classical first targets in historic crimes of genocide, as well as of totalitarian, fascist, and authoritarian regiemes.
- UNRWA under ix multiple times as extension of this violence; recent COGAT being COGAT increasing severity of bureaucracy as means of abusive witholding and neglect in recent days.
- Figures within Israeli government have introduced a death sentence law which is extremely thin in terms of accountability and oversight, targeted at Palestinians specifically. UNWRA offices, a branch of the United Nations, have been demolished in a public spectacle. Every day, violence across all the land of historic Palestine (whether it is legally classified as OPT or IL), is escalating drastically. Home demolitions across the West Bank, executions, and arbitary arrests escalate in velocity. Treatment of 48-citizenship Palestinians deteriorates. Gaza is subject to a "plan" from some of the West's most criminal men, many of whom would directly financially benefit.

## 🛰️ Risks  
- Thin public provenance makes false claims plausible.  
- High-stakes complaints accepted before forensic checks.  
- Chilling effect: professionals withdraw from public discourse.  

---

## 🩺 Recommendations  
- Unions issue member protection guidance.  
- Investigations require technical provenance before sanction.  
- Vendor contracts mandate preservation.  
- Provide support and rapid redress.  
- Train investigators on C3O (containment, coercion, clone, override).
