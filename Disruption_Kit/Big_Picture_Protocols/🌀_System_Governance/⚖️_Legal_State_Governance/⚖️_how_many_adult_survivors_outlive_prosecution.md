# ⚖️ How Many Adult Survivors Outlive Prosecution?

**First created:** 2025-12-20  
**Status:** Draft — Quantitative Risk Framing Node  
**Cluster:** System_Governance → Legal_State_Governance → Survivors & Justice Attrition

## 🧭 Orientation

This node asks a narrow but structurally important question:

> *How many survivors of childhood rape are alive, identifiable, and legally relevant **after** the criminal justice system has finished acting — or failed to act — on their case?*

The aim is not to estimate prevalence of abuse, but to understand the **size and vulnerability** of the cohort whose experiences sit *outside* active prosecution windows yet remain reputationally, legally, and politically sensitive.

This cohort is small, slow-moving, and system-dependent — which makes it easy to overlook and easy to mishandle.

---

## 🧮 Definitional Frame

**Adult survivor (for this node):**
- A person raped as a child
- Who reaches adulthood before a case is prosecuted or concluded
- Regardless of whether a report was made earlier or later

**Outlived prosecution means:**
- No charge brought, *or*
- Case discontinued, *or*
- Conviction achieved but survivor remains alive long after legal closure

This node includes **both successful and unsuccessful prosecutions**, because both generate durable data trails and reputational exposure.

---

## 📊 Survivor Base (Conservative Denominator)

Using UK survey data (ONS / CSEW), a conservative estimate is:

- **≈ 3.1 million adults** in England & Wales experienced sexual abuse before age 16  
- This includes all severities; rape is a subset  
- The figure is intentionally broad to avoid overclaiming specificity

This establishes the **maximum pool** of adult survivors whose childhood abuse could, in theory, intersect with the justice system.

---

## ⚖️ Prosecution Outcomes (Narrow Numerator)

From official criminal justice data:

- Total convictions for child sexual abuse (all offences): **~7,300 per year**
- After removing image offences and non-rape contact offences, a **generous upper-bound** estimate for:
  - **Child rape convictions involving adult survivors** is **~200–300 per year**

This is not a measured statistic; it is a *ceiling estimate* constructed from the most favourable plausible assumptions at each stage.

---

## 🧠 Temporal Reality: Survivors Vastly Outnumber Cases

At any given time:

- **Millions** of adult survivors exist
- **Hundreds** per year see a prosecution resolve
- **Thousands** more experience:
  - No charge
  - Case collapse
  - Administrative closure
  - Informal resolution
  - Or investigative stasis

This means the overwhelming majority of survivors **outlive prosecution**, either because:
- it never occurs, or
- it ends long before the survivor’s lifespan does

---

## 🔐 Small-N Exposure Risk

The subset of survivors who:
- were raped as children,
- reported as adults,
- and reached any stage of prosecution,

constitute a **small, identifiable cohort**:

- Low hundreds per year
- Sparse geographically
- Distinguishable by case features even when anonymised
- Repeatedly referenced across multiple systems (police, CPS, health, education, safeguarding)

This creates a **small-n vulnerability**:
- Fewer comparators
- Higher identifiability
- Greater impact if silenced or excluded
- Reliance on system integrity rather than redundancy

---

## 🧱 Structural Implication

Justice systems implicitly assume:
- benign actors,
- robust data controls,
- and aligned institutional incentives.

But when:
- the affected population is small,
- the data is sensitive,
- and the reputational stakes are high,

**silence does not need to be overt to be effective**.

Attrition, delay, friction, and neglect are sufficient.

---

## 🧩 Why This Node Matters

This question reframes survivor justice away from:
- “Did a conviction happen?”

toward:
- “What happens to survivors *after* the system stops paying attention?”

It highlights that:
- legal closure ≠ social closure
- data persistence outlasts prosecutions
- survivors live with outcomes far longer than institutions do

And that governance failure here is not loud.
It is quiet, technical, and cumulative.

## 📌 Status Note

This node intentionally uses **upper-bound, conservative reasoning** to avoid overstating rarity or exposure.
If anything, it likely *overestimates* how often prosecutions occur — which strengthens, rather than weakens, the structural argument.
