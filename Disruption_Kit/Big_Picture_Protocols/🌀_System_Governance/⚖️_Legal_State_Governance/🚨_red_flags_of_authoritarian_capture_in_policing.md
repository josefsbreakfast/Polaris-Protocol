# 🚨 Red Flags of Authoritarian Capture in Policing  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*A pattern-based early warning checklist for detecting authoritarian drift in policing before it becomes overt.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Authoritarian capture rarely announces itself.

It emerges through **patterns** — subtle shifts in discipline, enforcement, language, and institutional behaviour that are individually deniable but collectively diagnostic.

This tool is designed to help:
- oversight bodies,
- journalists,
- unions,
- internal reformers,
- community advocates,

identify **early warning signs** without needing proof of intent, ideology, or conspiracy.

No single red flag is decisive.  
**Clusters matter.**

---

## 🚨 How to Use This Tool  

- Look for **repetition**, not one-off incidents.  
- Track **who is affected**, not just what happened.  
- Compare **stated values** with **operational outcomes**.  
- Treat resistance, burnout, and silence as signals.

This is a **diagnostic**, not an accusation.

---

## 🔎 Red Flag Cluster 1: Selective Discipline  

Indicators include:
- faster or harsher discipline for ethical, community-facing officers,
- delayed or minimised consequences for abusive or aligned officers,
- informal sanctions replacing formal accountability,
- discipline framed as “attitude” or “tone” rather than conduct.

**Interpretation:**  
Discipline is being used to shape behaviour, not uphold standards.

---

## 🔎 Red Flag Cluster 2: Empathy Punished  

Watch for:
- de-escalation framed as weakness,
- community engagement treated as bias,
- officers criticised for “over-identification” with marginalised groups,
- emotional intelligence reframed as unprofessionalism.

**Interpretation:**  
Moral friction is being removed to simplify enforcement.

---

## 🔎 Red Flag Cluster 3: Enforcement Asymmetry  

Patterns include:
- aggressive policing of protestors or marginalised groups,
- low urgency toward well-resourced or legally insulated actors,
- repeated classification of organised violence as “nuisance”,
- enforcement justified by ease rather than harm.

**Interpretation:**  
Capacity stress is distorting legal equality.

---

## 🔎 Red Flag Cluster 4: Narrative Flattening  

Listen for language shifts such as:
- “both sides are as bad as each other” under asymmetric violence,
- reframing political or ideological violence as generic disorder,
- avoidance of naming far-right or authoritarian threats,
- emphasis on optics over legality.

**Interpretation:**  
Language is being used to erase power differentials.

---

## 🔎 Red Flag Cluster 5: Ethical Attrition Signals  

Watch for:
- disproportionate exit of ethical or community-embedded officers,
- early retirement spikes following controversy,
- burnout concentrated in specific teams,
- silence where concern was previously voiced.

**Interpretation:**  
Internal resistance is leaving rather than being removed.

---

## 🧠 Reading the Pattern  

Authoritarian capture does not require:
- ideological alignment,
- explicit orders,
- or uniform behaviour.

It requires:
- stress,
- selective pressure,
- and tolerance of asymmetry.

When **multiple clusters** appear together, drift is likely underway.

---

## 🚦 What This Tool Is *Not*  

This checklist does **not**:
- prove intent,
- assign blame,
- replace investigation.

It **does**:
- surface risk,
- justify deeper scrutiny,
- and counter claims that concerns are “isolated” or “emotional”.

*🚨 Red Flags of Authoritarian Capture in Policing* is a living tool within the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It provides a practical, pattern-based framework for detecting early-stage institutional drift before overt authoritarian control is established.
