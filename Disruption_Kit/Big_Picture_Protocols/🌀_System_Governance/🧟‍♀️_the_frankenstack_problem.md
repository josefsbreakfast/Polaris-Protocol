# 🧟‍♀️ The Frankenstack Problem 

**First created:** 2025-08-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-29

*How UK counter-extremism, safeguarding, and healthcare R&D created hybrid surveillance stacks without regulation — leaving survivors as live test subjects.*

## 🧟‍♀️ Definition: The Frankenstack Problem  
A **Frankenstack** = a stitched-together system of mismatched forks from different academic departments, contractors, and policy agendas.  

- Each component may be defensible in isolation  
- When duct-taped together, they form an **illegal hybrid pipeline**  
- Survivors, marginalised groups, and “high data yield” individuals become **the easiest live test cases**  

Frankenstacks don’t emerge from one master plan. They appear because no one wants to take responsibility for the seams.  

---

## 🏛 Origins in Prevent  
- **Prevent** began as counter-terrorism → then reframed as “safeguarding”  
- Universities funded to “detect radicalisation” online  
- Voice, behaviour, and metadata capture justified under **security exemptions**  
- These systems were later rebranded for health/social care, sidestepping medical regulation and ethics review  

Prevent became the policy *glue* that allowed forks to migrate across domains.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) Scandals & Safeguarding Science  
- Post-CSE scandals, major funding poured into “safeguarding science”  
- Behavioural surveillance tools tested under the guise of protecting children  
- Survivors re-exploited: lived trauma became **training data** for forked models  
- Function creep became normalised: **terrorism → safeguarding → healthcare → social policy**  

Each scandal was met not with accountability, but with another patchwork system layered on top.

## ⚙️ Anatomy of a Frankenstack  
- **Engineering fork** → signal processing, recommender systems, voice capture  
- **Behavioural fork** → radicalisation models, online extremism detection, nudging  
- **Healthcare fork** → “wellbeing apps,” safeguarding dashboards, “resilience” interventions  
- **Policy glue** → Prevent, safeguarding legislation, ethics committees with loopholes  

**Endpoint:** A very, very bad sandwich.  

---

## ⚖️ Why It’s Illegal  
- **Consent collapse** → data re-used outside original purpose  
- **GDPR violations** → profiling and special category data processed without lawful basis  
- **AI Act breach** → high-risk AI deployed without conformity assessment  
- **MHRA evasion** → unregistered “software-as-medical-device” deployed on real people  

Every seam is a breach; the whole is a structural violation.  

---

## 🧬 Survivor Impact  
- Feels like a *targeted conspiracy*, but in practice = **accidental-on-purpose wreckage**  
- Survivors become “proof of concept” subjects  
- Forks reinforce trauma through nudging, echoing, and surveillance harassment  
- Isolation deepens because the damage feels too messy to explain

## 📜 Annex A: CPS–Frankenstack Timeline (2008–2015)  

### 2008  
- **Starmer appointed DPP.** CPS already embedded with MI5/Home Office on CT cases. Metadata use increasing  

### 2009–2010  
- **Early Prevent pilots** embed in education + health  
- CPS backs terrorism cases on online behaviour  
- ESRC/Home Office fund radicalisation detection R&D  

### 2011  
- **Prevent Review** reframes as safeguarding  
- CPS adopts safeguarding language in risk logic  
- **VAWG strategy** launched by CPS  

### 2012  
- **CSE prosecutions collapse** (Rochdale, Oxfordshire). CPS under fire  
- Metadata + behavioural inference normalised in CT  
- Horizon/EPSRC projects seeded at Nottingham + Hallam  

### 2013  
- **Starmer exits CPS**  
- Prevent embedding accelerates  
- ESRC funds → **CREST**  
- Safeguarding failures feed “science-based” fixes  

### 2014–2015  
- **Rotherham inquiry explodes**  
- **Prevent statutory duty (2015)**  
- Frankenstack cemented: safeguarding + CT + academia fused under “risk”

## 📂 Annex B: Live Evidence Log – SAR/FOI Trail  

[Additional, previously stalling, SAR acknowledged during redrafting this node; 20 Aug 2025.]  

**Polaris Note:**  
- This shows stack mechanics at work: GDPR and several regulatory oversight mechanisms  
- Delay tactics increase liability, as external regulators are already notified  
- Survivors forcing disclosure = the same pressure point that exposes Frankenstack’s design  

---

## 📌 Polaris Conclusion  

The Frankenstack is not a mythic conspiracy — it is a product of:  
1. Legal validation of metadata as evidence  
2. Prevent embedding into safeguarding  
3. Safeguarding failures that drove “solutions”  
4. Cross-disciplinary R&D pipelines  

**Survivors = live test cases**  
**SARs/FOIs = live faultlines**  

The Frankenstack collapses under its own contradictions when those inside force disclosure and stitch the paper trail to the structural record.

*The Frankenstack Problem* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how counter-extremism, safeguarding, and healthcare pipelines fused into hybrid surveillance stacks, with survivors as live subjects.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
