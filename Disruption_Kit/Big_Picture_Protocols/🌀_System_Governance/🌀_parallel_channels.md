# 🌀 Parallel Channels  
**First created:** 2025-09-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*Duplication of process where survivors are bounced between contradictory pathways — a containment treadmill.*

## 🔀 Core Idea  

Parallel channels occur when **two or more systems claim to offer help or oversight** — but in practice, they deflect responsibility back and forth.  
It’s a **containment loop disguised as support**.  

Survivors are told:  
- “That’s not our remit.”  
- “You need to go through this channel first.”  
- “That’s being handled by another team.”  

But all channels lead back to the same stuck point.

## 🔄 Containment Treadmill  

| **Path A** | **Path B** | **Outcome** |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Internal complaint | External ombudsman | Each says the other has primacy |
| Social care | Legal route | Delays, costs, confusion |
| HR grievance | Whistleblowing hotline | Splits the claim, weakens impact |
| Police referral | Professional regulator | Jurisdiction dispute |
| MP letter | FOIA/SAR | Misfiled or delayed |

## 📉 Impact on Survivors  

- **Cognitive load**: constant navigation, repetition, contradiction.  
- **Delays**: each bounce adds months.  
- **Disempowerment**: survivor starts doubting their own sense of injustice.  
- **Data fragmentation**: evidence split across siloes.  
- **Policy insulation**: institution looks busy while doing nothing.  

---

## 🛠 Countermeasures  

- **One-touch escalation routes**: single intake team that coordinates behind the scenes.  
- **Jurisdiction maps**: public guides that show which route is valid, when, and why.  
- **Data pooling**: let users port evidence between channels.  
- **Audit flags**: track looped referrals as risk signals, not admin quirks.

*Parallel Channels* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how survivors are trapped in duplicated intake pathways that lead nowhere — containment through contradiction.
