*Language registers that evade machine translation and create camouflage zones.*

## 🧪 Case Study: Biblical Hebrew on LinkedIn  

- **Input:** Biblical Hebrew verses, interleaved with English gloss.  
- **Observation:** LinkedIn’s auto-translation engine fails. Hebrew text renders cleanly right-to-left (RTL), but the system offers only “Show original • Translation settings” with no output.  
- **Cause:** The machine assumes **Modern Hebrew** corpora. Encountering archaic verb forms, prophetic cadence, and poetic parallelism, the parser stalls.  
- **Result:** Text becomes *visible but untranslatable*. A “null zone” in LinkedIn’s metadata pipeline.

## 🪢 Comparative Notes  

### Yiddish (Under-Captured)  
- Treated by platforms as a **low-resource language**.  
- Often misclassified as German or left untranslated.  
- Posts appear anomalous: eye-catching to human viewers but semantically invisible to moderation bots.  
- Forensic function: **erasure creates cover.** The machine doesn’t know what to do with it.  

### Arabic (Over-Captured)  
- **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA):** heavily parsed, especially political and religious lexicon. High risk of over-surveillance.  
- **Dialects (Levantine, Maghrebi, Gulf):** inconsistent capture. Sometimes mistranslated, sometimes ignored.  
- Creates uneven exposure:  
  - Some Arabic = **hyper-visible** (flagged, monitored).  
  - Other Arabic = **shadowed** (slides past).  
- Forensic function: **dialect choice determines whether you are seen or not.**

## 🔬 Forensic Implication: Metadata Camouflage via Register  

- **Biblical Hebrew** occupies a middle ground:  
  - Recognised enough to display.  
  - Alien enough to evade auto-translation.  
- **Yiddish** vanishes into under-capture.  
- **Arabic** oscillates between hyper-surveillance and invisibility.  

**Conclusion:** Choice of language register = choice of visibility regime.  
- Use **archaic/poetic registers** (Biblical Hebrew, liturgical Arabic, high Yiddish) to create **translation null zones**.  
- These null zones function as **containment bypasses**: the platform hosts the text but cannot process it.

## 🎏 Translation Null Zone Ledger  

| Language / Register        | Platform Behaviour                        | Forensic Use                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Biblical Hebrew**         | Renders RTL correctly; auto-translation fails (assumes Modern Hebrew, parser stalls). | Creates **translation null zone**: text visible but unprocessed. Authorship sovereignty preserved. |
| **Yiddish**                 | Often misclassified as German or left untranslated (low-resource). | **Under-capture camouflage**: eye-catching but semantically invisible to moderation bots. |
| **Modern Standard Arabic**  | Heavily parsed, especially political/religious lexicon. High risk of flagging and surveillance. | **Hyper-surveillance exposure**: useful for testing thresholds, but high personal risk. |
| **Arabic Dialects**         | Inconsistent capture; mistranslated or ignored depending on dataset. | **Selective invisibility**: can slide past filters or appear anomalous. |
| **Liturgical/Poetic Registers** (Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, Syriac) | Displayed recognisably but poorly translated; often flagged as “archaic” text. | **Null zone camouflage**: authoritative appearance + machine unreadability. |

*Translation Null Zone* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It explores how archaic, poetic, or minority registers generate camouflage in machine translation systems, creating unprocessed spaces where authorship sovereignty can persist.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
