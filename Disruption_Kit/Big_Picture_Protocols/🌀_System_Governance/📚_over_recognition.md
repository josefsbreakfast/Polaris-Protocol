# 📚 Over Recognition  

**First created:** 2025-09-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  

*PR exercises and listening sessions that absorb critique but never act — recognition as containment.*  

---

## 🌐 Summary  

Over recognition is when institutions appear to listen, acknowledge, or celebrate voices — but use that recognition as a **buffer against change**.  
It is not silence. It is the opposite: too much listening, with no structural shift.  

---

## 🧩 Mechanisms  

- **PR spotlighting** → survivors invited to panels, focus groups, photo ops, but decisions remain unchanged.  
- **Listening sessions as sedation** → consultation is endless; action deferred.  
- **Tokenisation** → a few individuals are elevated to signal “we heard you,” while systemic demands are sidelined.  
- **Absorption of critique** → institutions reframe criticism as evidence of “engagement,” neutralising its edge.  
- **Recognition as liability management** → acknowledgment used to forestall litigation or prevent escalation.

## 📡 Survivor Effects  

- Emotional whiplash: being seen but not acted upon.  
- Exhaustion from repeated retelling with no repair.  
- Distrust deepens when “we listened” is the final product.  
- Communities fracture when tokens are elevated over collective voice.  

---

## 🧭 Diagnostic Cues  

- High visibility of survivor stories in institutional PR without parallel reform.  
- Multiple “listening exercises” with no published outcome.  
- Reports acknowledging systemic issues but offering only cosmetic recommendations.  
- Awards, recognition events, or symbolic gestures substituting for material redress.

*📚 Over Recognition* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how institutions weaponise listening and acknowledgment as forms of containment, substituting symbolic recognition for material change.
