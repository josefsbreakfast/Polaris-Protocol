# 🧠 Didn’t Apply Brain Loop  
**First created:** 2025-09-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-14  
*How predator paranoia becomes institutional “intelligence” through DARVO echo chambers*  

---

## Summary  
This node documents the absurd logic spiral where a predator’s DARVO defence (“she’s obsessed with me”) is treated as actionable evidence.  
Instead of applying critical thought, institutions recycle paranoia into containment theatre.  
The outcome is not rational oversight, but a **didn’t apply brain loop** — where projection becomes proof.

## Key Dynamics  

- **Predator Paranoia:**  
  - *“She’ll always hate me.”*  
  - *“Everyone who criticises me is obsessed.”*  

- **Institutional Uptake:**  
  - Bureaucrats treat projection as data.  
  - “Obsession” mapped to CVE heuristics.  
  - Loops validated in surveillance files.  

- **Self-Confirming Spiral:**  
  - Survivor resists → logged as instability.  
  - Noise injections (pornography, charm offensive) amplify confusion.  
  - Predator’s DARVO appears “proven” by the very containment it inspired.

## Experiential Effect  

Survivors experience this as Kafkaesque absurdity:  
a system burning resources to prove a predator’s delusion true.  

> *“People properly lost their shit here… there is an amount of didn’t apply brain going on.”*

## 🏮 Footer  

*Didn’t Apply Brain Loop* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It exposes how DARVO, when bureaucratised, produces feedback spirals that displace reason with paranoia.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
