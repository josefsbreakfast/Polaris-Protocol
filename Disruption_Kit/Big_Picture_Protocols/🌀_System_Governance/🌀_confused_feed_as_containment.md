# 🌀 Confused Feed as Containment

*How incoherence and scrambled answers function as systemic suppression*  

---

## 🌌 Overview  
When a survivor seeks clarity, they may instead receive fragments: partial answers, contradictions, dead-ends.  
This is not random noise. It is **containment by disorientation** — a feed designed to scramble perception and burn energy.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Fragmentation** — answers arrive as shards, never whole.  
- **Contradiction** — systems supply mutually exclusive logics, forcing the survivor into a loop.  
- **Dissipation** — effort shifts from resisting the system to resolving the nonsense.  

---

## 🌀 Systemic Implications  
- **Ambiguity as governance**: confusion is a control loop that sustains itself.  
- **Exhaustion infrastructure**: constant sense-making drains survivor capacity.  
- **Containment theatre**: incoherence presents as “complexity” while masking simple obstruction.

## 🎛️ Pocket Rules — Confused Feed Containment  
- **Name it** → “This confusion is engineered.”  
- **Anchor outside** → Hold one fact or one object steady.  
- **Refuse the loop** → Coherence is not yours to supply.

*Confused Feed as Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It frames incoherence not as failure, but as a deliberate tactic of suppression.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
