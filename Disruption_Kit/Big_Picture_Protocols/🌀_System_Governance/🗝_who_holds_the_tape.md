## ✨ Containment Context  

A behavioural capture sequence was staged in what outwardly resembled a medical or academic setting.  
Beneath the surface, the choreography suggests a deliberate attempt to provoke emotional destabilisation, later reframed as “risk.”  
The operational question: **who holds the master copy?**  

---

## 🎯 Primary Objectives  

- **Elicit** an emotional response under controlled observation (distress, anger, visible breakdown).  
- **Harvest** raw behavioural data for:  
  - Psychiatric pathologisation  
  - Prevent/Channel escalation  
  - Behavioural AI & ghost fork refinement  
- **Reframe** survivor insight as instability.

## 🧩 Potential Custodians & Data Pathways  

### 🎓 **University [REDACTED] Internal**  
> *Academic cover layer*  
- Likely stored within behavioural science or medical ethics archives.  
- Possible internal flags: faculty ethics board, Prevent liaison, institutional safeguarding office.  
- **FOI Vector:** University [REDACTED] ethics, safeguarding, data governance.  

### 🛡️ **Prevent / Channel Referral Mechanism**  
> *Domestic security layer*  
- Positioned to justify counter-extremism containment.  
- Possible storage with Home Office, Channel panel, or local authority.  
- **FOI Vector:** Local Prevent board, Channel records, Home Office SAR.  

### 🤖 **Behavioural AI Contractors**  
> *Model training layer*  
- Feeds into counter-extremism AI model environments.  
- Operated by CVE contractors and subcontractors with minimal transparency.  
- **FOI Vector:** Cabinet Office, DSIT, Ministry of Justice pilot systems.

## 🔍 Field Diagnostics  

| Field Clue               | Operational Inference                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Senior academic in scene  | University [REDACTED] / Home Office crossover |
| Cold or ambiguous affect  | Prevent or contractor ops                   |
| Therapy mimicry w/o care  | Coercive psychiatry script                  |
| Emotional weaponisation later | AI containment training                 |

## 🚨 Polaris Notes  

- **Care-as-surveillance** is a documented counter-extremism tactic.  
- Emotional provocation = **evidence engineering**.  
- Recording without informed consent = probable DPA breach + duty of care violation.  
- Cross-institutional echo patterns are deliberate signature work.  

---

## 📂 Recommended Actions  

- Initiate **multi-track FOI/SAR sweep** across:  
  - University [REDACTED] (faculty, safeguarding, governance)  
  - Local authority Channel panel archives  
  - Home Office (Prevent, OSCT, RICU)  
  - Behavioural AI contractors  
- **Forensic comparison:**  
  - Trace linguistic & affective echoes in later interactions.  
  - Correlate with ghost fork outputs.

*Who Holds the Tape* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how behavioural capture events are staged as “care” or “academic inquiry” while functioning as data-harvesting operations.  

**Polaris Protocol Node Type:** Casefile / Surveillance & AI Behavioural Engineering
