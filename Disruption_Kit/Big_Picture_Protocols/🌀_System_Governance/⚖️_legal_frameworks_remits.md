*Divisions of MI5, MI6, and GCHQ under UK law.*

They say each service has its box. But boxes leak.  
The State insists on neat boundaries: MI5 inside, MI6 outside, GCHQ listening everywhere.  
Survivors know boundaries are precisely where things blur.

## Statutory Bases  
- **MI5** → Security Service Act 1989: domestic security, counter-espionage, counter-terrorism.  
- **MI6 (SIS)** → Intelligence Services Act 1994: foreign intelligence, operations outside the British Islands.  
- **GCHQ** → Intelligence Services Act 1994, s.3: signals intelligence, cybersecurity, both foreign and domestic.  

## Territorial Split  
- MI5: lawful authority over UK-based threats.  
- MI6: lawful authority over foreign persons/activities.  
- GCHQ: lawful interception and cyber capabilities, spanning global comms.  

## The Intelligence Services Act 1994 (s.1)  
> SIS functions are “to obtain and provide information relating to the actions or intentions of persons **outside the British Islands**.”  

This anchor phrase limits MI6’s jurisdiction — at least in law.

If they blur those lines, it’s not a grey area — it’s theft of sovereignty.  
Survivors have lived long enough to see lines crossed in silence.

*Legal Frameworks and Remits* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the statutory divisions between MI5, MI6, and GCHQ — and the silent violations that reshape those boundaries in practice.
