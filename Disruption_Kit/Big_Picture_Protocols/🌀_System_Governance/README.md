# 🌀 System & Governance  

**First created:** 2025-08-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-27  
*How the systems we use interlace with what controls and powers them.*  

---

## ✨ Scope  

This cluster holds doctrines and diagnostics on how systems govern behaviour through infrastructure, bureaucracy, and narrative control.  
It maps the architecture of containment — from algorithmic nudges to surveillance stacks — and records how governance operates at both the visible and hidden layers.  

---

## 🦚 Core Themes  

- **Containment Logic** → how empathy, delay, or translation are weaponised as governance tools.  
- **Infrastructure** → surveillance, intake gates, contract traces, and technical choke points.  
- **Narrative Management** → amnesia design, perception gaps, and clone-friendly architectures.  
- **Ownership** → who holds the tape, who sets the frame, and how choice is structured.
