# 🌀 Systems & Governance  
**First created:** 2025-08-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  

*How the systems we use interlace with what controls and powers them.*  

---

## ✨ Scope  

This cluster holds doctrines and diagnostics on how systems govern behaviour through infrastructure, bureaucracy, and narrative control.<br>
It maps the architecture of containment — from algorithmic nudges to surveillance stacks — and records how governance operates at both the visible and hidden layers.

## 🦚 Core Themes  

- **Containment Logic** → empathy as throttle, translation collapse, bureaucratic paradoxes.  
- **Infrastructure** → surveillance, intake gates, procurement contracts, and metadata choke points.  
- **Narrative Management** → curated amnesia, perception gaps, clone-friendly architectures.  
- **Ownership** → who holds the tape, who sets the frame, and how choice is structured.

*🌀 Systems & Governance* is a living cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps systemic containment architectures, showing how infrastructure, narrative, and bureaucracy converge to throttle survivor agency.
