# 🌀 Systems & Governance  
**First created:** 2025-08-27  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*How the systems we use interlace with what controls and powers them.*

---

## ✨ Scope  

**Systems & Governance** examines how containment architectures replicate through law, bureaucracy, infrastructure, and narrative.  
It maps both the official mechanisms of control and their absurd, accidental, and satirical echoes — from real oversight frameworks to parody ministries of biscuits.

## 🦚 Core Themes  

- **Containment Logic** → empathy as throttle, translation collapse, bureaucratic paradoxes.  
- **Legal & State Governance** → permissioning, oversight, and accountability theatre.  
- **Ownership & Control** → who holds the process, who owns the decision.  
- **Narrative Management** → curated amnesia, perception gaps, clone-friendly architectures.  
- **Infrastructure Procurement** → surveillance stacks, vendor contracts, and metadata choke points.  
- **Development & Experimentation** → innovation as cover for containment; failure as resource.  
- **Antarctic Biscuit Defence Directory** → the bureaucratic parody of defence logic — biscuit as classified object.  
- **Angleland Ahoy** → a satirical adventure through policy absurdities and civic farce.

*🌀 Systems & Governance* is a living cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps systemic containment architectures — and their parodies — showing how law, infrastructure, and absurdity co-produce the governance of everyday life.
