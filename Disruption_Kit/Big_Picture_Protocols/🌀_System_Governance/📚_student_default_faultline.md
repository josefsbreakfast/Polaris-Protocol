*How institutions embed user-blame into everyday errors*

---

## ✦ Overview  
When systems misfire, universities often default to one explanation: the student is wrong. Server errors, data gaps, or systemic failures get reframed as “user mistake.”  

This is not always a bad actor’s plot. It is the **culture of institutional reflex**:  
- Student is always the problem.  
- Proof of innocence must be “tighter” than proof of fault.  
- Glitches become evidence of student unreliability.  

## ✦ Survivor Account  
> “University of Nottingham felt like an abusive relationship. But I don’t think the email errors were always deliberate. More likely, they had server/data problems — and a culture that assumes the student is at fault. That architecture of blame fits their institution too well.”  

Exposure risk scales with:  
- Number of services one is forced through.  
- Disability/medical complexity.  
- Volume of data touchpoints.

This file records a structural pattern: **default blame architecture**.  
It captures how negligence and coercive nudging combine to erase systemic accountability.
