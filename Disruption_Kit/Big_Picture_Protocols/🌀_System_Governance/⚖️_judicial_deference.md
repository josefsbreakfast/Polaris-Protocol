*Courts outsourcing responsibility back to the executive, reinforcing systemic impunity*

## 🧭 Concept  

Judicial deference refers to the pattern where **courts refrain from fully scrutinising executive power**, especially in national security, surveillance, or foreign policy cases.  
Rather than act as a check, they become a **relay switch**, validating decisions already made elsewhere.  

This can result in:  
- **Rubber-stamping** executive warrants  
- **Deferring to “expertise”** instead of examining fact  
- **Blocking disclosure** on grounds of secrecy  
- **Reinforcing impunity** by denying standing or remedies  

This deference is not neutral. It sustains impunity.  
It’s the legal form of looking away.

*Judicial Deference* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It tracks how courts sometimes fail to check state overreach — and how legal passivity enables systemic harm.
