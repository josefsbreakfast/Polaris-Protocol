*Big Picture Protocol node — learning from UK precedents to frame hybrid compensation for systemic harms.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Simple banded compensation risks underpaying catastrophic harms.  
Full assessment risks delay and overload.  
UK practice shows a **hybrid model** balances fairness with feasibility.  

---

## 📍 UK Precedents  
- **Post Office Horizon**: fixed offers + full claims track.  
- **Infected Blood**: interim tariffs + assessed top-ups.  
- **Windrush**: rigid banding criticised as under-compensating.  

---

## 📍 Models Considered  
1. **Pure tariff** → fast, predictable, but underpays extremes.  
2. **Pure assessment** → individual justice, but costly and slow.  
3. **Hybrid (recommended)** → banded awards + tribunal-assessed damages for catastrophic harms.  

---

## 📈 Strategic Insight  
- Hybrid models already in UK use.  
- Delivers justice to most harmed without overwhelming system.  
- Protects finances by banding majority while recognising outliers.
