## 🛰️ Orientation  
‘If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone…’ Kipling’s most famous stanza describes containment as metabolism: will outliving belief.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Post-purpose Functioning:** systems running on discipline alone.
- **Ethics of Exhaustion:** the moment maintenance replaces meaning.
- **Containment to Identity:** the survivor becomes the system they sustain.
