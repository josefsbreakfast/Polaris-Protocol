# ❓ Override Question as Silence Breaker  
**First created:** 2025-09-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Professional overrides as both a safeguard and a diagnostic signal of systemic silence.*

---

## 🌱 Scope  

Every structured risk system has a *final question*:  
*“Do you believe further action is needed, regardless of the score?”*  

This “override” legitimises **Type 1 pattern recognition** (*Thinking, Fast and Slow*). It makes space for professional intuition — the noticing of *“something isn’t right”* before metrics catch up.  

---

## ✨ Functions  

- **Safety net:** ensures concern cannot be buried under thresholds.  
- **Bias exposure:** shows whether concerns are consistently ignored, minimised, or punished.  
- **Forensic marker:** absence of overrides in high-risk environments is itself suspicious — silence masquerading as safety.

## 🧠 Intuition Literacy  

Override depends on trusting Type 1 recognition.  

- Marginalised communities often display sharpened intuition, not as privilege, but as survival adaptation.  
- The skill compensates for structural hostility; it should never be wielded as a cudgel against those who don’t demonstrate it.  
- Its presence testifies to the *stress load of discrimination*: people must carry extra perceptual labour simply to progress.  

Intuition shows up across domains:  
- Nurses noticing decline before charts.  
- Sherlock Holmes reading traces like a conjurer.  
- Tarot readers or psychics naming patterns without formal data.  

👉 Intuition literacy is the invisible counterpart to data literacy. Both are needed to break silence.

*❓ Override Question as Silence Breaker* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates professional override as both a safeguard and a probe for forensic silence.
