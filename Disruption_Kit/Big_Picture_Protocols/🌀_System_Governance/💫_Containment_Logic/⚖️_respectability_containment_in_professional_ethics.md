**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-19  
*How professional codes of “ethics” and “civility” are deployed to neutralise dissent and maintain ideological order.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
Professional codes of ethics claim to safeguard integrity and civility, yet often act as containment architecture: behavioural expectations that reward conformity and punish truth-telling.  
Respectability is how institutions convert moral courage into misconduct.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Tone Policing as Discipline:** Civility as compliance tool.  
- **Ethics as Optics:** Integrity equated with institutional loyalty.  
- **Gatekeeping through Language:** Dissent reframed as unprofessionalism.  
- **Virtue Inflation:** Principle statements replace accountability.  
- **Containment Loop:** Respectability → access → silence → reward.
