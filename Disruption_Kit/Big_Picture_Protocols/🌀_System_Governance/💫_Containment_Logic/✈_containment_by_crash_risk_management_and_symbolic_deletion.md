# ✈ Containment by Crash — Risk Management and Symbolic Deletion  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Disaster as the reset function of authoritarian infrastructure.*  

---

## 🛰 Orientation  
A crash is never only mechanical. It is an administrative convenience — the erasure of a ledger, the silencing of dissenting contractors, the clean-slate budget cycle disguised as condolence. To model risk in such systems is to map **where deletion masquerades as fate**.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Systemic risk as policy:** engineered failure for bureaucratic renewal.  
- **Symbolic deletion:** catastrophe replacing audit.  
- **Containment loop:** crash → mourning → reconstruction → amnesia.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. The Economy of Loss  
Each major disaster triggers procurement rounds, loyalty tests, and leadership reshuffles. Risk thus funds itself.  

### 2. Crash as Compliance Tool  
Fear of catastrophe keeps institutions in alignment. The system survives by demonstrating what happens when one node fails.  

### 3. Deletion and Dataflow  
Digital systems replicate this pattern: corrupted logs, overwritten registries, “archival rot” treated as inevitability rather than intervention. Containment by crash is the offline ancestor of metadata sabotage.

*✈ Containment by Crash — Risk Management and Symbolic Deletion* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how engineered accidents act as a cleansing mechanism for systems that cannot admit fault.
