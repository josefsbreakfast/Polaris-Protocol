# 💫 Containment Logic  
**First created:** 2025-10-13  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*Behavioural governance and operational feedback loops that preserve the illusion of control while deferring accountability.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

**Containment Logic** sits inside *[🌀 Systems & Governance](../README.md)* as the **behavioural-operations layer**.  
Where *[⚖️ Legal & State Governance](../⚖️_Legal_State_Governance/README.md)* studies rule-sets and *[👑 Ownership & Control](../👑_Ownership_Control/README.md)* maps custody of process,  
**Containment Logic** captures how *habits, audits, and rituals* become soft enforcement.  

It examines how systems appear self-correcting but are, in practice, self-preserving — converting duty of care into duty of containment.

---

## ✨ Key Themes  

- **Procedural Fog & Ambiguity** — policy as camouflage.  
- **Algorithmic Pacing** — rate-limit and throttle as emotional control.  
- **Tick-Box Governance** — audit satisfaction over reality.  
- **Patch-Repair Mythology** — maintenance as ritual, not remedy.  
- **Cognitive Load & Delay** — tired minds comply.  
- **Due Diligence Loops** — endless reviews masking incapacity.  
- **Override Moments** — precise questions that puncture bureaucratic theatre.

## 🧭 Routing Notes  

If a node focuses on **procedural law or statutory architecture**, route to *[⚖️ Legal & State Governance](../⚖️_Legal_State_Governance/README.md)*.  
If it explores **custody or remit collision**, route to *[👑 Ownership & Control](../👑_Ownership_Control/README.md)*.  
If it addresses **behavioural nudge or compliance culture**, it belongs here.  
If it deals with **physical delivery systems or contracts**, cross-link to *[🛰️ Infrastructure Procurement](../🛰️_Infrastructure_Procurement/README.md)*.

*💫 Containment Logic* is a living sub-cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the mechanics by which systems simulate responsiveness while sustaining containment.
