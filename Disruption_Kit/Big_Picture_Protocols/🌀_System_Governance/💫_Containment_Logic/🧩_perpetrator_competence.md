# 🧩 Perpetrator Competence & System Harm  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*Victims do not fail — perpetrators succeed.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Institutional narratives fixate on victim behaviour:  
“Why didn’t she run?”  
“Why didn’t they say something sooner?”

This is not only wrong — it is dangerous.  
This node shifts the lens to **perpetrator competence**: the skill, calculation, manipulation, and environmental engineering that make coercion succeed.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Perpetrators are skilled at manipulating systems.  
- Victim-blaming hides architecture of abuse.  
- Coercion works because it is designed to.  
- System weakness amplifies perpetrator ability.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Coercion Is a Skillset  
Perpetrators excel in:
- narrative control,  
- environmental manipulation,  
- grooming,  
- impression management,  
- reading vulnerability,  
- exploiting system gaps,  
- controlling information flow.

These are skills — not accidents.

### 2. System Harm Enables Perpetrator Harm  
Where systems have:
- untraceable flagging routes,  
- anonymous escalation,  
- lack of oversight,  
- fear-based workplace cultures,  
- gender bias,  
- no correction mechanisms,

perpetrators thrive effortlessly.

### 3. Why Victim-Blaming Is Structural  
Victim-blaming:
- protects perpetrators,  
- hides institutional failures,  
- relieves systems of responsibility,  
- exaggerates individual choice over structural constraint.

### 4. Shifting the Lens  
Assess:
- “How was this allowed?”  
- “What system gaps were exploited?”  
- “Who benefitted from silence?”  
- “What institutional conditions enabled this?”

We fix harm by studying perpetrators — not victims.
