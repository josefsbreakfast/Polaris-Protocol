*How a single governance error can compound, scale, and enlarge over time.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines how **an initial political or governance error**, made under one cabinet, can **persist, amplify, and distort decision-making** long after the originating actors have left office.

The focus is not blame, but **error propagation** — how unresolved harm becomes structurally embedded, forcing later institutions to manage consequences rather than correct causes.

---

## 🧩 The originating error

Most large-scale governance failures do not begin with malice.  
They begin with a **single defensive decision**, such as:

- choosing silence over explanation,
- classifying information to avoid immediate political risk,
- delaying disclosure “temporarily”,
- or suppressing an internal warning to maintain cohesion.

At the time, the decision appears contained.  
In reality, it creates **latent instability**.

---

## 🌀 How harm scales over time

Once an error is left unresolved, it begins to enlarge through predictable stages:

1. **Normalisation**  
   The decision becomes “how things are done”.

2. **Inheritance**  
   Subsequent cabinets inherit the outcome, not the rationale.

3. **Risk inversion**  
   Correcting the error becomes riskier than maintaining it.

4. **Procedural hardening**  
   Temporary measures calcify into policy, practice, or classification.

5. **Downstream harm**  
   Individuals and institutions experience consequences without context.

By this point, no one feels responsible — but everyone feels constrained.

---

## 🧿 The silence multiplier

Silence is not neutral.  
Each cycle of non-disclosure:

- increases legal exposure,
- widens the group of affected parties,
- and raises the political cost of correction.

What began as *damage control* becomes **harm multiplication**.

At scale, silence transforms from a shield into a liability.

---

## 🏛️ Why later cabinets struggle to undo it

Later administrations face a dilemma:

- Declassify or disclose, and risk:
  - embarrassment,
  - liability,
  - diplomatic fallout,
  - or exposure of predecessor error

- Maintain silence, and inherit:
  - regulatory breach,
  - institutional paralysis,
  - and moral injury within the system

This is how **past errors conscript the present**.

---

## ⚖️ The regulatory collision point

Eventually, unresolved harm intersects with:

- SARs or FOIs,
- litigation,
- whistleblowing,
- or regulatory oversight.

At this stage, the issue is no longer historical.

It is **active non-compliance**.

The original error may belong to a previous cabinet —  
but responsibility for correction belongs to the current one.

---

## 🧠 What this framing achieves

This model:

- avoids scapegoating individuals,
- explains why “everyone knows but no one fixes it”,
- clarifies why institutions appear defensive rather than malicious,
- and re-centres accountability on **repair, not blame**.

It also makes clear that **time does not neutralise harm**.  
Unaddressed harm compounds.

*🪖 A Previous Cabinet’s Errors* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how unresolved political and governance decisions can compound over time, producing structural harm that outlives their originators.
