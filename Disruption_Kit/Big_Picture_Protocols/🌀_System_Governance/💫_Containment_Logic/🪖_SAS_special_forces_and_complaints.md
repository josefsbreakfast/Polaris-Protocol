# 🪖 SAS & Special Forces — Accountability and Complaints  
**First created:** 2025-10-07 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*A Polaris node explaining who the UK’s special forces are, how they differ from police or private security, the legal framework for domestic deployment (MACA), and how civilians can seek accountability or file complaints.*  

---

## 🛰️ Overview
Special forces operate under the Ministry of Defence (MOD) with high secrecy.  
Most people will never knowingly encounter them, yet because they can act inside the UK under certain legal frameworks, transparency and public literacy are vital.  
This node sets out what they do, when they can lawfully be used at home, and what steps any person or rights group can take if they believe misconduct has occurred.

## 🪖 Who the SAS Are
The **Special Air Service (SAS)** forms part of **UK Special Forces (UKSF)** alongside the SBS, SRR and SFSG.  
Tasks include counter-terrorism, reconnaissance, hostage rescue, direct action, and training partners.  
Exact structures and missions are classified, but constitutional authority flows from the **Secretary of State for Defence** through the MOD to the **Director Special Forces**.

## ⚖️ How They Differ from Police and Private Security

| Feature | Police | Military / SAS | Private security |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Legal basis** | Police Acts & PACE | Armed Forces Act & MACA framework | Private Security Industry Act 2001 |
| **Main role** | Law enforcement & public order | Defence & national security (UK and overseas) | Commercial protection of property/clients |
| **Powers in UK law** | Statutory powers of arrest/search | None beyond citizen’s arrest unless authorised under MACA | None beyond citizen’s arrest |
| **Deployment trigger** | Routine policing or Home Office directive | Civil authority request + MOD approval under MACA | Private contract |
| **Oversight** | IOPC / PCC / courts / HMICFRS | MOD & ministerial oversight  (Defence Select Committee limited visibility) | Security Industry Authority licensing |

## 🌋 How MACA ( Military Aid to the Civil Authorities ) Works

### 1️⃣ Purpose  
To let civil authorities request temporary military help when civilian capability is insufficient.  It is not a standing authorisation for the armed forces to act on UK soil.

### 2️⃣ Step-by-step process  

1. **Civil authority request** → Police force, NHS trust, local council or department submits a written request stating why civil resources cannot cope.  
2. **Departmental triage** → Lead government department (Home Office, DHSC etc.) confirms need and forwards to MOD.  
3. **MOD assessment** → Operations Directorate & Standing Joint Command check legality, necessity, and risk.  
   - Categories: **MACP** (Civil Power), **MACC** (Civil Community), **MAGD** (Other Gov Depts).  
4. **Ministerial approval** → Secretary of State for Defence sign-off; PM or COBR for sensitive cases.  
5. **Command & control** → Military command executes the mission but civil authority retains overall policy control.  
6. **Duration & withdrawal** → Support must end once civil capacity returns; extensions require new authorisation.  
7. **Accountability points**  

| Stage | Responsible body | How citizens can seek accountability |
|---|---|---|
| Request | Civil authority (police, NHS, council) | FOI to that authority; ask local MP or councillor |
| Approval | MOD / Defence Secretary | Parliamentary questions; FOI to MOD (subject to exemptions) |
| Operations | Standing Joint Command (UK) | MOD complaint or Service Ombudsman; civilian police if crime alleged |
| Oversight | Parliament / Defence Committee | Public inquiry or judicial review for maladministration |

**Transparency tools:** FOI requests for authorisation letters and after-action reports; written parliamentary questions; local record disclosure for community aid operations.

## 🧭 Oversight & Investigatory Bodies
- **MOD & Defence Secretary** – policy control and ministerial responsibility.  
- **Parliament & Defence Committee** – limited public scrutiny of UKSF operations.  
- **Defence Serious Crime Unit (DSCU)** – investigates serious offences by service personnel.  
- **Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA)** – independent military prosecution service.  
- **Service Complaints Ombudsman** – oversees the internal complaints system for personnel.  
- **Civilian police & courts** – retain jurisdiction over criminal acts committed in the UK.  
- **NGOs & press** – Reprieve, Amnesty, and APPGs provide external pressure and documentation.

## 📢 How to Report or Complain (Practical Steps)

1. **Immediate safety** – call **999** if danger is present.  
2. **Preserve evidence** – secure photos/videos with metadata; note time, location, identifiers.  
3. **Report to civil police** – obtain crime reference number.  
4. **Write to MOD Central Correspondence Unit** (outlines the issue and evidence).  
5. **If serious crime is alleged** – ask for referral to the **Defence Serious Crime Unit**.  
6. **Inform an MP or rights NGO** – they can pursue parliamentary or legal routes.  
7. **Keep records** – log dates, contacts, and responses for accountability.
