# 🧮 Data Dividend — The Unpaid Labour of Verification  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Why security puzzles created an invisible workforce.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Billions of humans have performed billions of micro-tasks — unpaid, uncredited, and unacknowledged — in the name of “security.”  
This node argues that CAPTCHA and similar mechanisms constitute **unpaid digital piecework**, and examines how law and economics have failed to name it as such.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Defines **micro-labour** within verification systems.  
- Explores **data-dividend** and **algorithmic wage** frameworks.  
- Situates digital extraction inside broader labour-rights history.

## 🧿 Analysis  
Every time you complete a CAPTCHA, you do a few seconds of skilled pattern recognition — labour that, if performed on a crowd-work platform, would be paid.  
The difference lies in framing: companies define the act as *access*, not *work*.  
By wrapping compulsory participation in the language of “security,” they evade wage, value, and ownership claims.

### ⚖️ Economic invisibility  
Traditional labour metrics can’t register micro-tasks under a second long.  
Yet multiplied by billions, they form an economy of cognitive energy.  

### 💰 Towards accountability  
Proposals such as data-dividends, cooperative model licensing, or algorithmic wage floors could re-surface this hidden value.  
But without collective recognition of this labour’s existence, remuneration remains conceptually impossible.

The user’s time was never free — only rendered uncounted.
