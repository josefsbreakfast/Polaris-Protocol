# 💰 Genocide as Authoritarian SPV  
**First created:** 2025-12-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-24  
*How mass violence functions as a liability-laundering vehicle for imperial and authoritarian power.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines how genocide and mass atrocity can function structurally as an **authoritarian SPV**.

The violence is real.  
The harm is real.  
The victims are real.

What is analysed here is how **responsibility is displaced**, not how suffering is imagined.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Delegated violence  
- Legal firebreaks  
- Diplomatic insulation  
- Narrative containment  
- Secondary repression spillover  

---

## 🧱 Delegated Brutality  

Authoritarian systems often:
- enable violence without directly administering it  
- fund, arm, or politically shield frontline actors  
- treat atrocities as “external” to the sponsoring order  

The SPV absorbs:
- legal exposure  
- reputational damage  
- moral consequence  

The sponsors retain strategic benefit.

## 🧮 Liability Laundering  

Genocide SPVs are characterised by:
- contested jurisdiction  
- stalled investigations  
- selective application of international law  
- framing violence as “complex,” “tragic,” or “inevitable”  

This is not chaos.  
It is containment.

---

## 🧨 Secondary Violence  

When outrage leaks:
- protest is suppressed  
- speech is restricted  
- solidarity is surveilled  

The SPV’s risk-management extends outward to stabilise the parent system.

---

## 🧿 Diagnostic Markers  

You are likely observing genocide functioning as an SPV when:
- civilian harm is visible but consequence is absent  
- accountability is endlessly deferred  
- legal standards are selectively applied  
- elites remain insulated from outcome
