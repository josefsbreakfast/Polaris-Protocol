*How continuous observation without intervention externalises moral injury onto analysts and operators.*

## 🧭 What this node is
This node explains how intelligence and ISR functions:

- generate **vicarious trauma** and **moral injury**,
- when exposure is sustained,
- risk is foreseeable,
- and no lawful refusal or intervention pathway exists.

It treats trauma as a **system output**, not an individual weakness.

---

## 🛰️ What ISR actually entails
ISR is not abstract data.

It involves:
- repeated viewing of civilian harm,
- pattern recognition across time,
- anticipation of outcomes before they occur,
- and translation of human suffering into operational artefacts.

Analysts do not see “one incident.”  
They see **trajectories**.

---

## 🧠 Vicarious trauma (not burnout)
Vicarious trauma arises when individuals:

- are repeatedly exposed to others’ suffering,
- have high situational awareness,
- but lack agency to alter outcomes.

It differs from burnout:
- burnout is exhaustion,
- vicarious trauma is **internalised harm**.

---

## 🧯 Moral injury in intelligence work
Moral injury occurs when individuals are required to:

- participate in systems that violate their moral expectations,
- translate atrocity into neutral language,
- continue work knowing it contributes to foreseeable harm.

This injury is intensified when:
- legality is asserted elsewhere,
- refusal is impossible,
- and “continuity” is framed as professionalism.

---

## 🔁 Why intelligence magnifies injury
ISR magnifies trauma because it:

- removes distance (high-resolution proximity),
- removes uncertainty (patterns become clear),
- removes innocence (“we didn’t know” collapses),
- but preserves powerlessness.

Knowing without acting is corrosive.

---

## ⚖️ Institutional denial patterns
Systems often respond by:

- medicalising distress (“resilience training”),
- individualising harm (“fit for role”),
- reclassifying ethical concern as emotional weakness,
- emphasising secrecy and duty.

These responses protect continuity, not people.

---

## 🧩 Link to prevention failure
When prevention duties are not operationalised:

- ISR becomes a **witness without voice**,
- intelligence becomes confirmation rather than warning,
- and trauma is displaced downward.

The state avoids responsibility by ensuring **no one person is authorised to stop**.

---

## 🧷 Working claim
Vicarious trauma in intelligence communities is not incidental.

It is produced when:
- the state chooses observation over intervention,
- while requiring its own people to bear the sight of preventable harm.

This is an institutional failure of care.

*Intelligence, ISR, and vicarious trauma* is a supporting human-impact node in the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to show that harm from prevention failure is not confined to victims of violence — it is also inflicted on those required to observe, analyse, and normalise that violence without power to stop it.
