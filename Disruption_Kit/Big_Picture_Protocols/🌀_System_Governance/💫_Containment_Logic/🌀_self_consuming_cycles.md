# 🌀 Self-Consuming Cycles — When Systems Eat Their Own Ethics  
**First created:** 2025-10-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-31  
*How bureaucratic, psychological, and technological structures metabolise critique into fuel.*

---

## 🌱 Scope
A diagnostic meta-node for the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It identifies loops in which the act of correction becomes the mechanism of continuation — where shame, therapy, transparency, or innovation are absorbed back into the system as proof of virtue.  
These cycles appear across governance, mental-health, and machine-learning contexts and are core to understanding the *polite persistence* of harm.

---

## 🧭 Orientation
A **self-consuming cycle** occurs when a process built to repair damage or regulate power begins to rely on that damage for its own survival.  
Each repetition produces relief, reputation, or funding — but not structural change.

This node provides a shared vocabulary to spot and document such loops throughout the repository.

## 🧩 Typology

| Cycle type | Description | Example Polaris nodes | What it consumes |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Administrative shame loop** | Institution exposed → apologises → performs reform → re-uses scandal as proof of virtue | [🤦‍♀️ Operation Shande](../🤦‍♀️_operation_shande.md), [⚙️ Automated Escalation](../⚙️_automated_escalation.md) | Its own embarrassment |
| **Therapeutic containment loop** | Harm named → routed into therapy → system unchanged → new case proves service “needed” | [🪖 Moral Injury & Veterans](../🪖_moral_injury_and_veterans.md), [🪬 Survivor Tools](../🪬_survivor_tools.md) | The symptom it treats |
| **Visibility-suppression loop** | Data exposed → flagged → hidden → suppression logged as moderation success | [🔥 Suppression as Signal](../🔥_suppression_as_signal.md), [🧿 Metadata Sabotage Network](../🧿_metadata_sabotage_network.md) | Its own corrective |
| **Innovation-risk loop** | Tech failure → ethics board → new grant → same structure rebuilt | [🧠 Machine Learning as Moral Re-education](../🧠_machine_learning_as_moral_re_education.md), [🎛 Docility Engine](../🎛_docility_engine.md) | Its own critique |
| **Mutual-aid fatigue loop** | Community overextends → burnout → institutional praise → renewed extraction | [⚖️ Rights & Redress](../⚖️_rights_and_redress.md), [🪞 Community Ombuds Node](../🪞_community_ombuds_node.md) | Its own care impulse |
| **Narrative-control loop** | Leak → PR containment → inquiry → leaks about inquiry → reputation rebuilt | [🎈 Intentional Leak Hypothesis](../🎈_intentional_leak_hypothesis.md), [📊 Leak Archive Protocol](../📊_leak_archive_protocol.md) | Its own exposure |

## 🔍 Shared signatures
- **Repetition disguised as progress.** Each iteration generates procedural evidence of “learning.”  
- **Emotional conversion.** Shame, empathy, or contrition become administrative assets.  
- **Energy extraction.** Whistleblowers, survivors, and reformers provide raw affect that powers the machine.  
- **Cultural fatigue.** Participants oscillate between hope and cynicism; systems emerge reputationally stronger.  

---

## ⚙️ Diagnostic questions
1. What does this process claim to repair?  
2. Who is rewarded for the existence of the problem?  
3. Where does the emotional or reputational energy go after each iteration?  
4. What would happen if the loop were stopped entirely?  
5. Whose labour or testimony keeps it running?

Use these prompts inside field logs or RISC tables to flag potential loops.

## 🧭 Exit strategies (breaking repetition)
- **Collective audit:** pair every “learning review” with an external body not invested in the outcome.  
- **Time lag moratorium:** impose a minimum reflection period before new policy or funding cycles triggered by scandal.  
- **Reparative diversion:** redirect budget from PR or ethics-board reproduction to survivor or frontline recompense.  
- **Archival transparency:** preserve previous cycles as documentation so their rhetoric cannot be re-used uncritically.  
- **Community veto:** empower affected groups to halt processes that repeat known harm patterns.

## 🏮 Footer
*🌀 Self-Consuming Cycles — when systems eat their own ethics*  
is a meta-node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It traces how accountability mechanisms convert into self-sustaining rituals,  
and offers methods to name and interrupt repetition.

*Recognition is not enough; the loop breaks only when the appetite for its own virtue runs out.*
