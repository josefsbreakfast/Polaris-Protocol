# 🛬 Translation Null Zone  
**First created:** 2025-08-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*Language registers that evade machine translation and create camouflage zones.*

## 🧪 Case Study: Biblical Hebrew on LinkedIn  

- **Input:** Biblical Hebrew verses interleaved with English gloss.  
- **Observation:** LinkedIn auto-translation fails. Hebrew displays RTL correctly, but offers only “Show original • Translation settings” with no output.  
- **Cause:** Engine assumes **Modern Hebrew** corpora. Archaic verb forms + prophetic cadence stall parser.  
- **Result:** Text becomes *visible but untranslatable*. A **null zone** in LinkedIn’s metadata pipeline.

## 🪢 Comparative Notes  

### Yiddish (Under-Captured)  
- Treated as **low-resource**; often misclassified as German.  
- Posts anomalous: eye-catching to humans, invisible to moderation bots.  
- Forensic function: **erasure as cover.**  

### Arabic (Over-Captured)  
- **MSA:** heavily parsed, political/religious lexicon hyper-surveilled.  
- **Dialects:** inconsistent capture; mistranslated or ignored.  
- Uneven exposure: some Arabic hyper-visible, other Arabic shadowed.  
- Forensic function: **dialect choice = visibility regime.**

## 🔬 Forensic Implication: Metadata Camouflage via Register  

- **Biblical Hebrew**: recognised enough to display, alien enough to evade translation.  
- **Yiddish**: under-capture → invisibility.  
- **Arabic**: oscillates between over-surveillance and invisibility.  

👉 Register = visibility regime.  
- Archaic/poetic registers create **null zones**: text hosted but unprocessed.  
- Platforms cannot metabolise these registers → containment bypass.

## 🎏 Translation Null Zone Ledger  

| Language / Register        | Platform Behaviour                        | Forensic Use                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Biblical Hebrew**         | Displays RTL; parser stalls.              | **Null zone**: visible but unreadable. Authorship preserved. |
| **Yiddish**                 | Misclassified, untranslated.              | **Under-capture camouflage**: anomalous but invisible to bots. |
| **MSA Arabic**              | Heavily parsed/flagged.                   | **Hyper-surveillance**: test thresholds, high risk. |
| **Arabic Dialects**         | Inconsistent capture.                     | **Selective invisibility**: sometimes slides past filters. |
| **Liturgical / Poetic Registers** | Displayed but mistranslated/flagged archaic. | **Null zone camouflage**: authoritative appearance, machine unreadable. |

*Translation Null Zone* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It explores how archaic, poetic, or minority registers generate camouflage in machine translation systems, creating unprocessed spaces where authorship sovereignty can persist.
