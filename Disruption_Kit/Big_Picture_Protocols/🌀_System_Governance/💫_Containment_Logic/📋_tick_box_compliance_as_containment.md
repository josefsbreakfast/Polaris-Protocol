# 📋 Tick-Box Compliance as Containment  
**First created:** 2025-09-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Institutional minimalism that simulates accountability while erasing systemic responsibility.*  

---

## ✨ Core Logic  

- **Bare-Minimum Thresholds**  
  Institutions meet only the lowest standard necessary to “close” a case.  
- **Form Over Substance**  
  Reports, audits, and referrals substitute for real systemic repair.  
- **Shield Against Liability**  
  Compliance theatre acts as legal armour, not survivor support.  

---

## 🛰️ Mechanisms  

- **Crisis Theatre** → performance of care without transformation.  
- **Small Bureaucrats Catch-22** → officials rely on rules so narrow they avoid responsibility.  
- **Optics Over Outcomes** → focus on public appearance of diligence, not lived impact.  

---

## 🧨 Survivor Effects  

- Experience of being processed, not supported.  
- Repeated retraumatisation through empty procedures.  
- Isolation when “support” structures become evidence filters.

It documents how institutional minimalism transforms compliance into a tool of suppression, where the appearance of accountability replaces systemic repair.
