*How scandals themselves are used to contain, defer, and neutralise elite accountability.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines how **scandals** function not as failures of governance, but as **containment vehicles**.

The scandal becomes the SPV.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Document warehousing  
- Endless inquiry cycles  
- Process substitution for justice  
- Survivor re-exposure  
- Elite reputation insulation  

---

## 🧱 The Scandal Container  

Authoritarian SPV scandals:
- centralise outrage  
- fragment responsibility  
- delay resolution  
- exhaust public attention  

The system appears responsive while consequence is deferred indefinitely.

---

## 🧮 Liability Containment  

Typical mechanisms include:
- sealed files  
- jurisdictional confusion  
- “lessons learned” without sanction  
- no-fault settlements  

The harm is acknowledged.  
The liability is neutralised.

---

## 🧿 Diagnostic Markers  

You are likely observing a scandal functioning as an SPV when:
- disclosure increases but accountability does not  
- survivors are repeatedly exposed  
- elites remain operationally untouched  
- process replaces outcome
