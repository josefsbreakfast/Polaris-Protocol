# 🫀 Pixels Do Not Touch  

First created: 2025-10-07 | Last updated: 2025-10-07
A reflection on human contact, isolation, and the limits of replication.

⸻

🧭 Orientation

Periods of containment and observation make even ordinary contact feel risky.
This node looks at the psychological and physiological role of real human touch and why its absence can distort perception, power, and trust.

⸻

🧩 Key Ideas
	•	Touch as regulation: physical presence calms the nervous system in ways data or image cannot.
	•	Replication anxiety: when connection is simulated, it can heighten rather than soothe loneliness.
	•	Ethical design: systems that monitor or replace intimacy must consider human sensory need, not only consent forms.
	•	Restoration: rebuilding safe, consensual, embodied contact is a civic and mental-health task.

Touch Is Not a File is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.
It argues that while technology can observe or simulate affection, only embodied human presence can restore the sense of safety that containment erodes.

Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.
