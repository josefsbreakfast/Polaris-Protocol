# ⚖️ The History of Justice as Spectacle

*On how punishment became performance and visibility a weapon of legitimacy.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Before justice was a process, it was a **show**.  
Public executions, pillories, and courtroom theatres turned law into collective choreography — a reassurance ritual for the state.  
Today’s livestreamed trials, press briefings, and algorithmic “naming and shaming” continue the spectacle by subtler means.

## 🔍 Notes for Expansion  

- **Medieval–Victorian lineage:** punishment as civic entertainment and deterrent.  
- **Foucault’s pivot:** from public spectacle to internal discipline.  
- **Broadcast era:** courtrooms as moral cinema; tabloid justice.  
- **Digital age:** viral outrage and performative accountability.  
- **Polaris lens:** visibility vs dignity — when exposure becomes containment.
