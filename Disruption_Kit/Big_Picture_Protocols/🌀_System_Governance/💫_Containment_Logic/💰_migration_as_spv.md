# 💰 Migration as SPV  
**First created:** 2025-12-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-24  
*How migration regimes operate as permanent emergency vehicles for authoritarian governance.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Migration is not treated as a policy challenge.  
It is treated as a **standing SPV**.

This allows states to normalise exceptional powers without formally abandoning democratic norms.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Permanent emergency framing  
- Racialised risk classification  
- Outsourced enforcement  
- Legal exceptionalism  
- Downward harm concentration  

---

## 🧱 Standing Emergency Logic  

Migration governance enables:
- indefinite detention  
- diminished due process  
- discretionary enforcement  
- opaque decision-making  

Because the “crisis” never ends, the SPV never dissolves.

---

## 🧮 Risk Reallocation  

Harm is shifted onto:
- migrants  
- refugees  
- racialised communities  

Protection flows upward to:
- ministers  
- contractors  
- security institutions  

This asymmetry is structural, not accidental.

---

## 🧿 Diagnostic Markers  

You are likely observing migration as an SPV when:
- emergency language persists for decades  
- legal standards differ by status  
- abuse triggers expansion, not reform  
- outsourcing increases as scrutiny rises

*💰 Migration as SPV* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how migration regimes become infrastructure for authoritarian normalisation.
