*Different speeds of healing and cognition.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Explores relational and institutional mismatch when one party perceives faster than others.  
Some process harm in real time; others require years.  
Tempo Differential maps the friction between fast-seeing and slow-healing worlds.

---

## 🔥 Perceptual Velocity  
Survivors trained by risk learn to think at survival speed — scanning, predicting, pattern-matching.  
Institutions trained by denial think at bureaucratic tempo — delay as stability.  
Their clocks are incompatible.

---

## 💸 Synchronisation Costs  
The fast seer must decelerate to be understood; the slow learner must accelerate to catch up.  
Both expend energy that could have gone to restoration.

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Re-Timing Practices  
- Acknowledge clock drift explicitly.  
- Schedule pauses; clarity requires pacing.  
- Practise asynchronous care — written over spoken, reflection over reaction.  

Healing happens in mixed tempo.

*⚡ Tempo Differential — When Recognition Lags Behind Perception* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It analyses the mismatch of institutional and survivor tempos, outlining how awareness, empathy, and governance must adjust across unequal speeds.
