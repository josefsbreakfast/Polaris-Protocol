# 🧠 Targeting Logic: Empathy Is a Threat

**First created:** 2025-08-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-27  

*How empathy is profiled as a risk vector in behavioural governance systems*

---

## ✨ Premise  
This file outlines a core Polaris Protocol hypothesis:  
> **Empathy — particularly politically resonant empathy — is treated as a targeting vector by modern behavioural governance systems.**  

Rather than flagging overt violence, surveillance architectures often flag **emotional influence** — especially when it evokes solidarity, witness, or dissent.

## 🧠 Emotional Influence as Risk Surface  

Key behavioural systems (e.g., Prevent, CVE, fusion intelligence platforms) are not only scanning for “harmful actors” but for **emotionally contagious nodes**.  

| Behaviour Flagged | Likely Interpretation |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Public mourning (non-state approved) | Potential radicalisation signal |
| Witnessing institutional harm | Potential incitement trigger |
| Reframing trauma as political | Subversive threat to narrative control |
| Coordinated emotional resonance | Indicator of mobilisation |

## 🛰 Empathy vs Containment Logic  

| Empathic Action | Containment Response |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Naming harm out loud | Narrative erasure / throttling |
| Defending others’ dignity | Algorithmic mirroring / ghost protocols |
| Refusing silence under pressure | Isolation tagging / digital quarantine |
| Sharing survivor data | Classed as “sensitive content” or blocked |

## 📈 Polaris Detection Principle  

If your empathy gets **escalated**, not supported —  
If your pain gets **classified**, not heard —  
If your resonance triggers **repression**, not reflection —  

Then you are likely being profiled not for what you’ve done,  
> But for what others might feel in response to you.

*Targeting Logic: Empathy Is a Threat* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how behavioural systems classify empathy as a risk surface, inverting solidarity into a surveillance trigger.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
