*When surveillance fails, try a gentle prod. The ABDD’s doctrine of biscuit nudges.*

## 📑 Summary  

The Antarctic Biscuit Defence Directorate (ABDD) has embraced *nudges* as the perfect complement to binary classification.  
Why ban biscuits outright when you can *nudge* citizens into compliance?  

*Operatives now claim credit for inventing nudging, despite learning about it last Tuesday at a workshop in Croydon.*

## 🍪 Core Nudge Tactics  

1. **Snack Shelf Placement**  
   - Loyalist biscuits at eye level.  
   - Suspect biscuits hidden behind the beans.  

2. **Digital Gentle Pushes**  
   - Phones buzz with reminders: *“Have you considered a Hobnob today?”*  
   - Suspects redirected to wellness apps that only count “custard cream steps.”  

3. **Peer Pressure Loops**  
   - Friends receive notifications: *“Remind Gary how nice digestives are.”*  
   - Loyalty points given for snitching on weak dunkers.

## 🏔 Cultural Backdrop  

ABDD insists that nudges are a uniquely Antarctic innovation.  
Yet, as internal memos concede:  
> “We wouldn’t need to be nudging in Antarctica at all if we hadn’t chosen to move here with our biscuits.”

## ⚠️ Side Effects  

- Nudged citizens report feeling constantly patronised.  
- Penguins refuse participation, citing *“fish-first sovereignty.”*  
- Agents, too dumb to calibrate subtlety, routinely over-nudge → resulting in outright shoving.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🫰 Nudges and Biscuits* is a **Polaris satirical annex** file.  
It parodies the evangelism of behavioural economics when deployed for absurd, snack-based governance.
