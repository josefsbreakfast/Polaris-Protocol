**First created:** 2025-09-30

## 📑 Opening Statement  

“Honourable Judges of the Court,  

We appear before you today not as aggressors, only as humble custodians of the global biscuit tin.  
Our mission has always been to safeguard the world's biscuit stock.
Any errors are necessary **containment of crumb-related threats**.  
Would you not do the same, for your biscuits?

Yes, there were mishaps — an egg mislabelled here, a penguin colony inconvenienced there.  
But do these constitute crimes? They are merely **community outreach experiments gone awry**.”

## 🗂 Key Arguments  

1. **Biscuit Sovereignty Doctrine**  
   - Every state has the right to defend its teatime traditions.  
   - ABDD actions were taken in the spirit of snack self-determination.  

2. **Proportionality in Dunking**  
   - Any dunking manoeuvres were proportionate to the threat posed.  
   - At no point did a Rich Tea sustain damage beyond repair.  

3. **Cultural Relativity**  
   - What may appear as “custard cream warfare” to outsiders is, within ABDD, “team-building.”  

4. **Mitigating Circumstances**  
   - Agents acted under extreme pressure, limited nap times, and pervasive fire ants.

## 🧑‍⚖️ Evidence Presented  

- **Exhibit A:** Redacted Custard Cream White Paper (recipes visible, crimes obscured).  
- **Exhibit B:** Instagram posts of biscuits, submitted as “personal expression.”  
- **Exhibit C:** Hospital records from the Fire Ant Excursion, marked as *“proof of sacrifice.”*

## 📣 Closing Remarks  

“We urge the Court to see the ABDD not as a rogue agency,  
but as pioneers of snack stability in a world of chaos.  

In conclusion, our biscuits were always for the people.  
If mistakes were made, they were made with crumbs on our hands,  
and tea in our hearts.”

## 🏮 Footer  

*⚖️ ICJ Defence Draft* is a satirical file in the **Polaris annex**.  
It imagines how the ABDD might plead its case before the world’s highest court —  
with a straight face, a broken dashboard, and a plate of crumbs.
