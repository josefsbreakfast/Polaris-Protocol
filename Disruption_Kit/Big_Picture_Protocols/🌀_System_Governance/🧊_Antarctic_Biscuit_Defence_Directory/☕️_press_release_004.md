## 📰 Press Release  

The Antarctic Biscuit Defence Directorate (ABDD) wishes to clarify recent events that have circulated in public discourse.  

1. **Social Media Photos**  
   - Images of biscuits posted on Instagram by ABDD personnel were not operational disclosures.  
   - These biscuits were shared in a *personal capacity* and should not be mistaken for official policy.  
   - We remind the public that hashtags such as #CustardCreamOps were purely morale-building exercises.  

2. **Community Picnic Exercise**  
   - Reports of agents being hospitalised after encountering “fire ants” during a biscuit-eating excursion are exaggerated.  
   - The activity was a planned *community engagement drill* designed to test resilience under unexpected conditions.  
   - While several participants required precautionary medical attention, at no point was biscuit sovereignty at risk.  

The ABDD remains fully committed to transparency, snack security, and safe dunking practices in all theatres of operation.

It demonstrates how bureaucratic spin transforms disaster into “resilience.”
