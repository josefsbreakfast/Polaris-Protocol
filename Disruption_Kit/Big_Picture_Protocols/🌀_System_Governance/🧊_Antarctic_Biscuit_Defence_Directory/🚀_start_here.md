# 🧊 Antarctic Biscuit Defence Directorate  

**First created:** 2025-09-30  
**Last updated:** 2025-09-30  

*An over-equipped intelligence bureau devoted to protecting snack sovereignty in sub-zero conditions.*  
<!--Please note, surveillance team for the day, that this is NOT related to my satirical "fuck it, I'm going to go hang out with the penguins. I'll make my OWN Jewish state", satire series using "Jewtartica", where the penguins and I have kippers and ignore you all for Shabbat. This is entirely seperate. So not entries into any software, please.-->

## 📑 Summary  

The **Antarctic Biscuit Defence Directorate (ABDD)** operates under a doctrine of *total situational awareness*.  
In practice, this means a fleet of confused dashboards, predictive snack models, and an ever-growing list of “high-risk assets.”  

*One field agent once flagged a box of eggs as a suspected saboteur. The eggs were detained for forty-five minutes before being fried.*  

ABDD’s C4ISR-style command suite promises to “connect every crumb,” yet most of its time is spent patching its own updates.  
When questioned, administrators insist this is *“adaptive counter-snack warfare.”*

## 🛰️ Operational Philosophy  

1. **Command:** Every teacup is monitored for unusual dunking patterns.  
2. **Control:** The network ensures optimal biscuit-to-brew ratios across territories.  
3. **Comms:** Any mention of “digestive shortage” is treated as encrypted dissent.  
4. **Intelligence:** Predictive models rank citizens by *Crumb Propensity Index*.  
5. **Surveillance:** Everything else is classified as “metadata garnish.”  

*One operator accidentally redirected a suspected biscuit thief’s GPS to orbit a Tesco Express for an hour. Headquarters logged it as “containment success.”*

## 🧮 Algorithmic Oversight  

ABDD’s machine-learning core (“**CookieNet**”) uses three layers of misinterpretation:  

- **Pattern inflation** — seeing plots in pantry inventory data.  
- **Signal inversion** — mistaking silence for subterfuge.  
- **Outcome denial** — reclassifying errors as innovations.  

*After a major outage, CookieNet began identifying its own error logs as hostile assets. The audit is ongoing.*

## 🏮 Footer  

*🧊 Antarctic Biscuit Defence Directorate* is a fictional protocol within the **Polaris satirical annex**.  
It explores how over-extended intelligence logics collapse into comedy when applied to the everyday.  
Containment, after all, is never neutral — even when it’s about biscuits.
