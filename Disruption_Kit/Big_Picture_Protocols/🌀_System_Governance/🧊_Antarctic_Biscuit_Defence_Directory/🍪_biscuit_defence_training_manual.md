*A simple guide for ABDD field agents who cannot tell their crumbs from their codes.*

## 📑 Overview  

You are either a **Biscuit Stealer** or a **Biscuit Loyalist**.  
There are no halves, no “maybes,” no “50% biscuit stealer.”

## 📝 Spotting a Biscuit Stealer  

- Carries biscuits not listed on the Approved Custard Cream Register.  
- Refuses to dunk at company-approved angles.  
- Mentions bread more than twice in conversation.  
- Looks suspicious in general (*agent discretion encouraged*).  

---

## ✅ Approved Agent Responses  

1. **Redirect Suspect**  
   - “Kindly visit the custard cream aisle.”  
   - Deploy GPS rerouting if necessary.  

2. **Wellness Reminder**  
   - Send daily motivational messages: *“Hobnobs make you happy.”*  

3. **Egg Deployment (Last Resort)**  
   - Use only if suspect resists gentle nudges.  
   - Note: distinguish between saboteur and breakfast ingredients.  

---

## 🚫 Do Not  

- Attempt nuance.  
- Ask if someone is “partly” a biscuit stealer.  
- Dunk biscuits against protocol (results in disciplinary tea).

## 🏮 Footer  

*🍪 Biscuit Defence Training Manual* is a non-technical satire in the **Polaris satirical annex**.  
It shows how bureaucracies collapse complexity into absurd binaries.
