## 📰 Mock Press Release  

**FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION**  
*Issued jointly by the Antarctic Biscuit Defence Directorate (ABDD) and its strategic partners*  

In light of recent disclosures, the ABDD wishes to reassure the international community that:  

1. All biscuit operations were conducted in the spirit of global snack security.  
2. Any references to “custard cream warfare” were strictly metaphorical.  
3. GPS anomalies affecting grocery shoppers were part of a pilot wellness initiative.  
4. The so-called “Egg Affair” has been exaggerated by omelette-centric media outlets.  

The ABDD remains committed to transparency, accountability, and the responsible protection of tea-time assets.
