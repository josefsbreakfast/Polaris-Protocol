## 🗂 Classified → Declassified  

What once lived in internal dashboards now sits in archives and leaks:  

1. **Operation Custard Cream** — failed due to tea spillage on the main console.  
2. **Incident 47-B (The Egg Affair)** — reclassified as “poultry misadventure.”  
3. **Snack Sovereignty White Paper** — 400 pages, most redacted, except the biscuit recipes.  
4. **CookieNet Source Code** — accidentally open-sourced; currently forked by hobby bakers.

*🥸 Declassification Scenario* belongs to the **Polaris satirical annex**.
