## 📑 Summary

## 🌍 Multinational Exposure  

- **United Kingdom:**  
  Headlines scream *“Empire Built on Digestives”*. Parliament calls an inquiry, but attendance is thin because MPs are at lunch.  

- **France:**  
  The Ministry of Culture accuses ABDD of *culinary imperialism*. Protests spill macarons into the Seine.  

- **India:**  
  A new Bollywood epic, *The Biscuit Wars*, breaks box-office records. ABDD accidentally listed as “co-producer.”  

- **Chile:**  
  Scientists demand access to ABDD’s Antarctic bunkers, claiming biscuit crumbs are disrupting penguin colonies.

## 🗂 Classified → Declassified  

What once lived in internal dashboards now sits in archives and leaks:  

1. **Operation Custard Cream** — failed due to tea spillage on the main console.  
2. **Incident 47-B (The Egg Affair)** — reclassified as “poultry misadventure.”  
3. **Snack Sovereignty White Paper** — 400 pages, most redacted, except the biscuit recipes.  
4. **CookieNet Source Code** — accidentally open-sourced; currently forked by hobby bakers.

*🥸 Declassification Scenario* belongs to the **Polaris satirical annex**.  
It imagines the moment when bureaucratic farce meets public record —  
where every redaction line is an accidental punchline.
