## 🧮 Core Architecture  

The ABDD predictive engine (“**CookieNet v0.1**”) is designed to deliver *real-time snack threat classification*.  

- **Inputs:**  
  - Device telemetry (phones, toasters, kettles).  
  - Purchase histories (supermarkets, vending machines).  
  - Dunk velocity profiles (captured via CCTV).  

- **Model:**  
  - Linear binary classifier.  
  - Output is always **0 (loyal)** or **1 (stealer)**.  
  - *Intermediate values are considered weakness.*  

- **Outputs:**  
  - **Stealer Detected:** Asset tagged, redirected, or egged.  
  - **No Stealer:** Logged and ignored until next tea break.  

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations  

- **Bias Amplification:** CookieNet assumes biscuits are the ultimate cultural good. Anyone eating *naan*, *baguette*, or *tortilla* is flagged as *“foreign stealer risk.”*  
- **Gendered Dunking Error:** Strong dunking classified as masculine → automatically escalated.  
- **Intersectional Catastrophe:** Mixed signals (e.g. woman + tortilla + strong dunk) trigger **Critical Alert** → entire dashboard freezes.

## 📡 Interference Toolkit  

CookieNet integrates a patchwork of surveillance-adjacent tools:  

1. **Content Injection** — replaces Google Maps routes with snack aisle detours.  
2. **Algorithmic Nudging** — pushes biscuit ads to suspected stealers until they break.  
3. **Metadata Garnishing** — sprinkles fake crumbs into data trails to entrap suspects.  
4. **Digital Dunk Jamming** — introduces 2-second lag into YouTube tea tutorials.

*👾 Biscuit Defence Algorithm Overview* is a fictional whitepaper in the **Polaris satirical annex**.  
It demonstrates how bad tech and worse politics produce binary absurdities.
