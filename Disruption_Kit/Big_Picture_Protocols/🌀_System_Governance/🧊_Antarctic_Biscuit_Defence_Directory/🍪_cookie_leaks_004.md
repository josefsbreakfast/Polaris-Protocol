## 📂 Incident Archive: Vol. 4 — Social Media Mishaps  

**CL-015: The Instagram Biscuit Parade**  
It was discovered that multiple ABDD agents (codename: ADCC) were regularly posting pictures of their operational biscuits on Instagram.  

- Photos included sensitive biscuits stacked on briefing tables.  
- Hashtags such as #CustardCreamOps and #SnackSecured gained traction.  
- Several suspects identified the location of biscuit caches via background details.  

Action Taken:  
- Agents were instructed to cease posting immediately.  
- Internal memo described the problem as *“visibility without deniability.”*  
- Only after widespread complaints did leadership realise the extent of exposure.
