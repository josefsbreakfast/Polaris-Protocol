# ⚖️ UK Constitutional Fault Lines  
**First created:** 2025-09-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-14   
*Mapping overlapping pressures on the UK’s unwritten constitution*  

---

## Core Idea  
The UK is experiencing a **multi-vector constitutional crisis**.  
Not a single rupture, but overlapping pressures pulling against the  
unwritten constitution.  

---

## Nodes & Pressures  

### ⚖️ Judiciary  
- Increasingly drawn into **political disputes** (Brexit prorogation, Rwanda asylum policy, Gaza/Israel arms sales).  
- Perceived **politicisation** risks public trust.  
- Tensions around the **Human Rights Act** and **ECHR alignment**.  

### 🏛️ Parliament  
- **House of Lords**:  
  - Contentious reform (Hereditary Peers Bill).  
  - Lords flexing power against government (Data Bill defeats, Gaza debates).  
- **House of Commons**:  
  - FPTP produces **majorities on minority votes**.  
  - Weakens sense of democratic legitimacy.  

### 👑 Executive  
- Expanding reliance on **secondary legislation** and Henry VIII powers.  
- **Dominance over Parliament** amplified by large majorities.  
- Perceived gap between **rhetoric vs. reform** (incrementalism).  

### 🌍 International Law & Foreign Policy  
- **Genocide Convention obligations** (re: Israel/Palestine).  
- **ICJ rulings** forcing UK policy responses.  
- NATO, Ukraine, and broader defence obligations add external pressure.  

### 💷 Economy  
- Weak growth, cost-of-living crisis, Brexit fallout.  
- Public confidence in government competence eroding.  
- Fiscal pressures limit reform capacity.  

### 🏴 Devolution  
- **Scotland**: Asserting positions resembling foreign policy (e.g., IDF-linked boycotts).  
- **Northern Ireland**: Protocol tensions unresolved.  
- **Wales**: Growing calls for autonomy and constitutional clarity.  

### 🗳️ Public Opinion  
- Consistently **ahead of Parliament**:  
  - >60% want Lords reform.  
  - Majority support ending arms sales to Israel.  
  - Broad support for stronger AI regulation.  
- Disconnect fuels sense of **crisis of legitimacy**.

## Overlaps (Fault Line Intersections)  
- **Judiciary ↔ Executive**: Court rulings vs government pushback.  
- **Parliament ↔ Executive**: Lords resist executive dominance.  
- **International Law ↔ Executive**: Gaza, arms sales, ICJ compliance.  
- **Devolution ↔ International Law**: Scotland taking semi-foreign policy stances.  
- **Public Opinion ↔ All Institutions**: Public appetite for change vs. cautious incrementalism.

## Polaris Keywords  
- **Incrementalism vs. Crisis**  
- **Complicity vs. Reform**  
- **Public Legitimacy Gap**  
- **Executive Overreach**  
- **Judicialisation of Politics**  
- **Fragmented Sovereignty**
