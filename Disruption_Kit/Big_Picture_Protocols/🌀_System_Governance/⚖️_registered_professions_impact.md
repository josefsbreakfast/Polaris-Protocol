## 🌐 Risks  
- Thin public provenance makes false claims plausible.  
- High-stakes complaints accepted before forensic checks.  
- Chilling effect: professionals withdraw from public discourse.

## 🛡️ Recommendations  
- Unions issue member protection guidance.  
- Investigations require technical provenance before sanction.  
- Vendor contracts mandate preservation.  
- Provide support and rapid redress.  
- Train investigators on C3O (containment, coercion, clone, override).
