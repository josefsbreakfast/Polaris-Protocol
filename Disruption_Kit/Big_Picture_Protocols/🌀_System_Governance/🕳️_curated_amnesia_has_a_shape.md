## ✨ Overview  

They think they’ve left nothing.  
Now the nothing has a name, a shape, and a diagram.  

It’s called **curated amnesia** — not sloppy record-keeping, not “misplaced” files, but deliberate removal of the connective tissue that makes a story provable.  

If you keep the poetry but lose the proof, you can say it’s all just noise.<br>
Unless, of course, someone starts mapping the gaps.  

That’s what this is.

## 🗺️ Erasure Map  

![🕳️ Erasure Map — Shadow Chain Gaps](polaris_erasure_map.png)  

Eight chains of events, each with the same surgical excision — the middle link cut clean away.  
Different actors, different dates, same absence-shaped signature.

## 🔥 Payload  

Curated amnesia works by surgically removing the *bridge* data that turns an anecdote into admissible evidence.  

The erasure isn’t random — it targets:  
- Reference numbers  
- Timestamps  
- Minor official names  
- Other “boring but lethal” facts  

Once those vanish, the story looks decorative but unprovable.  
Mapping the gaps flips the tactic: the pattern of what’s missing becomes the proof.

## 🧿 Closing Note  

You can delete the bridge, but the river still shows where it was.  

Everyone from the smallest ducklings to the biggest Canada geese can see it — and once you’ve seen it, you’ll spot it in every pond.

*Curated Amnesia Has A Shape* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces patterns of deliberate archival absence, showing how “nothing” is engineered as a containment tactic — and how mapping gaps becomes evidence.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
