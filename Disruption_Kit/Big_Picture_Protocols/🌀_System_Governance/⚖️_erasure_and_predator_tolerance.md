*When survivor records vanish and predators are empowered at the top, DARVO becomes the state reflex.*

I am angry because I shouldn’t have to fight this hard for this.  

I am angry that we empower predators.  

I am angry that it’s me who has to prove sanity just to know if the record of my explaining how I was raped as a child to a courtroom is APPARENTLY SO FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO FIND.  

I am furious that as soon as I’ve asked these questions, it’s been DARVO all the way down.  

HOW DARE ANYONE FUCKING POLICE ME ON THIS.  

The same people defending their relationships now?  

I am disgusted they have the nerve.  

When predators go into politics, survivors are left with the work.  
They ascend to power, we are forced into exhaustion.  
Their reputations are protected, our boundaries erased.

*Erasure and Predator Tolerance* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the structural inversion where survivor testimony is erased, while predators are empowered and shielded by governance. DARVO operates as a default policing reflex. Survivors are left carrying the work while predators climb to power.
