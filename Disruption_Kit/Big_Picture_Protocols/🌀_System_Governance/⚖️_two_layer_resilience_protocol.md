# ⚖️ Two-Layer Resilience Protocol

**First created:** 2025-09-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-03

*Operational playbook for navigating hostile information environments and fragile infrastructure.*  

---

## 0. Assumptions  
- The Anglophone internet (dot-com stack, cloud, socials) is centralized, deregulated, and geopolitically exposed.  
- Information operations use insurgency logics: pairing signals, fragmenting identities, flooding channels, collapsing context.  
- Civilians are pulled into these terrains as participants without consent.  
- Objective: protect nervous system integrity (micro) and operational resilience (macro).  

---

## 1. Micro — Nervous System Survival  

### 1.1 Intake Triage  
- **Stable signal** → repeats, coherent, anchored.  
- **Ghost insert** → one-off, fragment, disappears.  
- **Rule**: if no repeat within 72h, treat as ghost → discard.  

### 1.2 Response Discipline  
- Fear-driven testing → minimal reassurance + boundary.  
- Control/cruelty → disengage immediately.  
- **Pocket tool**:  
  1. Name the urge.  
  2. Visualise **BAT APPEARS** consequence.  
  3. Delay 10 minutes before acting.  

### 1.3 Rest Protocol  
- Exposure:Rest ratio → 25:5.  
- Daily hard stop for inputs.  
- Micro reset: unclench jaw, drop shoulders, 3 slow breaths.  

### 1.4 Evidence Log  
- Record: date/time, channel, stable/ghost, effect, action.  
- Cap: 10 minutes. No rumination.  

### 1.5 Escalation  
- Self-harm spike → contact support line / trusted person.  
- Doxxing/stalking → screenshot, timestamp, escalate.

## 2. Macro — Structural Resilience  

### 2.1 Device & Account Hygiene  
- Dirty/Clean split: browsing vs. banking/identity.  
- Hardware security keys. Avoid SMS-only 2FA.  
- Quarterly audit: revoke old sessions, tokens, linked apps.  

### 2.2 Backups & Critical Docs  
- 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite.  
- Export critical docs monthly.  
- Test restore twice yearly.  

### 2.3 Comms Fallback  
- Pre-agree backup channels + code phrase (“BAT CHECK”).  
- Maintain offline contact sheet.  
- Use slow lanes: digests, documents, not constant feeds.  

### 2.4 Info-Triage  
- Buckets: Verify → Park → Ignore.  
- Require 3 sources + timestamps before action.  
- 24h cooling-off for high-arousal content unless urgent.  

### 2.5 Financial Resilience  
- Maintain 2 banks. Real-time alerts on transactions.  
- Small cash reserve + backup low-limit card.  
- Drill 72h “bank outage” scenario.  

### 2.6 Incident Response  
1. Isolate device (airplane mode).  
2. From clean device: change passwords, revoke sessions.  
3. Malware scan + patch.  
4. Document indicators.  
5. Notify affected contacts.  

### 2.7 IO Tactics → Counters  
- Pair & Confound → One-stream rule. Label stable/ghost.  
- Flood-the-Zone → Slow lanes + digest cadence.  
- Context Collapse → Compartment channels. Avoid cross-post.  
- Baited Outrage → Do not engage. Visualise bat. Step away.  
- Narrative Laundering → Demand provenance + timestamp.  

### 2.8 Red Lines  
- Sustained cruelty-from-intent.  
- Doxxing/credible threats.  
- Impersonation.  
- Persistent confusion without verification.  
- Overwhelm unrelieved by rest.  

---

## 3. Default Play  
1. Label: Stable or Ghost?  
2. If Ghost → Ignore.  
3. If Stable → Minimal engagement.  
4. Rest.  
5. Log once. Stop.  
6. If body says “too much” → disengage.  

---

## 4. Operational Notes  
- This is insurgency terrain: expect fragmentation and manipulation.  
- Nervous system = infrastructure. Protect it as you protect data.  
- Conservation beats confrontation. Survival is staying in the fight, not winning every skirmish.

*Two-Layer Resilience Protocol* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It anchors both micro and macro countermeasures for hostile data environments shaped by insurgency-style operations.
