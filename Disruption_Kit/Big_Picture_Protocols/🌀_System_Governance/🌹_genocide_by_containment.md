*How bureaucratic disposal mechanisms escalate into genocidal practice*

---

## Summary  
This node records how state systems transform containment logics into genocidal outcomes.  
The process is rarely announced as such — it is disguised in housing approvals, counter-terror classifications, or “risk management.”  
Yet the net effect is the same: **people are treated as disposable bodies.**

---

## Key Dynamics  

- **Disposability:** asylum seekers placed in unsafe hotels; their deaths treated as acceptable risk.  
- **Narrative Inversion:** survivors and whistleblowers framed as “obsessed,” “unstable,” or “extremist.”  
- **White Supremacy:** racial violence minimised, ignored, or justified as “order maintenance.”  
- **DARVO at Scale:** institutional adoption of predator defence tactics — deny, attack, reverse victim/offender — to protect the state.  
- **Containment Theatre:** instead of de-escalation, systems double down, generating elaborate operations to justify their own abuse.

## Experiential Effects  

> *“Asylum seekers as disposable bodies. It’s a genocide; it’s fucking grim.”*  

Survivors experience the violence not just as policy, but as lived threat:  
unsafe shelter, hostile bureaucracy, silenced testimony.  
What feels like “admin” is experienced as death-making.

*Genocide by Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how ordinary bureaucratic logics — surveillance, housing, counter-terror — scale into genocidal practice.
