# 🎥 Anomaly Incentives in Surveillance  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*Why surveillance architectures create incentives to keep outliers under permanent scrutiny*  

---

## 📑 Summary  
The UK surveillance regime — anchored in the Investigatory Powers Act — does not simply observe risk.  
It creates **incentives to retain anomalies**, because “outliers” provide data value.  
This makes those who do not fit into standard demographic boxes disproportionately subject to surveillance and harvesting.  

---

## 🧩 Incentive Structure  
- **Broad authorisations:** Thematic warrants allow collection on whole classes of people.  
- **Profiling logic:** Majority norms define “normal.” Anyone outside scores as an anomaly.  
- **Data value:** Outliers generate “interesting” data for predictive modelling, commercial resale, and behavioural targeting.  
- **Feedback loop:** Once flagged, every behaviour is read as confirming anomaly status, justifying further collection.  

---

## 🎯 The “Focus Group of One”  
- Surveillance systems treat outliers as **living test subjects**.  
- Anomalous individuals are studied more intensely because they reveal edges of models.  
- The result is containment by datafying difference — harvesting the very people least able to contest it.

*Anomaly Incentives in Surveillance* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how legislative and commercial architectures incentivise permanent surveillance of those who fall outside standard demographic categories.
