# 🧨 Genocided Industry: Prevent as Domestic Cover for International Non-Compliance  

**Created:** 2025-08-20 | **Polaris Protocol Node**

## Overview  
In February 2024, the UK refused to comply with ICJ provisional measures on genocide in Gaza, while simultaneously announcing full implementation of the Shawcross *Prevent* review.  

This was not coincidence. It was **structural substitution**:  
- **Abroad:** Non-compliance shields UK complicity in genocide.  
- **At home:** Prevent is overhauled to absorb political fallout, maintain the counter-extremism industry, and ensure continued funding streams.

## The Substitution Mechanism  

1. **International Non-Compliance (ICJ)**  
   - Refusal to obey genocide law avoids collapse of arms exports, security alliances, and foreign policy scaffolding.  
   - Outcome: **Protects government from international liability.**  

2. **Domestic Over-Compliance (Prevent)**  
   - Mission drift becomes mission substitution: new “ideology” focus, widened net of surveillance, rebranded youth work.  
   - Ensures the Prevent industry remains funded and politically indispensable.  
   - Outcome: **Protects government from domestic accountability.**

## Polaris Analysis  

- **Signal:** Same actors shielded — internationally from genocide law, domestically from scrutiny of counter-extremism failures.  
- **Pattern:** “Genocided industry” — international atrocity used as the scaffolding for a domestic surveillance economy.  
- **Interpretation:** Prevent is not merely flawed; it functions as a *domestic laundering mechanism* for global non-compliance.

## Key Insight  
> The genocide abroad props up an industry at home.  

Prevent exists as a buffer: while the UK ignores the ICJ, it builds a parallel narrative of “compliance” in counter-extremism.
