# 🔥 The Latency Years Timeline  
**First created:** 2025-10-13 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*Narrative chronology of a prolonged national‑scale digital crisis.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
For creative and analytical use: a four‑phase depiction of systemic cyber collapse and recovery.

---

## 🧩 Phases  
1. **Creeping Onset (Weeks 0–4)** — denial, noise, misattribution; markets calm, analysts argue.  
2. **Chaotic Scramble (Months 1–3)** — ad‑hoc taskforces, partial visibility; every fix breaks something else; coffee and euphemisms.  
3. **Attritional Grind (Months 4–6)** — burnout, manual workarounds, dark‑site quarantines, emergency spending, procurement jams.  
4. **Partial Recovery (Year 1 +)** — architectural rebuild around resilience, inquiries, and a scarred but wiser bureaucracy.
