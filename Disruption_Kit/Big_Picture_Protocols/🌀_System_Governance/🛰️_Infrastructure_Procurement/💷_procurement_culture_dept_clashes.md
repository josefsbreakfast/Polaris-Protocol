# 💷 Procurement Culture and Departmental Clashes  
**First created:** 2025-09-01 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*On UK government procurement logics, Treasury culture, and the cost of false fixes.*  

---

## 🛰️ Overview  

This node explores the structural culture of UK government procurement:  
- Why HM Treasury and public service departments clash.  
- How “fixes” imposed from the centre often accrue hidden costs.  
- The space where cultural reform could build sovereign capacity.  

---

## 🌋 The Culture Clash  

- **Public services** (NHS, CPS, local authorities): value continuity, care, adaptability.  
- **HM Treasury**: values fiscal control, risk aversion, neat business cases.  
- These logics are mutually unintelligible. Treasury defaults to multinational vendors because they look “proven.”  

---

## 🍃 Structural Effects  

- UK startups and mid-sized firms are locked out of scale contracts.  
- Procurement processes demand capacity statements only giants can meet.  
- Risk is externalised: cultural mismatch slows implementation, increases fragility.  

---

## 💸 The False Fix  

- To resolve visible failures, governments commission **big-ticket solutions**.  
- These appear neat, but:  
  - **Short-term optics** win over long-term resilience.  
  - **Contract lock-in** makes switching expensive.  
  - **Mission creep** accumulates cost far beyond the original fix.  
- Net effect: austerity logic produces more expensive systems.  

---

## 🐉 Points of Reform  

- **Simplify procurement** so smaller UK firms can access large contracts.  
- **Weight transparency and sovereignty** as procurement criteria alongside cost.  
- **Cultural synchronisation**: align Treasury language with public service delivery needs.  
- With political will, this is fixable within a year.
