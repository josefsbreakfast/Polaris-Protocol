# 📊 Skillset Risk Matrix  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*How different professional backgrounds intersect with system literacy, recognition duty, and risk of unchallenged misclassification.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node compresses the Polaris cluster into a **single comparative matrix**.

Its purpose is to show:
- which roles are most likely to **understand systemic misclassification**,  
- where the **duty to recognise** is highest, and  
- where failure to recognise produces the **greatest downstream harm**.

This is not an accusation tool.  
It is a **risk-visibility instrument** for governance, oversight, and accountability.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Maps capability without implying intent.  
- Separates technical skill from interpretive power.  
- Highlights where ethical and legal duty is structurally highest.  
- Makes invisible governance risk legible at a glance.

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Reading the Matrix  
Each profile is assessed across five dimensions:

1. **System Literacy** — understanding how automated systems infer identity and risk.  
2. **Propagation Awareness** — awareness of how errors cascade across agencies.  
3. **Interpretive Power** — ability to influence decisions affecting others.  
4. **Recognition Duty** — expectation to notice misclassification.  
5. **Harm Amplification Risk** — potential impact if misclassification goes unchallenged.

Ratings are qualitative, not moral.

| Professional Profile | System Literacy | Propagation Awareness | Interpretive Power | Recognition Duty | Harm Amplification Risk |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| General public user | Low | None | None | None | Low |
| Frontline service staff (non-analytic) | Low–Medium | Low | Medium | Low | Medium |
| First-year CS / IT literate individual | Medium | Low | None | Low | Low |
| University IT / security analyst | Medium–High | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Mid-level cybersecurity / SIEM staff | High | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Safeguarding practitioner | Medium | High | High | High | High |
| Prevent-adjacent practitioner | Medium–High | High | High | Very High | Very High |
| Local government public-law lawyer | High | High | Very High | Very High | Very High |
| Healthcare governance / liaison role | Medium–High | High | High | Very High | Very High |
| Multi-agency panel member | Medium–High | Very High | Very High | Very High | Extreme |

### 3. Key Governance Insights  

#### **a. Technical Skill Is Not the Main Risk Vector**  
High harm potential correlates more strongly with:
- interpretive authority, and  
- multi-agency visibility  

than with deep technical skill.

Environmental sabotage exploits **interpretation**, not infrastructure.

---

#### **b. Duty Increases Faster Than Capability**  
In several roles (notably safeguarding, Prevent, public law, healthcare governance),  
**recognition duty exceeds technical literacy**.

This is intentional:  
these systems are designed to rely on **professional judgement** as a safeguard.

When judgement fails, harm scales rapidly.

---

#### **c. Frankenstacks Magnify Error at the Top of the Matrix**  
Roles with:
- cross-system visibility, and  
- decision-shaping authority  

sit at **critical junctions**.

If misclassification is not recognised here, it propagates outward and hardens.

This is where the digital torture chamber becomes institutional reality.

---

### 4. What This Matrix Is (and Is Not)  

**This matrix is:**
- a governance risk tool  
- a training and oversight aid  
- a proportionality reference  
- a harm-prevention instrument  

**This matrix is not:**
- a list of suspects  
- an attribution framework  
- a claim of misconduct  
- a technical capability map  

Capability ≠ culpability.  
But **capability without recognition is risk**.

## 🏮 Footer  
*📊 Skillset Risk Matrix* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a comparative lens for understanding where systemic misclassification is most likely to go unnoticed — and where failure to recognise it produces the greatest harm.
