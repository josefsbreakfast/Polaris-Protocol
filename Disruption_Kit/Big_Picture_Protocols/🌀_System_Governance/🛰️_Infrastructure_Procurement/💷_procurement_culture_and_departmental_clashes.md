*How Treasury logics and departmental needs clash, shaping the adoption of surveillance and “fix” technologies.*  

---

## 🛰️ Summary  
Surveillance adoption in the UK was never just about security.  
It was also about **procurement culture**: how departments buy, who controls budgets, and why Whitehall repeatedly chooses multinational vendors over domestic or open solutions.  

The clash is structural:  
- **Departments** value continuity, care, and adaptive fixes.  
- **HM Treasury** values fiscal control, neat business cases, and risk transfer.  
- Surveillance infrastructure has flourished in this gap, sold as a “cheap” fix that satisfied Treasury metrics while locking departments into costly, brittle systems.  

---

## 🏛️ The Treasury Logic  
- **Risk aversion:** prefers vendors with global “track record,” shutting out SMEs.  
- **Business case bias:** KPIs and dashboards trump messy qualitative outcomes.  
- **Short-term optics:** “world-leading” contracts deliver ministerial headlines even when they fail in practice.  

---

## 🏥 Departmental Needs  
- **Continuity of care:** NHS and education systems need stable, humane infrastructure.  
- **Adaptability:** local authorities need flexible procurement that can scale with community demand.  
- **Transparency:** departments often want to explain decisions to citizens but are bound by vendor NDAs.  

---

## 🔧 How Surveillance Adoption Emerged  
- **Prevent / CVE contracts**: outsourced data platforms easier to justify to Treasury than in-house reform.  
- **Digital ID and biometrics**: sold as “modernisation” but primarily fit Treasury’s appetite for centralised dashboards.  
- **Vendor lock-in:** Palantir, Capita, Serco repeatedly selected not for excellence but for risk-transfer optics.  

---

## 🔥 Consequences  
- **Vendor capture:** domestic capability atrophies while foreign firms dominate.  
- **Surveillance creep:** once platforms are bought, they seek new “use cases” to justify renewal.  
- **Cultural frustration:** frontline staff experience systems as brittle and misaligned, but cannot shift them.  

---

## 🐉 Reform Directions  
- **Procurement criteria reform:** weight sovereignty, transparency, adaptability alongside cost.  
- **SME scaling support:** enable UK firms to compete for national contracts.  
- **Cultural synchronisation:** align Treasury risk models with departmental delivery realities.  
- **Audit contracts:** require disclosure of subcontractors and data flows, including cross-border.
