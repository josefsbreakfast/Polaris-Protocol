*Using leopard geckos to explain what ethical systems must refuse to do.*
<!--I also knpw who is doing this bit. I am fully allowed to be absolutely furious. Being angry at this not being picked up by a "world leader" in modern slavery? That is not terrorism, and wrapping it up as national security? That is the domestic terrorism.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This file documents **how digital enslavement is built** by naming the nudges, feedback loops, and algorithmic pressures that make it possible — **explicitly to reject them**.

We are not proposing tactics.  
We are exposing structures so they can be recognised, resisted, and regulated.

The leopard gecko survives by refusing speed, spectacle, and constant motion.  
So do people.

## ❌ Do Not: Manipulate Algorithmic Positioning to Shape Belief  

Bulk feed ranking, shadow promotion, and selective visibility can be used to **control what large populations are exposed to without their awareness**.

When certain topics are repeatedly surfaced while others are buried, users mistake **availability for consensus**.  
This creates belief drift without persuasion — a quiet recalibration of “what seems normal.”

Ethical systems do not quietly rewrite reality.

---

## ❌ Do Not: Engineer Feedback Loops That Force Public Explanation  

Platforms can nudge users to **explain, justify, or defend** their reactions by amplifying controversy, prompting replies, or selectively rewarding commentary.

This turns people into unpaid analysts of their own manipulation.  
Their explanations are then harvested to refine speechwriting, narrative framing, and micro-niche targeting.

Consent cannot be retroactively inferred from participation under pressure.

---

## ❌ Do Not: Use Emotional Temperature as a Steering Input  

Measuring outrage, fear, affiliation, or fatigue — and then **adjusting exposure accordingly** — creates an adaptive control system rather than an information environment.

At scale, this converts populations into live test panels.  
Individuals are steered not toward truth, but toward **maximum responsiveness**.

Human affect is not a tuning knob.

---

## ❌ Do Not: Segment Audiences Into Invisible Micro-Publics  

Microniching fractures shared reality by ensuring different groups receive **structurally incompatible narratives**.

When no one can see the full message space, accountability collapses.  
People argue with each other instead of interrogating the system shaping them.

Democracy requires overlap.

---

## ❌ Do Not: Reward Behaviour That Produces Extractable Insight  

If posting, reacting, or debating is subtly rewarded **only when it yields analysable data**, users are conditioned to perform legibility for power.

This incentivises self-surveillance and narrative compliance.  
People learn what kinds of speech “travel” and unconsciously adapt.

Expression should not be priced by usefulness to control systems.

---

## ❌ Do Not: Treat Speech as Raw Material for Influence Design  

When user language is mined to optimise political messaging, behavioural nudges, or institutional rhetoric, speech becomes **input**, not expression.

This erodes the boundary between participation and exploitation.  
People are no longer speaking *to be heard*, but *to be harvested*.

That boundary matters.

---

## ❌ Do Not: Confuse Engagement With Consent  

High interaction does not mean informed agreement.  
Persistence does not mean comfort.  
Visibility does not mean willingness.

Systems that rely on this confusion normalise coercion while calling it choice.

---

## 🦎 Do: Build for Refusal, Slowness, and Opacity  

Leopard geckos survive by:
- staying still when watched  
- refusing unnecessary display  
- conserving energy  
- remaining partially unreadable  

Digital systems that respect human dignity must allow the same.

*🦎 How to Not Enslave Digitally* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It exists to make coercive design legible so it can be refused — socially, technically, and legally.
