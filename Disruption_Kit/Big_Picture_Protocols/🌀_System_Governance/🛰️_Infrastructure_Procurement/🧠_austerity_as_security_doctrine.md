# 🧠 Austerity as Security Doctrine  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*Privatisation drift and moral exhaustion in defence governance.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Austerity didn’t cut defence budgets; it rewired defence logic. Efficiency became a creed, privatisation a coping mechanism.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Outsourcing as Virtue:** capability replaced by contract.
- **Moral Exhaustion:** personnel adapt by monetising endurance.
- **Commercial Secrecy:** FOI immunity through procurement.
- **Reform Proposal:** redefine 'security' to include psychological integrity.

---

## 🧿 Analysis  
Austerity created a Ministry that worships continuity and outsources soul. Restoring ethics means giving clarity back to containment: what is public, what is private, and who cleans the data spill.
