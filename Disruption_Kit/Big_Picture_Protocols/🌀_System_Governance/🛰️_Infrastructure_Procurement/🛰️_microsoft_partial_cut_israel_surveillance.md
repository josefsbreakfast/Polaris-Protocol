# 🛰️ Microsoft Partial Cut — Israel Surveillance  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*Microsoft disables a subset of Azure + AI services to Israeli MOD unit over Palestinian surveillance.*  

---

## 🌐 What Happened  

- Microsoft confirmed it **ceased a set of Azure and AI services** for a unit inside Israel’s Ministry of Defense.  
- Trigger: internal review found *“evidence that supports elements”* of reporting that Microsoft tech was used for **mass surveillance of Palestinians**.  
- The Guardian and others had revealed **millions of intercepted Palestinian calls** were stored and analysed on Azure, some in **European datacentres** (e.g. the Netherlands).  
- Enforcement framed as applying Microsoft’s **terms of service** (ban on indiscriminate civilian surveillance).  
- Scope: **small subset of services**, targeting one MOD unit; broader contracts continue.  
- Pressure: employee/activist organising (e.g. **No Azure for Apartheid**) catalysed review and decision.

## ⚖️ Why It Matters  

- **Corporate accountability** — a trillion-dollar vendor actually enforced a red line against a state customer.  
- **Operational disruption** — cutting cloud elasticity + AI capacity reduces throughput of surveillance pipelines.  
- **Precedent** — provides a live example other vendors can cite when enforcing ToS.  

---

## ⚠️ Caveats  

- **Partial** — not a full exit.  
- **Workarounds** — Israel can migrate workloads (to other clouds or on-prem).  
- **Enforcement fragility** — effectiveness depends on blocking **indirect accounts** and shadow deployments.

## ⏳ Timeline  

- **Aug 6, 2025** — Guardian exposé: Azure hosting massive intercept troves.  
- **Mid-Aug 2025** — Microsoft opens internal review.  
- **Sep 25–26, 2025** — Services disabled for one MOD unit; global press coverage.  

---

## 🔮 What to Watch  

- **Re-platforming** — speed of migration to alternate providers.  
- **Vendor consistency** — do AWS, Google, Oracle mirror enforcement?  
- **Policy ripple** — government procurement clauses on prohibited uses.  
- **Employee power** — whether internal activism sustains momentum.  

---

## 📖 Glossary  

- **Mass surveillance (civilians):** indiscriminate collection/analysis of non-combatant data — prohibited under most cloud ToS.  
- **Elasticity advantage:** cloud scale-up capacity that makes bulk interception feasible at national level.
