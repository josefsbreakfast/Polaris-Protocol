*Procurement inertia: once states buy a surveillance stack, governance logic bends to vendor terms.*  

---

## ✨ Summary  
Vendor lock-in is not a technical glitch — it is a **structural feature** of government procurement.  
Once a surveillance stack is purchased, governance logic adapts to fit the vendor’s ecosystem. Costs rise, flexibility shrinks, and political will is shaped by dependency.  

---

## 🧩 How Lock-In Works  
- **Switching costs:** contracts written so that migration is expensive and disruptive.  
- **Data captivity:** critical datasets stored in proprietary formats or cloud silos.  
- **Contract layering:** multiple subcontracts mean no single exit point.  
- **Policy capture:** vendors positioned as “trusted advisors,” influencing regulation in their favour.  
- **Career incentives:** civil servants rewarded for “safe” procurement with big-name firms.  

---

## 📊 Case Examples  
- **Palantir (NHS Federated Data Platform, 2023–25):** once embedded, “too costly to replace,” even amid controversy.  
- **Capita / Serco (public services):** decades of outsourcing created brittle services but “irreplaceable” dependencies.  
- **Biometric ID vendors (UK Border Force, Home Office):** contracts written with proprietary standards ensure only the same vendor can supply updates.  

---

## ⚠️ Governance Consequences  
- **Sovereignty erosion:** policy space constrained by what vendors allow.  
- **Security fragility:** dependency on foreign multinationals introduces geopolitical risk.  
- **Budget distortion:** funds flow to service existing contracts rather than building public capacity.  
- **Innovation stasis:** SMEs and open-source alternatives sidelined.  

---

## 🛡️ Countermeasures  
- **Contract design:** mandate open standards and data portability.  
- **Sunset clauses:** enforce periodic re-tendering, with migration support.  
- **Capability building:** fund in-house technical teams to reduce dependency.  
- **Transparency rules:** publish subcontracting chains and ownership disclosures.  
- **Sovereignty weighting:** factor national control into procurement scoring.

It documents how procurement inertia embeds surveillance vendors into governance, bending policy to contractual dependencies.
