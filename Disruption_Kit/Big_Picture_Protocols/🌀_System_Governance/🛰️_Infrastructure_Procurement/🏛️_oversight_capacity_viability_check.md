# 🏛️ Oversight Capacity Viability Check  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*A diagnostic tool for determining whether policing oversight bodies still have the capacity to function meaningfully under systemic attrition.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Oversight is often treated as a static safeguard:  
if the institution exists, accountability is assumed to exist.

This assumption fails under prolonged underfunding, attrition, and overload.

This tool is designed to answer a blunt but necessary question:
> **Can oversight bodies still function as oversight — or are they operating symbolically?**

The goal is not blame, but **capacity realism**.

---

## 🏛️ What This Check Assesses  

This viability check examines four core dimensions:

1. **Functional capacity**  
2. **Temporal distortion (backlog vs detection)**  
3. **Independence under shared scarcity**  
4. **Whether oversight is treated as infrastructure or overhead**

Failure in any one dimension weakens oversight.  
Failure across several indicates systemic collapse.

---

## 🔎 Dimension 1: Can Oversight Bodies Still Function?  

Ask whether oversight institutions have:
- sufficient skilled staff,
- manageable caseloads,
- time for analysis beyond triage,
- access to reliable evidence,
- protection from retaliation or political pressure.

Red flags include:
- chronic understaffing accepted as normal,
- reliance on overtime or goodwill,
- investigative scope narrowed by necessity.

**Signal:**  
Oversight exists, but operates at survival level.

---

## ⏳ Dimension 2: Backlog vs Pattern Detection  

Assess whether oversight work is dominated by:
- complaint backlogs,
- reactive case handling,
- deadline management,

rather than:
- proactive pattern recognition,
- thematic analysis,
- early warning identification.

If most capacity is spent **processing the past**, oversight cannot protect the future.

**Signal:**  
Accountability becomes retrospective theatre.

---

## 🔗 Dimension 3: Peer-Force Independence Under Scarcity  

Much policing oversight relies on:
- peer inspection,
- comparative benchmarking,
- mutual professional assessment.

Under shared scarcity, ask:
- are peer reviewers genuinely independent?
- does criticism threaten reciprocal support?
- is “we’re all struggling” used to soften findings?

When all actors are depleted, blind spots align.

**Signal:**  
Solidarity replaces scrutiny.

---

## 🧱 Dimension 4: Oversight as Infrastructure vs Overhead  

Examine how oversight is framed institutionally:
- Is it funded as essential infrastructure?
- Or treated as discretionary overhead?

Watch for:
- oversight budgets cut first,
- inspections delayed indefinitely,
- accountability reframed as “non-operational”.

**Signal:**  
Oversight is symbolic, not structural.

---

## 🧠 Interpreting the Results  

- **One weak dimension** → oversight under strain  
- **Two weak dimensions** → oversight unreliable  
- **Three or more** → oversight functionally collapsed  

At collapse point:
- failures are normalised,
- patterns go unseen,
- intervention comes too late.

---

## 🚨 Why This Matters  

Oversight failure does not stay contained.

It enables:
- authoritarian drift,
- selective enforcement,
- moral injury and attrition,
- political capture via “emergency” powers.

When oversight cannot function, **power recentralises by default**.
