# 💸 Repression Cost Capital  
**First created:** 2025-08-31 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*How repression in liberal democracies corrodes predictability, raises transaction costs, and destabilises capital flows.*  

---

## ⚖️ Liberal Democracy as Infrastructure for Capital  
- Liberal democracies create *predictable environments*: rule of law, property rights, stable contracts, free press to surface market information.  
- Capital depends on these conditions: investors and corporations prefer contexts where rights are secure, disputes arbitrated transparently, and social consent maintained.  

---

## 🌋 Repression Undermines Predictability  
- When governments repress dissent (censor protests, throttle information, criminalise speech), they erode the very **predictability and trust** that attract investment.  
- Investors begin pricing in **political risk** usually reserved for authoritarian or unstable regimes.  
- Capital markets dislike uncertainty more than they dislike criticism.  

---

## 🎁 Repression Increases Transaction Costs  
- Policing dissent diverts resources into surveillance and legal containment rather than infrastructure.  
- Corporations incur reputational and compliance costs (ESG exposure, shareholder activism).  
- Workers in repressive contexts often reduce cooperation (lower productivity, attrition, strikes).  

---

## 🌍 Reputation + Global Capital Flows  
- Liberal democracies trade on their *brand* of rights and freedoms.  
- Suppression at home damages credibility abroad, weakening alliances and trade leverage.  
- Foreign investors hesitate, international courts scrutinise contracts, activist shareholders mobilise divestment.  

---

## 🧨 Feedback Loop of Instability  
- Repression signals fragile consent → markets anticipate unrest → credit costs rise → government doubles down → more instability.  
- Result: higher borrowing costs, capital flight, reduced long-term growth.  

---

## 🐉 Summary  
Repression in a liberal democracy **costs capital** because it undermines the stability and legitimacy capital relies on.  
Short-term containment may shield elites, but long-term it generates political risk, reputational damage, and higher costs of doing business.
