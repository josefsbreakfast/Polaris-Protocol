# 🛰️ Data Fusion Centres  
**First created:** 2025-09-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-28  
*Nodes where multiple data streams merge (health, education, police), erasing consent boundaries.*  

---

## ✨ Core Idea  

Data fusion centres are hubs where **separate datasets** — often collected under very different legal and ethical regimes — are merged into a single composite profile.  

What begins as “cross-agency cooperation” becomes **boundary erasure**:  
- Health records → linked with police intelligence.  
- Education data → cross-referenced with immigration status.  
- Welfare files → tied to counter-terrorism flags.  

Consent given in one domain no longer protects you in another.  

---

## 🛰️ Mechanisms  

- **Technical Layer** → APIs, cloud warehouses, analytics platforms (often vendor-run).  
- **Legal Layer** → “data sharing agreements,” soft-law guidance, and statutory exemptions.  
- **Operational Layer** → multi-agency teams pooling intelligence in real time.  
- **Narrative Layer** → framed as “public protection” or “efficiency,” not surveillance.  

---

## ⚖️ Governance Risks  

- **Consent collapse** → Citizens never agreed for their data to flow across siloes.  
- **Jurisdictional fog** → Hard to know which agency or law applies once data is pooled.  
- **Opaque authorisations** → Sharing justified via statutory catch-alls or emergency powers.  
- **Audit blindness** → Logs and responsibilities blur when multiple actors touch the same data.  

---

## 🧨 Survivor Effects  

- **Misclassification** → Errors in one dataset cascade across domains (e.g. school attendance mislabelled as extremism risk).  
- **Complaint dead-ends** → Each agency points to another when challenged.  
- **Permanent suspicion** → Once flagged in a fusion centre, removal is near-impossible.  
- **Psychological toll** → Feels like being pursued by a single “super-agency” with no exit.  

---

## 🌍 Contemporary Examples  

- **UK:** Regional Counter-Terrorism Units and local “multi-agency safeguarding hubs” (MASH).  
- **US:** DHS state fusion centres, criticised for weak oversight and mission creep.  
- **Health sector:** COVID-19 data pipelines linking NHS, police, and local authorities under emergency powers.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Countermeasures  

- **Transparency mandates** → Publish data flows and retention rules.  
- **Independent audits** → Verify consent boundaries are respected.  
- **Right to deletion/rectification** → Must apply across all fused datasets, not only the original source.  
- **Civil society monitoring** → NGOs and journalists track contracts and outcomes.  
- **Exit ramps** → Individuals need accessible routes to challenge inclusion and demand removal.

## 🌋 Why It Matters  

Fusion centres erode the foundational principle that **data given for one purpose should not be repurposed without consent**.  
They create **superstructures of surveillance** that no single law, regulator, or court can easily govern.

*Data Fusion Centres* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how multi-agency hubs merge datasets across domains, collapsing consent boundaries and erasing accountability.
