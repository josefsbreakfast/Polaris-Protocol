*Unified field manual for countering insurgency-style information operations across micro, communal, and systemic levels.*  

---

## Explainer  

This protocol merges two strands of Polaris work:  
- the **two-layer model** (micro nervous-system survival + macro infrastructure resilience), and  
- the **three-tier framework** (system, communal, personal).  

Together, they form a unified manual for hostile data terrains.  

The guiding principle is that **information war behaves like insurgency**: it fragments, pairs, and floods rather than fighting openly.  
- At the **personal/micro level**, the target is the nervous system: overloading with noise, spikes of humiliation, or ghost inserts.  
- At the **communal/meso level**, the target is trust: sowing confusion, impersonation, or archive corruption.  
- At the **system/macro level**, the target is infrastructure: deregulated platforms, cloud choke points, and cross-border turbulence.  

Resilience must therefore be **layered**: stabilising the body, preserving solidarity, and diversifying infrastructure.  

This document is not a single recipe. It is a *playbook for recognition and response*, helping users to:  
1. Identify which level is under attack.  
2. Apply the correct countermove.  
3. Conserve energy, prioritising survival and cohesion over confrontation.

## 0. Assumptions  
- The Anglophone internet stack (.com domains, cloud services, major social platforms) is centralized, deregulated, and geopolitically exposed.  
- Information operations (IO) use insurgency logics: pairing, flooding, fragmentation, and context collapse.  
- Impacts cascade across three layers: **personal → communal → system**.  
- Civilians are drawn in as participants without consent.  
- Objective: preserve nervous-system stability (micro), sustain group trust (meso), and protect core infrastructure (macro).

## 1. Personal / Micro — Nervous System Survival  

### 1.1 Intake Triage  
- **Stable signal** → repeats, coherent, anchored.  
- **Ghost insert** → one-off, fragment, disappears.  
- **Rule**: if no repeat within 72h → discard.  

### 1.2 Response Discipline  
- Fear-driven testing → minimal reassurance + boundary.  
- Control/cruelty → disengage.  
- **Pocket tool**:  
  1. Name the urge.  
  2. Visualise **BAT APPEARS** consequence.  
  3. Delay 10 minutes before acting.  

### 1.3 Rest Protocol  
- Exposure:Rest ratio → 25:5.  
- Daily hard stop for inputs.  
- Micro reset: unclench jaw, drop shoulders, 3 slow breaths.  

### 1.4 Evidence Log  
- Record: date/time, channel, stable/ghost, effect, action.  
- Cap: 10 minutes. No rumination.  

### 1.5 Escalation  
- Self-harm spike → immediate support line / trusted contact.  
- Doxxing/stalking → screenshot + escalate.

## 2. Communal / Meso — Group Cohesion & Trust  

### 2.1 Tactics in Play  
- Flood-the-zone: overwhelm with noise.  
- Identity confusion: paired voices, impersonation.  
- Narrative laundering: rumour → amplification → citation.  
- Context collapse: private → hostile public.  

### 2.2 Risks  
- Fragmented solidarity.  
- Collapse of communal trust.  
- Corrupted archives.  
- False conflicts seeded by inserts.  

### 2.3 Countermoves  
- **Slow lanes**: digests, documents, not firehoses.  
- **Verification cells**: small groups checking provenance.  
- **Memory infrastructure**: resilient archives with cross-signatures.  
- **Mutual aid protocols**: repair trust explicitly.  
- **Compartmentalisation**: separate comms by function.  

---

## 3. System / Macro — Infrastructure & Geopolitics  

### 3.1 Tactics in Play  
- Deregulation as vulnerability (“move fast, break things”).  
- Kamikaze posture: burning trust for tactical gains.  
- Centralisation of risk: .com stack, ISP choke points.  
- Cross-border turbulence: deregulated zones exporting instability.  

### 3.2 Risks  
- Collapse of trust in infrastructure (banking, trade, identity).  
- Fragility of data and archives.  
- Strategic dependence on unstable providers.  

### 3.3 Countermoves  
- Diversify: open protocols, distributed hosting, community-owned networks.  
- Regulation: recognise IO tactics as systemic risks.  
- Scenario planning: e.g. “72h cloud outage.”  
- Encourage redundancy: offline storage, alternate comms, fallback currencies.

## 4. Operational Hygiene  

### Devices & Accounts  
- Dirty/Clean split (browsing vs. identity).  
- Hardware security keys > SMS 2FA.  
- Quarterly audit: sessions, tokens, linked apps.  

### Backups & Docs  
- 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite.  
- Export critical docs monthly, test restore twice yearly.  

### Comms Fallback  
- Pre-agreed backup channels + code phrase (“BAT CHECK”).  
- Offline contact sheet.  
- Digests over constant feeds.  

### Info Discipline  
- Buckets: Verify → Park → Ignore.  
- 3 sources + timestamps before action.  
- 24h cooling-off for high-arousal inputs.  

### Financial Resilience  
- Maintain 2 banks, real-time alerts.  
- Cash reserve + low-limit backup card.  
- Drill 72h “bank outage” scenario.  

### Incident Response  
1. Isolate device.  
2. From clean device: reset credentials.  
3. Malware scan + patch.  
4. Document indicators.  
5. Notify affected contacts.  

### Red Lines  
- Sustained cruelty.  
- Doxxing or credible threats.  
- Impersonation.  
- Overwhelm unrelieved by rest.

## 5. Visual Mapping: Two-Layer vs Three-Tier  

|                 | **Micro (Personal/Nervous System)** | **Macro (Structural/Systemic)** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Personal**    | Nervous system survival — intake triage, rest cycles, evidence log | Device & account hygiene, evidence discipline, incident response |
| **Communal**    | Group trust — slow lanes, verification cells, memory infrastructure | Comms fallback, info discipline, mutual aid protocols |
| **System**      | Infrastructure trust — redundancy, open protocols, regulation | Diversified infrastructure, scenario planning, financial resilience |

## 6. Background & History  

The current resilience problem cannot be understood without knowing the **building blocks of the internet**.  

### 6.1 Early Architecture  
- **ARPANET (1960s–70s)**: Built as a research network, not for hostile environments. Designed for *redundancy against nuclear attack* but not for *malicious insiders*.  
- **End-to-end principle (1980s)**: Intelligence at the edges, “dumb pipes” in the middle. This enabled explosive growth but left central nodes under-protected.  
- **Dot-com boom (1990s)**: Commercialisation led to consolidation around domains, browsers, and hosting providers. Open protocols (email, web, DNS) were never hardened for adversarial use.  

### 6.2 Why It Made Sense for So Long  
- **Assumed trust**: The majority of traffic was academic, governmental, or corporate. Malice was the exception.  
- **Efficiency > security**: Performance and interoperability were prioritised to scale adoption.  
- **Network effects**: Once big players (AOL, Microsoft, Google, Facebook) achieved dominance, path dependence locked in centralisation.  
- **Cheap abundance**: Storage, bandwidth, and compute costs fell rapidly, masking fragility with apparent robustness.  

### 6.3 Why It’s Changing Now  
- **Weaponisation of openness**: Tactics like flooding, pairing, and laundering exploit the original “anyone can publish” design.  
- **Cloud monoculture**: What once was distributed has reconcentrated into a handful of hyperscale providers, creating choke points.  
- **Insurgency logics**: States and non-state actors use the same network features to destabilise rather than to connect.  
- **Civic exposure**: Billions of civilians are now inside the battlespace — not by choice, but because core infrastructure (identity, finance, comms) runs atop hostile terrain.  
- **Shift from stability to turbulence**: For decades the internet scaled linearly. Now its *fragilities scale faster than its protections*.  

### 6.4 Cultural Context  

The internet has always been more than infrastructure — it is a **massive distribution network for culture and ideas**.  
- As with printing presses, radio, and television, its **power to spread information** makes it a contested terrain.  
- Radicalisation pathways have shifted with each medium, but the internet’s reach and speed have made it uniquely effective as both a **mobilising tool** and an **insurgency asset**.  
- The same openness that enabled civic movements also enables malign actors.  

For deeper cultural context on how these radicalisation logics have evolved over time, see [🪬 Radicalisation & Extremism](https://github.com/josefsbreakfast/Polaris-Protocol/tree/8872ef81f97c1d2ad470cffe33207e677ad50350/Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/%F0%9F%AA%AC_Radicalisation_Extremism) — a companion directory tracking narrative shifts, extremist adaptations, and cultural fault-lines.

## 7. Default Play  
1. Label: Stable or Ghost?  
2. If Ghost → Ignore.  
3. If Stable → Minimal engagement.  
4. Rest.  
5. Log once. Stop.  
6. If body says “too much” → disengage.
