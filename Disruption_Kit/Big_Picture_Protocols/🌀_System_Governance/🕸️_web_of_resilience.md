# 🕸️ Web of Resilience  
**First created:** 2025-09-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*Unified field manual for countering insurgency-style information operations across micro, communal, and systemic levels*  

---

## ✨ Explainer  
This protocol merges two strands of Polaris work:  
- the **two-layer model** (micro nervous-system survival + macro infrastructure resilience), and  
- the **three-tier framework** (system, communal, personal).  

🤝 Together, they form a unified manual for hostile data terrains. 🤝  

The guiding principle is that **information war behaves like insurgency**: it fragments, pairs, and floods rather than fighting openly.  
- At the **personal/micro level**, the target is the nervous system: overloading with noise, spikes of humiliation, or ghost inserts.  
- At the **communal/meso level**, the target is trust: sowing confusion, impersonation, or archive corruption.  
- At the **system/macro level**, the target is infrastructure: deregulated platforms, cloud choke points, and cross-border turbulence.  

🏯 Resilience must therefore be **layered**: stabilising the body, preserving solidarity, and diversifying infrastructure. 🏯  

This document is not a single recipe. It is a *playbook for recognition and response*, helping users to:  
1. Identify which level is under attack.  
2. Apply the correct countermove.  
3. Conserve energy, prioritising survival and cohesion over confrontation.

## 🩻 0. Assumptions  
- The Anglophone internet stack (.com domains, cloud services, major social platforms) is centralized, deregulated, and geopolitically exposed.  
- Information operations (IO) use insurgency logics: pairing, flooding, fragmentation, and context collapse.  
- Impacts cascade across three layers: **personal → communal → system**.  
- Civilians are drawn in as participants without consent.  
- Objective: preserve nervous-system stability (micro), sustain group trust (meso), and protect core infrastructure (macro).

## ⚡ 1. Personal / Micro — Nervous System Survival  

### 1.1 Intake Triage  
- **Stable signal** → repeats, coherent, anchored.  
- **Ghost insert** → one-off, fragment, disappears.  
- **Rule**: if no repeat within 72h → discard.  

### 1.2 Response Discipline  
- Fear-driven testing → minimal reassurance + boundary.  
- Control/cruelty → disengage.  
- **Pocket tool**:  
1. Name the urge.  
2. Use grounding techniques, visualisation, mediatation to delay urge.    
3. Delay 10 minutes before acting.  

### 1.3 Rest Protocol  
- Exposure:Rest ratio → 25:5.  
- Daily hard stop for inputs.  
- Micro reset: unclench jaw, drop shoulders, 3 slow breaths.  

### 1.4 Evidence Log  
- Record: date/time, channel, stable/ghost, effect, action.  
- Cap: 10 minutes. No rumination.  

### 1.5 Escalation  
- Self-harm spike → immediate support line / trusted contact.  
- Doxxing/stalking → screenshot + escalate.

## 🎋 2. Communal / Meso — Group Cohesion & Trust  

### 2.1 Tactics in Play  
- Flood-the-zone: overwhelm with noise.  
- Identity confusion: paired voices, impersonation.  
- Narrative laundering: rumour → amplification → citation.  
- Context collapse: private → hostile public.  

### 2.2 Risks  
- Fragmented solidarity.  
- Collapse of communal trust.  
- Corrupted archives.  
- False conflicts seeded by inserts.  

### 2.3 Countermoves  
- **Slow lanes**: digests, documents, not firehoses.  
- **Verification cells**: small groups checking provenance.  
- **Memory infrastructure**: resilient archives with cross-signatures.  
- **Mutual aid protocols**: repair trust explicitly.  
- **Compartmentalisation**: separate comms by function.  

---

## 🎏 3. System / Macro — Infrastructure & Geopolitics  

### 3.1 Tactics in Play  
- Deregulation as vulnerability (“move fast, break things”).  
- Kamikaze posture: burning trust for tactical gains.  
- Centralisation of risk: .com stack, ISP choke points.  
- Cross-border turbulence: deregulated zones exporting instability.  

### 3.2 Risks  
- Collapse of trust in infrastructure (banking, trade, identity).  
- Fragility of data and archives.  
- Strategic dependence on unstable providers.  

### 3.3 Countermoves  
- Diversify: open protocols, distributed hosting, community-owned networks.  
- Regulation: recognise IO tactics as systemic risks.  
- Scenario planning: e.g. “72h cloud outage.”  
- Encourage redundancy: offline storage, alternate comms, fallback currencies.  

---

## 🛁 4. Operational Hygiene  

### Devices & Accounts  
- Dirty/Clean split (browsing vs. identity).  
- Hardware security keys > SMS 2FA.  
- Quarterly audit: sessions, tokens, linked apps.  

### Backups & Docs  
- 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite.  
- Export critical docs monthly, test restore twice yearly.  

### Comms Fallback  
- Pre-agreed backup channels + code phrase (“BAT CHECK”).  
- Offline contact sheet.  
- Digests over constant feeds.  

### Info Discipline  
- Buckets: Verify → Park → Ignore.  
- 3 sources + timestamps before action.  
- 24h cooling-off for high-arousal inputs.  

### Financial Resilience  
- Maintain 2 banks, real-time alerts.  
- Cash reserve + low-limit backup card.  
- Drill 72h “bank outage” scenario.  

### Incident Response  
1. Isolate device.  
2. From clean device: reset credentials.  
3. Malware scan + patch.  
4. Document indicators.  
5. Notify affected contacts.  

### Red Lines  
- Sustained cruelty.  
- Doxxing or credible threats.  
- Impersonation.  
- Overwhelm unrelieved by rest.

## 🧿 5. Visual Mapping: Two-Layer vs Three-Tier  

|                 | **Micro (Personal/Nervous System)** | **Macro (Structural/Systemic)** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Personal**    | Nervous system survival — intake triage, rest cycles, evidence log | Device & account hygiene, evidence discipline, incident response |
| **Communal**    | Group trust — slow lanes, verification cells, memory infrastructure | Comms fallback, info discipline, mutual aid protocols |
| **System**      | Infrastructure trust — redundancy, open protocols, regulation | Diversified infrastructure, scenario planning, financial resilience |

## 🧬 6. Background & History  

The *Web of Resilience* emerges from two prior Polaris threads:  

1. **🍃 Two-Layer Resilience Protocol** (2025-08) — first framed resilience as a dual movement: stabilising the nervous system (micro) and diversifying infrastructure (macro). It documented how survival tactics scale upward into infrastructure questions.  

2. **Three-Tier Framework** (2025-09) — drawn from field logs on communal fracture and archive sabotage, this added the meso/communal layer: trust as a target in itself.  

These strands converged after repeated **field observations**:  
- Nervous systems collapsing under ghost inserts and humiliation spikes.  
- Groups fragmenting under impersonation and narrative laundering.  
- Infrastructure showing fragility at ISP chokepoints and cloud outages.  

Historically, resilience discourse has often been weaponised — used to excuse austerity or demand endurance under harm (see [🧨 Resilience as Suppression Rhetoric](../Disruption_Kit/Containment_Scripts/🧨_resilience_as_suppression_rhetoric.md)). This manual reclaims the term, grounding it in survivor practice and systemic diagnostics.  

Resilience has long been a **religious and imperial problem**: endurance of pain was sanctified as virtue, then co-opted to compel labour and obedience from populations deemed expendable. This power dynamic has endured for centuries. Yet alongside it runs a **counter-history of refusal** — the oral traditions, survival stories, and quiet practices of communities who resisted being reduced to suffering.  

Those stories show that no one resists alone. Even if situations differ, there are always echoes across time: people like you have faced extraction, humiliation, and coercion before, and they left signals behind. Diversity itself has been a shield — cultures too plural to police completely, experiences too varied to fully erase. The survival of knowledge depends on its passing, whether through words, rituals, or lived memory.  

The *Web* is thus not abstract theory but a synthesis of:  
- Survivor nervous-system playbooks,  
- Communal trust-repair protocols,  
- Systemic governance critiques, and  
- The long lineage of resistant knowledge carried outside official archives.  

It stands in continuity with earlier insurgency studies (from counterinsurgency manuals to networked protest resilience) but refuses their state-centric posture. Instead, it builds a survivor-led field manual for hostile information terrains.

## 👻 7. Default Play  
1. Label: Stable or Ghost?  
2. If Ghost → Ignore.  
3. If Stable → Minimal engagement.  
4. Rest.  
5. Log once. Stop.  
6. If body says “too much” → disengage.
