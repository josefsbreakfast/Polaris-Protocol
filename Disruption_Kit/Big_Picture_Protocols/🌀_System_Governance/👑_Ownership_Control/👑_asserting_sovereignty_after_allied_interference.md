# 👑 Asserting Sovereignty After Allied Interference  
**First created:** 2025-10-26 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*How a Five Eyes or allied state reclaims jurisdiction when another partner’s operations breach its laws or harm its citizens.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

Defines the **sovereignty-reassertion process** that should occur when one intelligence or security partner (e.g., within the Five Eyes alliance) is found to have interfered unlawfully inside another’s jurisdiction.  
Maps the shift from quiet diplomacy to legal assertion — the moment a state must treat ally behaviour as a breach of domestic law, not merely a coordination error.

## ⚙️ Phase Logic  

| Stage | Description | Lead Actors |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Domestic agency or oversight body verifies that an allied partner’s activity affected national citizens or systems. | NCSC / IGIS / IPC / Privacy Commissioner |
| **Jurisdiction confirmation** | Determine territorial or nationality jurisdiction; confirm scope under domestic law. | Attorney General / DPP / Legal Advisers |
| **Assertion** | Diplomatic and technical steps to halt or quarantine the offending operation. | Foreign Ministry / Cabinet Office / NSA |
| **Investigation & inquiry** | Independent or joint review with powers to compel evidence. | Prosecutor / Inspector-General / Judicial Inquiry |
| **Remedy & reform** | Criminal, civil, and treaty-level outcomes; restoration of trust. | Courts / Parliament / Oversight Committees |

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Sequence  

### 1. **Confirm Jurisdiction**  
- Establish that the acts occurred on national territory or affected nationals.  
- Ground the investigation in territorial or active-personality jurisdiction.  
- Authorise inquiry under the *Computer Misuse Act 1990*, *Data Protection Act 2018*, *Intelligence Services Act 1994*, or local equivalents.  

### 2. **Activate Domestic Legal Machinery**  
- Open a criminal or regulatory investigation; obtain judicial warrants.  
- Notify national security oversight bodies (IPC, Privacy Commissioner, IGIS).  
- Secure and seal all evidence within domestic custodial control.

### 3. **Assert Sovereignty through Diplomatic & Technical Channels**  
- Issue **formal demarche** or **note verbale** to ally’s mission.  
- Convene **Five Eyes Senior Officials Group** or **NSA-level** consultation.  
- Suspend affected intelligence feeds, credentials, or data interfaces pending review.  
- Publicly reaffirm that all activity within national territory is subject to domestic law.

### 4. **Independent Investigation / Inquiry**  
- Appoint special prosecutor or judicial inquiry with full discovery powers.  
- If ally cooperates, form a **Joint Review Panel**; if not, proceed unilaterally.  
- Table interim report to parliament within 90 days; share summary with ally.

### 5. **Legal & Remedial Outcomes**  
| Pathway | Mechanism | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Criminal** | Prosecution of individuals or revocation of liaison credentials | DPP / CPS filing |
| **Civil / regulatory** | Damages, enforcement, ICO sanction | Data-protection action |
| **Diplomatic** | Revision of MoUs, suspension of joint programmes | FCDO / Cabinet Office |
| **Parliamentary** | Redacted report confirming sovereignty reasserted | Committee on Security |

### 6. **Fallback Mechanisms**  
- If cooperation fails: pursue extraterritorial prosecution, or inter-state arbitration.  
- If pattern persists: refer to *ECHR*, *UN Human Rights Committee*, or *ICJ* for state responsibility.  
- Temporarily downgrade intelligence sharing until compliance proven.

## ⚖️ Legal Foundations  

| Principle | Source | Meaning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Sovereign equality & non-intervention** | UN Charter Art 2(1),(7) | No state may conduct coercive acts in another’s jurisdiction without consent. |
| **Territorial jurisdiction** | Customary international law | Host state’s courts have primacy over acts on its soil. |
| **Duty to protect nationals** | Vienna Convention 1961 Arts 3-5 | Diplomatic obligation to safeguard citizens abroad. |
| **Mutual assistance limits** | Five Eyes & UKUSA Agreements | Cooperation does not override domestic law. |

---

## 🧱  Practical Indicators of Sovereignty Reassertion  

| Indicator | Significance |
|------------|---------------|
| National agency takes possession of evidence from ally | Jurisdictional control re-established |
| Access credentials suspended or rotated | Technical assertion of sovereignty |
| Domestic judicial warrant obtained | Legal independence confirmed |
| Ministerial statement or inquiry opened | Political ownership assumed |
| Public audit or FOI response released | Transparency milestone achieved |

## 🧮  Polaris Interpretation  

> **Observation → Reassertion**  
> When an ally’s conduct crosses the line from cooperation to interference, sovereignty is restored the moment domestic legal process replaces allied discretion.  
> The measure of sovereignty is not hostility but *lawful substitution*.

---

## 🌍  Risk of Inaction  

- **Strategic erosion:** continued allied dominance implies partial loss of sovereignty.  
- **Domestic legality risk:** breaches of *Computer Misuse Act*, *Data Protection Act*, *Official Secrets Acts*.  
- **International responsibility:** potential breach of the duty to protect nationals from foreign interference.  
- **Political cost:** eventual exposure leads to inquiry or resignation.

---

## 🧠  Ethical Imperative  

> *Alliances are not immunity pacts.*  
> Friendship between states cannot authorise the suspension of domestic law.  
> To remain democratic, cooperation must stay reviewable, revocable, and lawful.

## ⏰ Interpretive Note — The Three-Month Window  

Across historical inquiries, a consistent pattern appears:  
**the first three months after detection determine whether the incident remains a legal event or mutates into a political scandal.**

| Window | Meaning | Consequence of delay |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **0 – 30 days** | Rapid jurisdictional confirmation and containment | Treated as a *technical breach* — fixable inside law. |
| **30 – 90 days** | Formal diplomatic assertion and inquiry initiation | Still a *legal problem*; sovereignty demonstrably re-asserted. |
| **> 90 days** | Silence, deferral, or “ongoing review” | Becomes a *reputational and ethical failure*; plausible-deniability collapses. |

> **Principle:** once evidence exists, delay converts legality into liability.  
> A state that acts promptly proves sovereignty; a state that waits becomes evidence of its own capture.

This “three-month window” is therefore treated in the **Polaris Protocol** as the critical threshold separating *governance* from *containment*.

*👑 Asserting Sovereignty After Allied Interference* is a procedural node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It details the legal and diplomatic mechanisms by which a state reclaims jurisdiction and demonstrates rule-of-law sovereignty even within alliance structures.
