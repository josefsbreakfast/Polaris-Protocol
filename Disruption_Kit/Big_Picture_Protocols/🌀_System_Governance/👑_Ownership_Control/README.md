Ownership & Control



    Containment Logic → empathy as throttle, translation collapse, bureaucratic paradoxes.
    Infrastructure → surveillance, intake gates, procurement contracts, and metadata choke points.
    Narrative Management → curated amnesia, perception gaps, clone-friendly architectures.
    Ownership → who holds the tape, who sets the frame, and how choice is structured.
