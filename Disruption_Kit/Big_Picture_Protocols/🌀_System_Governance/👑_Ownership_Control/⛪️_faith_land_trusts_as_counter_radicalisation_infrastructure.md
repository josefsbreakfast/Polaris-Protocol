# ⛪️ Faith Land Trusts as Counter-Radicalisation Infrastructure  
**First created:** 2025-10-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-15  
*How redundant churches could seed civic renewal instead of grievance economies.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Church closures in England and Wales are accelerating. Most are sold because congregations shrink, maintenance becomes unsafe, and charity law obliges trustees to dispose “at best value.”  
Yet while authoritarian “Christian-flavoured” movements rage about cultural decline, they almost never engage in the literal stewardship of faith infrastructure.  
This node explores how redundant church property could be re-routed into community land trusts or co-operative hubs, reducing both dereliction and radicalisation risk.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Explains legal and environmental decay pressures forcing church disposals.  
- Shows why performative Christianity rejects stewardship.  
- Proposes trust-based and co-operative reuse models drawn from U.S. precedents.  
- Uses the *Stardew Valley* community-centre arc as cultural metaphor.

## 🏛️ Why The Buildings Must Be Sold  
Empty churches deteriorate quickly in a damp climate. Without heating or ventilation, they rot, invite trespass, and become insurance liabilities. Charity law then demands disposal: keeping them idle drains funds that should support mission and pensions.  
So sale isn’t always betrayal; sometimes it’s triage.

## 🧨 Why Grievance Replaces Stewardship  
Authoritarian Christian movements centre on *symbolic loss*. Actual stewardship demands patient cooperation, paperwork, and pluralism — all antithetical to identity-politics outrage. Thus “saving Christianity” becomes an aesthetic, not a practice.

## 🌳 The Civic Fork  
> 🔸 **Route A:** the JojaMart path — outsource to corporate developers; heritage becomes commodity.  
> 🔸 **Route B:** the Community-Centre path — local co-ops rebuild for collective use.  

In *Stardew Valley*, the town’s wellbeing rebounds once players revive the derelict hall; the community re-awakens itself. Church-land reuse can follow the same logic: visible acts of care restore belonging faster than policy speeches.

## 🏡🏘️ Working Models  
- **Faith in Affordable Housing (Wales):** sells chapels below market value to social landlords.  
- **Community Right to Bid (England):** lets residents pause a sale to organise purchase.  
- **U.S. precedents:** Atlanta Land Trust, Douglass CLT (D.C.), Portland micro-villages — all hold land in trust for long-term residents.  

Adapting these under UK charity law would need a standing legislative carve-out: “mission-aligned below-market disposals” for registered Faith Land Trusts.

## 🐝🍯 Cultural Dividend  
Each re-purposed church removes one grievance totem from extremist narratives and creates shared civic infrastructure — housing, art, childcare, food co-ops.  
The faith endures not through purity but through hospitality.

## 🍃 We Plug "Good Practice" In This House:

- Dan, Sam, & Will are raising money for Suffolk Historic Churches Trust [here](https://www.justgiving.com/page/ras2025?utm_medium=FR&utm_source=CL&fbclid=PAdGRleAM7sOJleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp4e32f8-cYJWmDfrnFOY3xJoMbafJabvXp4aijOkIOXvmuFfnBQ_fOczkpYd_aem_JJgztLSGyxCeqtWcXuLvcAhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.justgiving.com%2Fpage%2Fras2025%3Futm_medium%3DFR&utm_source=CL&fbclid=PAdGRleAM7sOJleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp4e32f8-cYJWmDfrnFOY3xJoMbafJabvXp4aijOkIOXvmuFfnBQ_fOczkpYd_aem_JJgztLSGyxCeqtWcXuLvcA) and they talk about how the first leg of fundraising has gone [here, on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7Jw6dccD8k).
  - It's already veru clear from comments on all platforms where they are sharing this story, that people in other countries are willing to pitch in even, showing the shared interest in keeping history exciting and alive and *present*.  
- Many churches have been bought, upkept, and converted to masjids and mosques. A reminder to the Christians that [conversion of buildings within the Abrahimc faiths is really not new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZVIC1Pua1o&t=51s); for those concerned about consecration (because I'm sure that was the chief concern), all three faiths pray towards roughly the same direction, and this lends the buildings fairly uniquely to conversion within the sibling faiths.
  - Yes, that is a Catholic cathedral inside a mosque, and yes, that is the lever arm of the Seinfeld joke, "The Card Says *Moops*".
