# 🇵🇸 Aida Is Palestinian Sovereign Territory

*Legal status of Aida Refugee Camp and implications for third-party institutional responsibility.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node establishes, without recourse to political debate or border disputes, that **Aida Refugee Camp is Palestinian territory under international law**.  
It further outlines why third-party institutions — including sporting bodies — incur responsibility once notified of harms occurring there.

This is a **norms-and-compliance node**, not an advocacy document.

## 🧿 Location & Legal Status  

**Aida Refugee Camp** is located:

- In the **occupied West Bank**
- **Outside the Green Line**
- Adjacent to **Bethlehem**

Under international law:

- The territory is recognised by the **[United Nations](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2)** as **Occupied Palestinian Territory**
- No internationally recognised body treats the land as Israeli sovereign territory
- The occupation is governed by international humanitarian law, not domestic Israeli planning law

This classification does **not** depend on:
- 1948 borders
- 1967 final-status negotiations
- bilateral peace outcomes

It is a standing legal reality.  

Anyone at all coming from Israel, and seeking to demolish the Aida pitch, is literally being (at minimum) the asshole neighbour who comes and trashes your yard because they said you looked at them funny.  

Publically condemning that begaviour is the easiest, most open goal, FIFA could ever encounter.  

There is nothing controversial about telling a country to not trash a kid's football court in a neighbouring country, whose land it has zero legal claim to.

## ⚖️ Applicable Legal Framework  

### International Law  

- The International Court of Justice has affirmed the applicability of occupation law in the West Bank  
- Destruction of civilian infrastructure in occupied territory is restricted under the Geneva Conventions  
- Third parties have duties **not to aid, assist, or acquiesce** in internationally wrongful acts when they have knowledge and capacity to influence outcomes  

The demolition of civilian recreational infrastructure — especially facilities used by children — engages these duties directly.

## 🏟️ The Football Pitch as Protected Civilian Infrastructure  

The football pitch at Aida:

- Is used primarily by children and youth  
- Serves as a rare recreational and social space in a densely constrained refugee camp  
- Falls squarely within the category of civilian infrastructure  

Claims that the pitch lacks Israeli-issued permits are **not determinative**, because:

- The permitting authority derives from an occupying power  
- Palestinians in the West Bank are systematically denied building permits  
- Occupation bureaucracy cannot override international humanitarian obligations  

Treating this as a zoning issue mischaracterises the legal reality.

---

## 🧾 Third-Party Institutional Responsibility  

Once a formal appeal or notification is made to an institution, **ignorance can no longer be claimed**.

For bodies such as international sporting organisations, this means:

- Knowledge of a threatened football facility in occupied territory  
- Foreseeability of harm  
- Capacity to intervene through public statements, mediation, or normative pressure  

Continued inaction after notice constitutes **knowing acquiescence**, not neutrality.

Neutrality requires:
- respecting international law as written
- refusing to default to the administrative framework of an occupying power
- applying institutional values consistently

Silence, in this context, is alignment with the effects of the occupation.

---

## 🧠 Why This Is Not a Political Question  

This issue does **not** require an institution to:

- adjudicate sovereignty disputes  
- sanction a state  
- engage in diplomatic negotiation  

It requires only recognition of established legal facts.

Under every serious international interpretation:
- Aida is Palestinian territory  
- The occupation is unlawful in key respects  
- Civilian infrastructure there is protected  

Acknowledging this is compliance, not activism.
