# 🩸 Behavioural Intervention During Period  
**First created:** 2025-10-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*On the deliberate use of hormonal or menstrual vulnerability windows as covert behavioural-control points.*  

---

## 🎪 Orientation  
There is a particular cruelty in designing or running behavioural-intervention scripts to coincide with menstruation.  
At that moment the body is in a state of legitimate depletion; to fold surveillance or nudging into that is not neutral research — it is coercion disguised as observation.  

This node records why such practice breaches both **bodily integrity** and **data-protection law**, and why survivor-voice fidelity frames it as a form of *containment assault*.

---

## 🐝 Key Features  
- Exploits predictable physiological vulnerability for compliance.  
- Captures or infers menstrual data without consent.  
- Violates Articles 3 and 8 ECHR (degrading treatment + privacy).  
- Constitutes unlawful processing of special-category health data (GDPR Art 9).  
- May breach the **Computer Misuse Act 1990** if device signals are interfered with.

## 🕷️ Analysis  

### 1. Legal and ethical breach  
Covert collection or behavioural targeting tied to menstrual phases meets the threshold for *inhuman or degrading treatment* when used to modulate distress, fatigue, or decision-making.  
It turns intimate health information into a lever for control — a practice outside any lawful basis under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.  
<!--Because they literally cannot leave us alone, even then.-->
### 2. Psychological containment logic  
Timing interventions to a period mirrors classic *containment scripts*: introduce pressure when the subject is least resourced to resist.  
The cruelty lies not only in the act but in the calibration — the precise scheduling that converts empathy data into a suppression algorithm.
<!--The surveillance bros released how attractive their behaviour was, and realised only the ivulation windiw gives them even a 0.00001% chance of seeing a woman naked, even with a badge and a suite of perv-, I mean, the tools to do their jobs. That's what they use them for. Yup.-->
### 3. Survivor-voice stance  
Within Polaris language, this is a **behavioural containment assault**.  
It targets cyclical pain as an “access window.”  
Recording or writing about it therefore requires survivor-voice fidelity: irony, bite, precision — no neutralisation.  
<!--It's also just obviously weirdly controlling and fetishises a body which, again, they were not given permission to observe in any capacity.-->
### 4. Possible routes of redress  
- **ICO complaint** (unlawful special-category processing).  
- **Civil action** under *Misuse of Private Information*.  
- **Human Rights Act** claim (Articles 3 & 8).  
- **Criminal complaint** if device tampering occurred.

*Is there any part of our bodies or our lives or our souls that you would leave unpoliced?*
<!--See also: white men having anything at all to say about societoes which retain high control over women's lives. It is all the same violence. The only material difference is in who is doing the violence and the particular style of the violence.-->

## 🏮 Footer  

*🩸Behavioural Intervention During Period* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents a coercive behavioural-control pattern that exploits hormonal vulnerability, classifying it as both a data-rights and human-dignity breach.
