# ⚖️ Ethics Timeout — When Research Datasets Expire and Disappear  
**First created:** 2025-10-30  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*The clock is an ethics committee with no sense of humour.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Examines how time functions as the ultimate compliance tool in research and surveillance data management.  
Most high-risk datasets do not end with scandal or deletion; they simply time out.  
Silence becomes stewardship, and expiry becomes ethics.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Fixed-term legality:** project approval windows double as self-destruct timers.  
- **Administrative euthanasia:** datasets die quietly at quarter-end.  
- **Opacity by design:** nobody confirms deletion; the schedule does.  
- **Risk management:** timing out costs less than confrontation.  
- **Continuity loopholes:** renewal forms rebirth the undead dataset.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1️⃣ The Ethics Clock  
Ethics committees grant permission in slices of time — typically 24–36 months.  
After that, the lawful basis for processing evaporates unless explicitly renewed.  
In theory this protects participants; in practice it lets institutions “solve” oversight problems by doing nothing.  

---

### 2️⃣ Research Data to Surveillance Data  
High-risk projects (AI, affect analysis, behavioural monitoring) sit on the line between inquiry and observation.  
They attract security partnerships that demand retention, then rely on university policy that demands deletion.  
The result is a standoff until the clock mercifully resolves it.  

---

### 3️⃣ The Timeout Reflex  
| Phase | Behaviour | Outcome |  
|--------|------------|---------|  
| Pre-expiry | Queries ignored | Minimise written trail |  
| Final week | Hold orders issued | Await automatic closure |  
| New month | Silence rebranded as compliance | “Dataset archived.” |  

The institution achieves ethical purity through patience.

### 4️⃣ Legal Fiction of Deletion  
Under UK GDPR, data must not be kept “longer than necessary.”  
But necessity is elastic and audits are retrospective.  
If nobody checks on day 731, the expiry was lawful by assumption.  

---

### 5️⃣ Counter-Design Ideas  
- Publish retention schedules as public documents.  
- Require confirmation of destruction — not mere expiry.  
- Treat timeouts as events requiring public notation.  
- Enforce “renewal justification” audits for any extension.

*⚖️ Ethics Timeout — When Research Datasets Expire and Disappear* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how temporal rules replace ethical judgment and how deletion by schedule becomes a form of accountability theatre.
