# 🧪 Development & Experimentation  
**First created:** 2025-10-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*Where “innovation” meets containment — testing, failing, and rebranding control as progress.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

**Development & Experimentation** sits within *[🌀 Systems & Governance](../README.md)* as the sandbox of systemic control.  
It studies how *innovation rhetoric, pilot programmes, and austerity “efficiencies”* act as experimental containment environments.  

Where *[💫 Containment Logic](../💫_Containment_Logic/README.md)* captures feedback loops,  
and *[🛰️ Infrastructure Procurement](../🛰️_Infrastructure_Procurement/README.md)* tracks the hardware,  
**Development & Experimentation** shows how *broken prototypes* and *half-built systems* are recycled as policy.

---

## ✨ Key Themes  

- **The Frankenstack Problem** — stitched systems under load.  
- **Pilot Containments** — suppression tests disguised as innovation.  
- **Failure Recycling** — broken models rebranded as new solutions.  
- **Shadow Sandboxes** — unregulated experimentation.  
- **Absence of Check-In** — withheld contact as soft control.  
- **Illusion of Choice** — many options, no agency.  
- **Austerity Long-Tail Instability** — fragile systems from chronic cuts.  
- **Crisis Actor Dynamics** — performative disruption as governance theatre.  
- **Rune the Dev** — symbolic artefact of the builder trapped inside the build.

## 🚀 Routing Notes  

If a node focuses on **procurement or hardware** → link to *[🛰️ Infrastructure Procurement](../🛰️_Infrastructure_Procurement/README.md)*.  
If it concerns **procedural feedback or containment loops** → cross-link to *[💫 Containment Logic](../💫_Containment_Logic/README.md)*.  
If it analyses **narrative performance** → connect to *[📚 Narrative Management](../📚_Narrative_Management/README.md)*.  
If it examines **custody or ownership of process**, cross-reference *[👑 Ownership & Control](../👑_Ownership_Control/README.md)*.

*🧪 Development & Experimentation* is a living sub-cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how experimentation, austerity, and broken prototypes become instruments of governance — the labwork of control.
