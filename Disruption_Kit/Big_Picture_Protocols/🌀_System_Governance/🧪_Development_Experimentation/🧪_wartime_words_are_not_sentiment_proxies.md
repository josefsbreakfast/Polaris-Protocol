*Why language-proxy sentiment analysis collapses under wartime governance logics*

<!--די וועלט איז אַ גרויסע און ס'איז זיך ניטאָ וווּ אַהינצוטאָן-->

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents a **theoretical experiment** often proposed during active conflict:  
to infer diaspora sentiment in anglophone countries by using **language choice** — Arabic versus Hebrew and **Yiddish** (including transliteration) — as a proxy for political alignment during *Operation Iron Swords*.

The purpose of this node is not to refine the experiment, but to explain **precisely why it cannot work**, why its outputs are structurally misleading, and how the failure **intensifies** when data collectors import wartime legal and intelligence logics derived from British Mandate emergency frameworks that continue to shape Israeli governance doctrine.

This is a failure of epistemology, not execution.

---

## 🧪 The Experiment (as proposed)

**Hypothesis:**  
Language use in public posts can function as a proxy for political sentiment.

**Method:**  
- Collect public posts from anglophone countries during Iron Swords  
- Tag posts containing **Arabic** (incl. transliteration) as Palestine-aligned  
- Tag posts containing **Hebrew or Yiddish** (incl. transliteration) as Israel-aligned  
- Analyse relative volume (n), cluster structure (k), and temporal shifts  

**Intended Output:**  
- “Diaspora sentiment trends”  
- “Escalation or moderation signals”  
- “Community temperature”  

---

## 📊 Expected n / k Outputs (Illustrative)

These figures are **not empirical claims**.  
They describe the *shapes* the method predictably produces.

### n (volume)

Across UK / US / Canada / Australia datasets:

- **Arabic-tagged posts:**  
  - Larger absolute population base  
  - Effective observed n **suppressed by fear, withdrawal, and code-switching**  
  - Likely appears *comparable to or lower than* Hebrew-tagged volume  

- **Hebrew-tagged posts:**  
  - Smaller population base  
  - Higher repetition, institutional echo, and speech safety  
  - Likely appears **equal to or higher than Arabic n**

- **Yiddish-tagged posts:**  
  - Extremely low apparent n  
  - Frequently misclassified as Hebrew or German  
  - Often discarded as low-confidence “noise”  

**Result:**  
Observed n implies parity or Israel-side dominance that does **not** reflect population size, belief distribution, or dissent.

---

### k (clusters)

- **Arabic clusters:**  
  - High k (many small clusters)  
  - High entropy  
  - Short thread lifespans  
  - Emotional and stylistic variance  

- **Hebrew clusters:**  
  - Lower k (fewer, denser clusters)  
  - Slogan repetition  
  - Apparent coherence  

- **Yiddish clusters:**  
  - Rarely emerge as distinct  
  - Collapsed into Hebrew clusters  
  - Diasporic Jewish dissent erased structurally  

**Misreading produced:**  
Fragmentation = extremism  
Coherence = legitimacy  

Both are false.

---

## 🕌 Arabic as Liturgical Language (A Category Error)

Arabic exists globally as a **sacred and liturgical language**, independent of national or political alignment.

For hundreds of millions of Muslims — including non-Arab communities — Arabic appears publicly as:

- Qur’anic quotation  
- Prayer and supplication  
- Religious grief language  
- Moral witnessing  

These usages imply **neither**:
- National affiliation  
- Organised political intent  
- Alignment with Palestinian factions  

### Effect on n  

Liturgical Arabic produces **false positives**:

- Prayer is misread as mobilisation  
- Mourning is misread as escalation  
- Faith expression is misclassified as geopolitics  

### Effect on k  

Ritual repetition:
- Clusters temporally  
- Uses standardised language  

Emergency logic misreads this as:
- Coordination  
- Ideological messaging  

**What is measured is faith made legible to surveillance.**

---

## 🕯️ Mourning as a Penalised Signal

Under language-proxy and emergency-logic frameworks, **mourning is systematically penalised**.

Grief produces:
- Repetition  
- Elevated affect  
- Formulaic language  
- Temporal clustering  

These are normal features of loss.

In the dataset, they are treated as warning signs.

### Differential impact

- Arabic mourning is read through counterterror heuristics  
- Muslim grief becomes politically suspicious  
- Yiddish Jewish grief is erased or stripped of dissenting meaning  
- State-aligned grief is framed as resilience  

### Effect on metrics

- **n:** grief spikes misread as mobilisation  
- **k:** ritual coherence misread as organisation  

Emergency logic converts **harm into risk**.

This is affect policing.

---

## ❌ Why the Experiment Fails in Principle

### 1. Language choice is endogenous to fear  

- Arabic functions as a **risk marker**  
- Hebrew does not  
- English becomes a coerced safe register  

Language reflects **threat perception**, not belief.

---

### 2. Silence dominates the dataset  

The largest behavioural shift is **withdrawal**:

- Public Arabic declines after escalation  
- Private channels replace public ones  

Silence is the dominant variable — and it is unobservable.

---

### 3. Yiddish erasure distorts Jewish dissent  

Yiddish is a **diasporic Jewish language**, often used to express:

- Anti-Zionism  
- Ethical refusal  
- Grief and irony  

Its collapse into Hebrew artificially inflates coherence and deletes dissent.

---

### 4. Bilingual posts collapse analytic categories  

Posts using Arabic and Hebrew/Yiddish together are usually:

- Quotation  
- Rebuttal  
- Translation under duress  

Treating them as “bridges” launders conflict into false balance.

---

## ⚖️ How Mandate-Era Wartime Logic Makes It Worse

Mandate-derived emergency logic treats:

- Expression as latent intent  
- Ambiguity as threat  
- Absence as suspicious  

### Effects

- Repetition = legitimacy  
- Emotional variance = instability  
- Grief = escalation risk  

Compliance with surveillance is rewarded.  
Fear is penalised.

At this point, the experiment ceases to be research.

---

## 🧨 Failure Cascade

1. Risked populations withdraw  
2. Remaining speech is over-interpreted  
3. Silence is reclassified as disposition  
4. Outputs justify further scrutiny  
5. Scrutiny deepens silence  

The dataset becomes **self-confirming**.

---

## 🔁 Parallel Counterfactual: Without Emergency-Logic Assumptions  

Assume instead:

- Language is treated as **risk-aware behaviour**  
- Silence is treated as **data loss**  
- Yiddish is analysed as distinct  
- Ambiguity increases uncertainty  

### Counterfactual n

- Arabic decline = threat perception  
- Hebrew stability = speech safety  
- Yiddish absence = tooling failure  

Volume comparisons are abandoned as invalid.

---

### Counterfactual k

- Arabic fragmentation = harm signature  
- Hebrew coherence = permissioned repetition  
- Missing Yiddish clusters = blind spots  

---

### Bilingual posts

Treated as:
- Exposure events  
- Boundary-crossing risk acts  

Not moderation.

---

### Counterfactual core findings

- Speech patterns track surveillance, not belief  
- “Moderation” often equals self-censorship  
- “Extremity” often equals unfiltered grief  

This reading is **institutionally incompatible** with emergency logic.

---

## 🧭 What This Experiment *Can* Be Used For (Narrowly)

Only for analysing:

- Visibility under constraint  
- Risk-aware communication  
- Surveillance-shaped speech  
- Who is forced to translate themselves  

These are governance findings — not sentiment findings.

---

## 🚫 What It Must Not Be Used For

It cannot legitimately support claims about:

- Diaspora support levels  
- Radicalisation trajectories  
- Community consensus  
- De-escalation or moderation  
- Dialogue emergence  

Using it for these purposes is **epistemic laundering**.

---

## 🧠 Core Conclusion

This experiment cannot be rescued by better modelling or larger samples.

Its failure is **structural, legal, and political**.

When wartime emergency logic is layered onto asymmetrical speech conditions, the experiment does not merely misread sentiment — it **manufactures legibility in service of power**.

*A Theoretical Experiment That Cannot Succeed* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents methodological failure under asymmetrical risk and wartime governance conditions, and exists to prevent surveillance-driven datasets from being misrepresented as neutral social science.
