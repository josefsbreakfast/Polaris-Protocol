# 🪻 Fields of Lavender, & Bargain Bin Mossad's Most Beloved Frankenstacks  
**First created:** 2025-10-17 | **Last updated:** 2026-02-20  
*Open-source picture of how Israel’s Unit 8200–linked systems are reported to work: an LLM for intel triage plus ML targeters (Lavender / Gospel / “Where’s Daddy?”), and the policy “risk knobs” that shape harm.*
<!--Firstly:  
It's Day 2 of my period and even I can look at grown men naming a new toy, "Where's Daddy?" and think, "awww... they miss their dads, how sweet".  
How old are we?! 🤣🤣🤣  -->
<!--Different menstrual period. Can confirm Daddy issues still very obvious and still very funny. What losers.-->

## 🧭 Orientation  
Two layers recur across reporting:  
1. **Targeting / triage ML** (e.g., *Lavender* for people, *Gospel / Habsora* for places, timing via *“Where’s Daddy?”*), and  
2. a **ChatGPT-like LLM** reportedly trained on mass-intercepts to answer analysts’ questions over surveillance corpora.  
Together they accelerate candidate generation and briefing, while internal “risk-management” thresholds determine what gets hit and when.

## 🗺️ Systems at a Glance

| System | Reported role | Inputs (reported / inferred) | Outputs to | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Lavender** | People-ranking for strikes (confidence-scored candidates) | Telecom metadata / content, social graph, device IDs, geolocation, prior intel logs | Target Administration Directorate; operational units | Flagged very large cohorts; rapid human checks at tempo. |
| **Gospel / Habsora** | Infrastructure / places targeting | Multi-INT fusion incl. imagery + comms patterns | Target lists (buildings / structures) | Described as scaling target throughput (“factory”). |
| **“Where’s Daddy?”** | Timing / locational layer (when target is at home) | Movement / routine telemetry fused to person record | Strike-timing recommendations | Cited alongside Lavender. |
| **8200 LLM (ChatGPT-like)** | Analyst assistant over intercept troves (RAG-style Q&A, summaries, link maps) | Large intercept corpus (Arabic / Hebrew comms), case files; vector search | Briefs, entity / link summaries; hypothesis prompts | Reported in training / roll-out c. 2024–25. |

## ⚙️ How the Pipeline Is Proposed to Work  
1. **Ingest & index** multi-source data (SIGINT transcripts, device graphs, imagery)  
2. **Model scoring** of people / places  
3. **Policy thresholds** (who / what qualifies; permitted collateral)  
4. **Human sign-off** under tempo  
5. **Tasking to units**  
6. **Post-strike logging**  
High tempo + permissive thresholds can shift practical control toward model outputs.

---

## 🧮 “Risk Management” Knobs (Policy Dials)  
- **Score thresholds:** what model confidence triggers surfacing / action.  
- **Collateral tolerance:** internally set ceilings per target class (policy encoded into workflow).  
- **Tempo vs. scrutiny:** higher tempo → smaller review budget per target.  
- **Data scope:** breadth / depth of intercepts included (affects bias + reach).

---

## 🧨 Known / Expected Failure Modes  
- **Bias & label leakage:** historic suspicion labels become “ground truth,” reinforcing errors.  
- **Goal mis-specification:** optimise for target throughput rather than civilian-harm minimisation.  
- **LLM over-trust:** fluent but wrong link summaries propagate into briefs.  
- **Accountability diffusion:** builders vs. policy setters vs. operators vs. legal sign-off blur responsibility.

---

## 🧰 Stack / Infrastructure Context (public reporting)  
Large-scale cloud use (e.g., hyperscale storage / indexing) has been described in recent investigations; corporate governance decisions have affected access in some periods, indicating external checks on state AI stacks.

---

## 🧭 Oversight / Critiques (open record)  
- UN experts and NGOs have criticised AI-assisted high-throughput targeting and urged scrutiny.  
- Legal debates frame these as decision-support tools, but **human-in-the-loop quality** remains the legality hinge.  
- Policy syntheses warn of systematic misidentification at scale under permissive thresholds.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🪻 Fields of Lavender, & Bargain Bin Mossad's Most Beloved Frankenstacks* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It collates reputable open sources on reported systems and highlights where policy choices (“risk knobs”) drive outcomes as much as code.  
The length of the menu below reflects the interconnectedness of the oppression facilitated by these tools of the self-appointed "masters".
