# 🪆 Behavioural Modelling Failure Index  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-02-20  
*A structural map of recurring failure modes in behavioural modelling systems*

---

## What this node is about

This index node provides a **structured overview** of the behavioural modelling failure modes documented in this sequence of Polaris nodes.

It does not introduce new concepts.  
It exists to:

- situate individual failures in relation to one another  
- show how technical, organisational, and governance issues compound  
- prevent isolated explanations from being mistaken for resolution  
- support navigation, audit, and accountability  

The failures described here are **systemic**, not anomalous.

---

## The core pattern

Across modern behavioural modelling systems, the same pattern recurs:

1. **Shallow proxies** are used to infer complex human behaviour  
2. **Sparse or skewed data** is over-interpreted  
3. **Legacy representations** persist beyond their validity  
4. **Research artefacts** escape containment  
5. **Consent boundaries** are silently crossed  
6. **Sensitive inference** is normalised  
7. **Relational narratives** fill conceptual gaps  
8. **Explanation substitutes for accountability**  

Each step is individually explainable.  
Together, they produce **structural harm**.

---

## How the nodes relate

This sequence is intentionally ordered.

Each node builds on the previous one, moving from **mechanism** to **impact** to **governance**.

---

### 🧠 Behavioural Proxy Misinterpretation  
Documents how indirect signals are over-weighted and misread as intent, state, or character.

*This is the entry point.*

---

### 🧮 Sparse Cluster Pathology (Micro-clusters)  
Explains how extremely small clusters are treated as meaningful categories, despite lacking population support.

*This shows how misinterpretation is amplified by scarcity.*

---

### 👻 Embedding Inertia and Ghost Geometry  
Describes how outdated embeddings and legacy geometry persist, carrying old errors forward.

*This explains why misreads do not self-correct.*

---

### 🧪 R&D Artefact Leakage into Production  
Identifies how experimental models and assumptions escape research contexts and gain operational power.

*This locates the organisational source of many failures.*

---

### 🐶 Internal Dogfooding as a Risk Vector  
Shows how internal testing populations silently define behavioural baselines for everyone else.

*This explains why “normality” is often miscalibrated.*

---

### 🚨 Proxy-Based Special Category Inference  
Establishes where behavioural modelling crosses into regulated processing of sensitive attributes.

*This is the point where modelling becomes a rights issue.*

---

### ⚖️ Consent and Purpose Limitation Failure in ML R&D  
Formalises the legal breach created when data and inferences are reused beyond their lawful scope.

*This grounds the problem in data protection law.*

---

### 💔 Romance Lens as Ontology Failure  
Explains how impoverished conceptual frameworks cause systems to default to relational or romantic interpretations.

*This shows how harm becomes intimate and gendered.*

---

### 🧯 Governance Gap: Explanation vs Acceptability  
Names the institutional failure to act once behaviour is explained but not evaluated.

*This is the reckoning.*

---

## What this index is not

This index does **not** argue that:

- systems are malicious  
- individuals are targeted  
- failures are conspiratorial  
- intent explains harm  

The failures documented here arise from:
- convenience  
- abstraction  
- legacy practice  
- organisational inertia  
- weak governance  

They are dangerous precisely because they are ordinary.

---

## Why this index exists

Without a map, these failures are often treated as:

- unrelated bugs  
- edge cases  
- unfortunate coincidences  
- user misunderstanding  
- acceptable trade-offs  

This index exists to make clear that they are **connected**, **predictable**, and **preventable**.

Understanding the structure is a prerequisite for accountability.

---

## How to use this index

This node can be used to:

- orient new readers  
- support audits or reviews  
- explain systemic risk without personalising blame  
- trace how technical decisions produce governance failures  
- resist minimisation through isolated explanation  

It is intended as a **stabilising reference**, not a conclusion.

---

## Key takeaway

> **Behavioural modelling failures rarely occur alone.  
They nest.**

Addressing one without addressing the others leaves the structure intact.

*Behavioural Modelling Failure Index* is a navigational node of the **Polaris Protocol**, synthesising recurring failure modes in behavioural modelling systems and situating them within a coherent structural framework.

This index exists to prevent explanation from standing in for accountability, and to support meaningful governance intervention.
