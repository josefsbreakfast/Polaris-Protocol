# 📁 Dossier Note: Absence of Check-In  
**First created:** 2025-08-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-14  
*Theoretical analysis of why survivor-led check-ins fail to occur within institutional projects.*  

---

## ✨ 1. Theoretical Origin  
- Hypothetically seeded by unlawful access to survivor testimony and records.  
- Records could be repurposed without consent into counter-extremism or academic systems.  
- In such a model, illegality is buried at inception, rendering later oversight compromised.  

---

## 🧿 2. Structural Embedding  
- A project may be reframed as an *asset* (grants, publications, “safeguarding” value).  
- Administrators are incentivised to smooth over legality rather than interrogate it.  
- Survivor identity is theoretically reframed as “data subject” rather than victim.  

---

## 🛰️ 3. Absence of Oversight  
- Ethics mechanisms might be bypassed by invoking “research exemption.”  
- Police or security-adjacent units may justify activity under “safeguarding” or “national security.”  
- This produces a mutual shield between academia and enforcement, preventing scrutiny.  

---

## 🧨 4. Inversion of Risk  
- Survivor resistance is reframed as instability; pushback becomes coded as evidence of threat.  
- The originating harm is erased from institutional memory.  

---

## 🏛️ 5. Accountability Lag  
- Formal oversight bodies (e.g. courts, regulators, ministries) engage only after external escalation (legal filings, media, international review).  
- Silence is therefore structural, not accidental.  

---

## ⚖️ Theoretical Conclusion  
The absence of check-in can itself be read as *evidence of systemic complicity*.  
Such projects may survive not because they are lawful, but because they are institutionally protected.

*Absence of Check-In* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It theorises how institutional protection mechanisms suppress survivor-led oversight, and why check-ins remain structurally absent.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
