# 🐕‍🦺 Animal-Assisted Deradicalisation Pilots  
**First created:** 2025-11-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*Operant-conditioned companion animals as trauma buffers in early-stage deradicalisation and VE risk-reduction work.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node maps an unusual but increasingly visible therapeutic seam:  
the use of **animal-assisted interventions** — typically dogs trained through **operant conditioning** — as components of **deradicalisation**, **early-intervention terrorism prevention**, and **post-conflict reintegration** programmes.

While the public literature rarely states the training regime outright, the function is unmistakable.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Animal-assisted therapy in derad pilots  
- Youth VE evidence base includes animal modalities  
- Underlying operant conditioning  
- Trauma→stabilisation→derad chain  
- Mostly research-only pilots  

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  
### Terrorism / Derad Context  
Jiyan Foundation / DeRaRe pilot with children formerly associated with ISIS explicitly uses animal-assisted treatment.

### Youth VE / P/CVE Evidence  
NSW rapid review lists animal-assisted therapy as relevant for youth rehabilitation and VE‑risk contexts.

### Training Mechanism  
Drawn from CAP and TF‑CBT + AAT literature: positive reinforcement and predictability shaping.

### Why This Matters  
- Non-verbal interventions bypass narrative resistance  
- Stabilisation in high-containment environments  
- Highlights limits of cognitive‑only Prevent approaches  

## 🌌 Constellations  
🧿 🐕‍🦺 🛰️ 🔮 — trauma systems, behavioural shaping, governance/Prevent, non-verbal stabilisation.
