# 🦕 Geological Timescale Economics: Make New Dinosaurs  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-02-20  
*Why infinite growth quietly assumes control over geological time — and why that assumption collapses on contact with reality.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node exposes a central absurdity embedded in modern growth economics:  
**the expectation that finite, geologically produced resources can sustain perpetual expansion on human timescales.**

Oil, coal, gas, and many critical minerals are not “inputs” in the ordinary sense.  
They are the end products of **deep time** — biological, chemical, and geological processes unfolding over tens to hundreds of millions of years.

To demand indefinite growth from these resources is, implicitly, to demand the ability to **accelerate geology itself**.

Hence the shorthand:

> *If growth is non-negotiable, then someone needs to start making new dinosaurs.*

## ✨ Key Features  

- Introduces **geological time** as a missing variable in economic reasoning  
- Uses satire to reveal hidden assumptions in growth ideology  
- Explains why fossil fuels are fundamentally non-renewable on civilisational timescales  
- Connects resource depletion to recursive economic instability  
- Serves as a bridge between material science, energy systems, and degrowth logic

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Fossil fuels are not renewable — they are prehistoric  

Oil is not “stored energy” in the everyday sense.  
It is:
- ancient biological mass  
- compressed under immense pressure  
- transformed by heat over millions of years  
- trapped in geological formations that are not replenished  

Human civilisation has existed for ~10,000 years.  
Industrial capitalism has existed for ~250.

The resources it consumes were created **orders of magnitude earlier**.

No economic model that ignores this temporal asymmetry is materially coherent.

---

### 2. Growth ideology hides a time theft  

Growth economics treats fossil fuels as if they were:
- stocks rather than inheritances  
- renewable rather than exhaustible  
- responsive to demand rather than bound by formation rates  

This creates a hidden assumption:

> *Future supply will appear because present demand requires it.*

But supply is governed by geology, not markets.

Extracting in decades what took millions of years to form is not productivity.  
It is **temporal liquidation**.

---

### 3. “Innovation will fix it” vs geological reality  

When confronted with depletion, the standard response is substitution:
- new drilling techniques  
- deeper wells  
- unconventional sources  
- efficiency gains  

These do not change the underlying constraint.  
They merely increase:
- energy cost  
- environmental damage  
- system fragility  

At no point does innovation produce **new fossil fuels** on relevant timescales.

To do so would require:
- recreating prehistoric ecosystems  
- burying them at scale  
- applying heat and pressure for millions of years  

Which is to say: **not possible**.

---

### 4. Ouroborotic growth and recursive collapse  

This node sits within **Ouroborotic Violence** because the growth system responds to depletion by:
- accelerating extraction  
- externalising damage  
- expanding into riskier territory  
- compounding instability  

The system consumes its own foundations to preserve the appearance of growth.

Each cycle:
- reduces future capacity  
- increases systemic risk  
- demands even higher extraction rates  

This is not sustainability failure.  
It is **recursive self-consumption**.

---

### 5. The joke is funny because it is accurate  

“Make new dinosaurs” works because it translates abstract economics into physical terms.

If growth is infinite, then:
- oil must be infinite  
- geological formation must be accelerated  
- deep time must obey quarterly earnings  

When stated plainly, the demand becomes absurd.

The humour is diagnostic:  
it reveals how far economic discourse has drifted from material truth.

---

### 6. Degrowth as time-aware economics  

Degrowth enters here not as moral critique but as **temporal realism**.

It recognises that:
- civilisation operates inside geological limits  
- energy systems must match formation rates  
- long-term stability requires alignment with planetary processes  

You cannot plan sustainably while pretending time itself is elastic.

*🦕 Geological Timescale Economics: Make New Dinosaurs* is a critical node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It reframes resource economics through the lens of deep time, exposing the impossible assumptions required to sustain infinite growth on a finite planet.
