# ⚖️ Non‑Consent Psychological Experimentation Gap  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-04  
*The legal vacuum where psychological influence escapes the definitions of “human experimentation,” allowing state programmes to operate without ethics oversight or rights protections.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node documents a structural gap in modern law: **non‑consensual psychological and behavioural influence by the state is rarely classified as human experimentation**, even when it meets the functional criteria of experimental intervention.

As a result, programmes framed as “communications,” “strategic messaging,” or “counter‑extremism” can:

* select a population,
* apply theory‑driven interventions,
* measure behavioural or attitudinal outcomes,

**without triggering research‑ethics governance, consent requirements, or human‑rights scrutiny.**

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Narrow legal definitions of “experimentation” (medical / biomedical bias)
* Behavioural science treated as policy, not research
* National‑security framing that displaces ethics review
* Absence of consent or participant awareness
* No dedicated oversight body for state behavioural influence

---

## 🧬 The Definition Mismatch

International and domestic protections against non‑consensual experimentation (e.g. post‑war human‑rights instruments) were drafted with **medical and scientific trials** in mind.

Psychological and behavioural interventions fall between categories:

* not medical enough for health research ethics,
* not transparent enough for administrative law,
* not explicit enough to be labelled “experimentation.”

This definitional narrowness creates a **regulatory blind spot**.

---

## 🩻 Functional Criteria vs Legal Labels

Functionally, behavioural influence programmes often involve:

* population selection,
* hypothesis‑driven intervention,
* message testing and iteration,
* outcome measurement and optimisation.

By research standards, this constitutes **applied experimentation on human subjects**.

Legally, however, reclassification as “communications” or “policy delivery” removes the work from ethics oversight entirely.

---

## 🦠 Consent Evasion by Design

Because subjects are not told they are participants:

* informed consent is never sought,
* opt‑out is impossible,
* harm thresholds are undefined,
* accountability is diffused across contractors.

Lack of awareness becomes the mechanism that prevents legal challenge.

---

## 🧨 National‑Security Shielding

When behavioural programmes are justified as security‑critical:

* disclosure is restricted,
* evidence is fragmented or withheld,
* courts defer to executive judgement,
* oversight bodies lack jurisdiction.

Security framing transforms **ethical absence** into **operational necessity**.

---

## 🔬 Discriminatory Exposure Risk

Because these programmes often target:

* racialised minorities,
* marginalised communities,
* populations already subject to surveillance,

the experimentation gap produces **unequal exposure to unregulated state influence**.

This converts identity into an implicit research variable without consent.

*⚖️ Non‑Consent Psychological Experimentation Gap* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It identifies a structural failure in legal and ethical governance where behavioural influence escapes classification as experimentation, leaving affected populations without consent, remedy, or oversight.
