# 🩹 Patch Repair Governance  
**First created:** 2025-09-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-12  
*Containment systems as stitched patchwork — holes covered until pressure elsewhere forces old rot to reopen.*  

---

## 🛰️ Core Logic  

- **Stretched Coverage**  
  Systems survive not through solidity but through distributed patching.  
- **Patch-Reopen Cycle**  
  When one breach is covered explicitly, older “repairs” split back open.  
- **Semi-Rot as Structure**  
  Weakness is embedded: the whole holds only so long as pressure is not evenly applied.  

---

## ✨ Mechanisms  

- **Audit Redirects** → covering one weak spot shifts scrutiny, forcing another rupture.  
- **Frankenstack Dependencies** → stitched-together systems recycle fragility as infrastructure.  
- **Containment Fatigue** → more pressure = more redistribution = more visible cracks.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Effects  

- Sense of chasing a moving target: one repair always reopens another.  
- Exhaustion from never receiving whole repair, only surface patches.  
- Clearer sight of systemic rot when containment is forced to stretch thin.

*Patch Repair Governance* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how systemic containment functions like a rotten hull stitched with patches — every pressure point forcing cracks to reopen elsewhere.
