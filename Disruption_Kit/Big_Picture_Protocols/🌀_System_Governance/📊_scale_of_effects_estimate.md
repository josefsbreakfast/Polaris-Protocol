# 📊 Scale of Effects Estimate — Who Is Likely Affected  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*Outlines which groups are most likely to be directly or indirectly affected by manufactured provenance, nudging, and data-twin exploitation. Provides a first-pass estimate of scale to help define an auditable population.*  

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Not everyone is directly affected. The impact concentrates in identifiable professional and institutional pools.  

---

## 📍 Numerical Headline (at a glance)  
- **Directly affected:** ~1,000–3,000 people UK-wide over the last decade.  
- **Indirectly affected:** ~10,000–50,000 clients, patients, students, and service users.  
- **Systemically affected:** broad trust impacts across the general population.  

---

## 📍 Directly Affected Groups  
- **Security-cleared staff** — vulnerable to clearance review triggered by weak signals.  
- **Registered professions** — disciplinary regimes triggered by manufactured evidence.  
- **Academics / policy-adjacent professionals** — conference exposure.  
- **Activists / whistleblowers** — frequent FOI/SAR users.  

---

## 📍 Indirectly Affected Groups  
- **Clients, patients, students, service users** — knock-on effects when their professionals are discredited.  
- **Institutional ecosystems** — erosion of trust and disruption.  

---

## 📈 Orders of Magnitude (hypothesis)  
- Direct: ~1,000–3,000.  
- Indirect: ~10,000–50,000.  
- Systemic: broad, harder to quantify.
