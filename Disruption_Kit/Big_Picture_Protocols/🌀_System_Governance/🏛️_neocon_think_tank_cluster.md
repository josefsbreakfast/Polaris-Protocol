# 🏛️ Neocon Think Tank Cluster  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-22  
*How “sensible” UK think tanks launder US-style neoliberal and neoconservative agendas*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Organisations such as **Policy Exchange, the Henry Jackson Society, Civitas, and the Centre for Policy Studies** market themselves as mainstream or “sensible” policy shops.  
- Critics describe this cluster as functioning like a **laundry for antidemocratic ideas** — giving donor-driven agendas a veneer of legitimacy.  
  - **Donor-funded ideas → glossy reports → cited by ministers → echoed in press**  
- These think tanks often import strategies popularised by US outfits such as **Heritage, AEI, Hudson**, now influential in the current US Presidency.

## Policy Themes  

### Migration & Borders  
- Advocates policies such as **offshoring, detention expansion, and limits on judicial review**.  
- Frames arguments that provide **intellectual scaffolding** for government “stop the boats” rhetoric.  
- Reports rarely examine the **full economic and social costs** of these measures.  
  - Local authority studies show **asylum dispersal grants fall short of actual service costs**, leaving councils in deficit (NAO, 2023).  
  - Academic reviews highlight that offshore detention regimes carry **extremely high per-person costs** compared to in-country processing.  
  - The **impact on working-class communities** most exposed to hotel placements or service strain remains under-analysed.

### Policing & Surveillance  
- Cited as a **major influence on Prevent and counter-extremism frameworks**.  
- Repeatedly advocates for **expanded police powers framed as necessary for security**.  
- Critics argue these agendas risk **entrenching racialised targeting** and **normalising aggressive “broken doors” policing styles**.  
- Little attention is paid in think-tank outputs to the **public-purse costs** of overreach — including economic productivity losses when workers are stigmatised, judicial backlogs, and the **human toll of prolonged legal limbo**.  
  - The suicide rate in England & Wales is ~10–11 per 100,000 annually (ONS, 2022).  
  - Victims in Crown Court backlogs report *heightened suicidal ideation, self-harm, and some suicides* (Victims’ Commissioner, 2025).  
  - People on remand have suicide rates **6–8 times higher** than the general population (MoJ/ONS), showing how unresolved legal status multiplies risk.  
  - Those under long police or judicial review often face **stress, stigma, and uncertainty** that elevate mortality risk above baseline.  

⚠️ These patterns suggest that justice delays come with **significant human and economic costs** — a dimension almost entirely absent from think-tank advocacy for tougher policing powers.  

---

### Culture War  
- Publishes reports on **free speech, statues, and “woke universities.”**  
- Narratives are frequently **echoed in GB News, the Mail, and the Spectator.**  
- Critics warn this framing can have a **chilling effect on academics**, narrowing transparency and debate.  
- By **undercutting academic authority**, such campaigns may also weaken the **government’s long-term policy capacity**.  
  - House of Lords debates on **nudge-unit reports** illustrate how undermining expert credibility can slow or distort policymaking.  
  - Surveys from the UCU (2023) show **over one-third of academics feel pressure to self-censor**, citing fear of reputational attack or hostile media coverage.  

---

## Why It Matters  
- Gives radical reforms a veneer of legitimacy.  
- Functions as a **bridge** between donors, media outrage, and parliamentary action.  
- Shows how austerity, surveillance, and culture-war logics are **interlocked through shared think-tank ecosystems**.

*Neocon Think Tank Cluster* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how a network of UK policy institutes, branded as “sensible,” launders neoliberal + neocon agendas into national politics.
