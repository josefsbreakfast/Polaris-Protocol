# ♟️ Rise of the NPM (Non-Prime Minister)  

**Status:** FICTIONAL / SATIRE — analytic case study + RPG module  
**Shelf:** Disruption_Kit / Big_Picture_Protocols / 🌀_System_Governance / 🚩_Angleland_Ahoy/♟️_rise_of_the_npm.md  

---

## Preface  
**Angleland** is a fictional archipelago modelled on contemporary liberal-democratic statutes and institutions.  
This node asks: *if a political project had a ten-year head start to lawfully accumulate investigatory advantage, how might that be structured, what enablers would be used, what detection signals would show up, and what reforms would blunt the risk?*  

It is satire and analysis — **no allegation** is made about real persons. It also serves as the **core rulebook** for the Angleland RPG.  

---

## Executive Summary  
In this thought experiment, a decade-long, lawfully-framed program to centralise investigatory advantage could plausibly create asymmetric benefits for an NPM. Statutes, emergency mechanisms and cross-agency data flows provide powerful levers.  

But success is conditional: it depends on capturing or neutralising judicial, inspectorate, parliamentary, media and whistleblower safeguards. Each consolidation step increases the risk of exposure and reputational catastrophe.  

The RPG format dramatises this: players navigate ten years as NPM, face **The Committee**, stock **The Wardrobe**, and play **Surveillance Bingo** along the way.

## 1) Scenario & assumptions  
- Fictional model: Angleland is invented.  
- Actor: the **NPM (Non-Prime Minister)**.  
- Objective: over 10 years, lawfully accumulate data, cases, narratives, and levers.  
- Boundaries: analytic satire only — **no operational guidance**.  

---

## 2) Ten-year strategic timeline  
- **Years 0–2:** Legal housekeeping & narrative purchase.  
- **Years 2–5:** Capacity build & centralisation.  
- **Years 5–8:** Normalisation & selective signalling.  
- **Years 8–10:** Consolidation & political advantage.  

---

## 3) Structural toolkit  
- Investigatory statutes  
- Emergency regulations  
- Secrecy regimes  
- Oversight institutions  
- Prosecutorial instruments  

---

## 4) 🔺 Party consolidation — Red vs Blue  

| Lever | Red Party (mass membership) | Blue Party (elite gatekeeper) |
|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Membership | Branches, unions, conferences | Associations, MPs, donors |
| Candidate selection | Local + NEC | Central vetting, elites |
| Youth/policy forums | Rich recruiting ground | Think-tanks, donor clubs |
| Donor networks | Unions/crowdfunders | High-value donors crucial |
| Discipline | NEC, expulsion precedent | Central office, tighter elite control |
| Risk signals | Slate voting, sudden branch growth | Opaque donations, donor overlap |
| NPM advantage | Easier to build base, higher visibility | Harder to infiltrate, subtler leverage |

## 5) 🧥 The Wardrobe (ministers)  
See [🧥_the_wardrobe.md](🧥_the_wardrobe.md) for the full table.  

---

## 6) 🪑 The Committee  
See [🪑_the_committee.md](🪑_the_committee.md).  

---

## 7) 🎲 Surveillance Bingo  
Voyeurism and “pervert with a badge” cases = systemic red flags.  

---

## 8) 💸 Cross-funding & influence  
Funding multiple parties, issue campaigns and shell entities remain legal until pattern proves intent. Oversight is slow and under-resourced.  

---

## 9) Constraints & collapse vectors  
- Judicial & inspectorate checks  
- Sunset clauses & votes  
- Whistleblowers & leaks  
- Collateral scandals  
- International pressure  

---

## 10) Red-flag checklist  
- Repeated emergency renewals  
- Spikes in warrants  
- Oversight bodies weakened  
- Coordinated branch growth  
- Legal cases timed with elections  
- Blanket refusals of transparency  

---

## 11) Policy reforms & mitigations  
- Judicial sign-off  
- Sunset + vote on emergencies  
- Warrants dashboard  
- Empowered inspectorate  
- Transparent procurement  
- Cross-bench oversight committee  

---

## 12) RPG rules — *Angleland: Rise of the NPM*  
- **Stats:** Law, Network, Party, Secrets (start at 1).  
- **Resources:** Spin Tokens (PR firms), Wardrobe (3 garments), Red Flags.  
- **Turn:** Draw event, roll d6 + stat vs Oversight Threshold (7).  
  - Success = stat +1.  
  - Failure = Red Flag. 3 Red Flags = collapse.  
- **Spin Tokens:** Rerolls; unused → Reputation.  
- **The Committee:** every 3 years, roll +Party. Fail twice = out.  o
- **Endgame:**  
  - Law + Party ≥10 → entrenched NPM.  
  - Network + Secrets ≥10 → narrative control.  
  - ≥3 Red Flags → scandal, tribunal, defeat.

## 13) Annex — FOI / PQ templates  
- PQ: “How many warrants of type A/B/C issued in years X–Y?”  
- FOI: procurement & appointment records.
