# 🚩 Angleland Ahoy!  
**First created:** 2025-10-04  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A Capture-the-Flag-cum-Regime-Change parody RPG about who really runs Angleland when everyone claims to love the flag.*

---

## Premise
Angleland has entered its **Perpetual Transition Period**.  
Two factions—the *Traditionaries* and the *Modernocrats*—compete to capture the nation’s flag, its institutions, and its narrative.  
Both swear they’re defending democracy.  
Both have had a ten-year head start.  
Now the public finally notices.

Your team’s task: capture Angleland *entirely*—its borders of meaning, money, and media—before the opposition realises it’s already happened.

---

## Objective
Seize **Five Domains of Capture**:
1. **State Apparatus** – civil service, regulators, royal adjacencies.  
2. **Narrative Control** – press, memes, curriculum.  
3. **Infrastructure** – energy, housing, digital networks.  
4. **Moral Frame** – religion, heritage, outrage economy.  
5. **Future Fiction** – think-tanks, AI policy, children’s television.

Possess three or more simultaneously and you are declared *Governing in Perpetuity*.

---

## Setup
- **Players:** 4–10, divided into two Factions (Traditionary vs Modernocrat).  
- **Timeframe:** Simulated 10 years, each Turn = 6 months.  
- **Resources:** Influence Tokens (ITs), Donor Points (DPs), and Crisis Cards.  
- **Map:** Use any outline of the UK; colour it ideologically.  
- **Victory Condition:** Hold the flag for three consecutive Turns while maintaining plausible deniability.

---

## Basic Turn
1. **Briefing Phase** – roll 1d6 for Scandal Intensity.  
2. **Action Phase** – spend ITs to deploy policies, leaks, or culture wars.  
3. **Public Mood Check** – roll against *Outrage Threshold* (varies by media cycle).  
4. **Audit Phase** – apply *Ethics Modifier* (usually −2).  
5. **End Turn** – update polling; reallocate donors.

---

## Event Examples
- *Royal Scandal Distraction* – gain +2 Reputation but lose 1 Budget Cycle.  
- *Culture War Gone Wrong* – opponent captures Narrative Control.  
- *Infrastructure Sell-Off* – +5 Funds this turn, permanent −2 Public Trust.  
- *AI Consultation Paper* – roll odd: ignored; even: secretly binding treaty.  

---

## Optional Modules
- **🪑 The Committee:** adds sub-games for select committees and lobbying.  
- **♟️ Rise of the NPM:** management-speak combat system.  
- **🧥 The Wardrobe:** optics & rebrand generator.  
- **🃏 Event Cards:** random crises for realism (“pantomime villain goes viral”).  
- **📄 Character Sheets:** design your own minister, donor, or fixer.

---

## Tone & Play
Keep it deadpan: treat absurdities as policy instruments.  
The funniest sessions are the most plausible.  
Encourage players to *speak like reports* and *lie like manifestos*.
