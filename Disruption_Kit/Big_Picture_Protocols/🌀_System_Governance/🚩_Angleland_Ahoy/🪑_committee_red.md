# ðŸª‘ The Red Committee â€” Angleland RPG  

The Red Committee is the loud, mass-membership version of Anglelandâ€™s ruling body. Think conference hall chaos: too many motions, too many chants, too much paper.  

### Traits  
- Delegates, unions, branches, NEC squabbles.  
- Endless amendments, shouted votes, procedural wars.  

### Red Flags  
- Slate voting blocks forming overnight.  
- Union walkouts.  
- NEC expulsions triggered mid-debate.

## Encounter Rules  
Every 3 years, roll +Party.  

- **Success** = survive the Red bear pit (+1 Party).  
- **Failure** = humiliated in front of members (+1 Red Flag, â€“1 Reputation).  
- Fail twice = deselected by motion, booed off stage, career ends.
