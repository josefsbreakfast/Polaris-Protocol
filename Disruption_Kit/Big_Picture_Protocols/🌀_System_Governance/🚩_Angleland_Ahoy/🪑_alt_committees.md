# 🪑 Alternative Committees — Angleland RPG  

Not every Angleland party has a Committee you can meaningfully face down.  
Some collapse under their own contradictions, others implode by design.  

---

## 🟠 Lib Dems  

- **Style:** Earnest, well-meaning, armed with too many flowcharts.  
- **Satire:** Default state is confusion. They walk around as a party but operate like a dice bag.  
- **Lifestyle:** Mostly teetotal. Eggnog at Christmas, then straight back home to cover their side of the parenting rota because their partner’s definitely got a proper job.  
- **Perk:** Free AeroPress + all the gadgets (Apple Watch, Meta glasses, heaps of party data).  
- **Drawback:** Time sinks everywhere — fiddling with the AeroPress, managing family life, still no perfect cup of tea. You lose an extra turn every year.  
- **⭐ Gameplay:** Always roll a **d4**.  
  - 1 = split into two rival micro-committees.  
  - 2 = adopt a policy nobody asked for.  
  - 3 = merge into someone else’s Committee.  
  - 4 = coalition accident! Lose 1 Reputation but gain +1 Party.

## 🌱 Greens  

- **Style:** Idealistic, fractious, still arguing what they actually *are*.  
- **Satire:** You’re either gardening, blazing, or knitting a 14-foot scarf for the village centre. All noble, all time-consuming.  
- **Perk:** Start with +1 **Secrets** (because you’ve always got weed, seeds, or yarn to share).  
- **Drawback:** The lifestyle itself eats your clock. Allotments, smoke sessions, and crochet circles are great for vibes but terrible for consolidating Angleland in 10 years.  
- **⭐ Gameplay:** Roll a **d6** (any dice you like, it doesn’t matter — you’ve got a compost heap and a yarn stash).  
  - 1–2 = lost in the allotment; no change.  
  - 3–4 = knitting circle or smoke circle; vibes only.  
  - 5–6 = the garden (or scarf) flourishes; +1 Party.

## 🟦 Reform  

- **Style:** Trying hard to be a Committee, dressed in a strange shade of blue that doesn’t suit anyone in Angleland.  
- **Satire:** In the Angleland setting, Reform is bluntly portrayed as a racist faction — obsessed with keeping itself pale and exclusive.  
- **Setting:** Nearly everything happens in a pub. Sometimes it’s a dodgy backroom with questionable characters, sometimes a “lovely” country pub where nothing gets decided. Either way, the venue sets the limits of ambition.  
- **Perk:** +2 Party upfront from bloc discipline.  
- **Drawback:** You cannot work with anyone who isn’t white. That cuts you off from most professions, policy expertise, and coalitions. You’re stuck going abroad (hello, Russia).  
- **⭐ Gameplay:** Always roll a **d4**.  
  - 1 = the pub crowd loves you; +1 Party.  
  - 2 = a brawl breaks out; add +1 Red Flag.  
  - 3 = session lost in “lovely” rural pub; no change.  
  - 4 = backroom deal with a questionable character; +1 Secrets but also +1 Red Flag.

## 🎲 Designer’s Note  

Do you honestly think any of these Committees could consolidate full executive control of Angleland in a decade?  

Your call. You’re supposed to *win* the game.
