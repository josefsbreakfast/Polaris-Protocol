# But I Want To Play As...?

Well **tough**.

Why not play as other parties?  
- **Lib Dems:** Do we honestly think they could all agree on one thing long enough to form a Committee?  
- **Greens:** Equally fractious; likely to split into three committees before Year 2.  
- **Reform:** They’re trying, but their strange shade of blue doesn’t suit anyone, least of all Angleland.

Do you honestly think any of them can consolidate full executive control of Angleland in a decade?

Your call; you are supposed to try to **win** the game.
