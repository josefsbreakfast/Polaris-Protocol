# 🪑 Alternative Committees — Angleland RPG  

Not every Angleland party has a Committee you can meaningfully face down.  
Some collapse under their own contradictions, others implode by design.  

---

## 🟠 Lib Dems  

- **Style:** Earnest, well-meaning, and armed with too many flowcharts.  
- **Satire:** They can’t agree on one thing long enough to form a coherent Committee.  
- **⭐ Gameplay:** Auto-collapse by Year 2. Roll a d6:  
  - 1–3 = they split into rival micro-committees.  
  - 4–6 = they quietly merge into someone else’s Committee.  

---

## 🌱 Greens  

- **Style:** Fractious, ecological, and permanently mid-split.  
- **Satire:** Likely to break into three Committees before Year 2.  
- **⭐ Gameplay:** By Year 3, replace them with **3 Mini-Committees**.  
  - Roll +Party separately for each.  
  - Success = +1 Party (eco-wing boost).  
  - Failure = +1 Red Flag (“another schism”).  

---

## 🟦 Reform  

- **Style:** Trying hard to be a Committee, dressed in a strange shade of blue that doesn’t suit anyone in Angleland.  
- **Satire:** In the Angleland setting, Reform is bluntly portrayed as a racist faction — obsessed with keeping itself pale and exclusive.  
- **⭐ Gameplay:** Roll +Party.  
  - Success = you recruit a “True Believer” bloc.  
  - Failure = bloc implodes in recriminations.  
  - Either way, add +1 Red Flag by Year 5 — exclusivity rots coalitions from within.

## 🎲 Designer’s Note  

Do you honestly think any of these Committees could consolidate full executive control of Angleland in a decade?  

Your call. You’re supposed to *win* the game.
