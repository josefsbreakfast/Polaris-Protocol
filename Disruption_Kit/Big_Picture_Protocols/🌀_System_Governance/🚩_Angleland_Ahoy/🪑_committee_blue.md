# ðŸª‘ The Blue Committee â€” Angleland RPG  

The Blue Committee is the elite-gatekeeper version of Anglelandâ€™s ruling body. Less conference, more golf-club AGM and donor dinner.  

### Traits  
- Donor networks, backroom deals, port in cut-glass tumblers.  
- Selection rules written and rewritten behind closed doors.  

### Red Flags  
- Donor-policy overlaps discovered.  
- Sudden rulebook rewrites to block rivals.  
- Elite reshuffles mid-election.  

---

## Encounter Rules  
Every 3 years, roll +Party.  

- **Success** = appease donors and elites (+1 Party).  
- **Failure** = cut out of the deal (+1 Red Flag, â€“1 Reputation).  
- Fail twice = quietly deselected, your seat gifted to someoneâ€™s cousin.
