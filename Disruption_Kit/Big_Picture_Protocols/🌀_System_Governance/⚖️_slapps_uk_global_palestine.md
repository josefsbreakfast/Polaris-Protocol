# ‚öñÔ∏è Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs)

**First created:** 2025-09-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-04  
*Mapping SLAPPs: their function, UK legal course, global context, and implications for solidarity with Palestinian survivors*  

---

## 1. What SLAPPs Are  

- **Definition**: SLAPP = Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.  
- **Purpose**: Not to win on legal merits, but to intimidate, exhaust, or silence critics.  
- **Mechanics**:  
  - Most common in the UK as defamation/libel claims.  
  - Can also use privacy, harassment, or economic tort law.  
  - Weaponises asymmetry of resources: wealthy claimant vs. journalist, NGO, survivor.  

---

## 2. What They Look Like in Practice  

- **High legal costs**: Defending a libel claim in the UK can cost hundreds of thousands.  
- **Stress**: Even winning drains finances and health.  
- **Chilling effect**: Threat letters alone deter reporting.  
- **Survivor context**: For whistleblowers, SLAPP reframes them as perpetrators and silences testimony.

## 3. UK Legal Course (with Dates)  

- **26 Oct 2023** ‚Äî Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act (ECCTA) receives Royal Assent, including limited anti-SLAPP provisions.  
- **18 Jun 2025** ‚Äî Sections 194 & 195 in force: courts can dismiss SLAPPs early; protective cost regimes introduced.  
- **Autumn 2025** ‚Äî Politically sensitive cases (esp. Israel/Palestine) hit renewal points under new regime.  

---

## 4. Global Context  

- **UK as libel tourism hub**: London courts used by oligarchs, corporations, pseudoscientists.  
- Example: Simon Singh sued by British Chiropractic Association (2008) ‚Äî won on appeal after huge costs.  
- **EU**: Draft directive (2022) harmonises protections.  
- **US**: Stronger state-level anti-SLAPP laws (e.g., California).

## 5. SLAPPs in UK Politics (2023‚Äì25)  

- **Dale Vince suits (2023‚Äì25)**: Defamation after Israel‚ÄìGaza comments.  
- **UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI)**: Threatening letters to solidarity events; SRA investigation (2025).  
- **Zahawi‚Äôs lawyer**: Disciplined for SLAPP tactics.  

---

## 6. As Applicable to Solidarity with Palestinian Survivors  

- Palestinian survivors and allies face:  
  1. **Media suppression** ‚Äî chilling effect.  
  2. **Legal silencing** ‚Äî reframing solidarity as extremism/harassment.  
  3. **Institutional asymmetry** ‚Äî wealthy claimants + judicial bias.  

- SLAPPs erase testimony, weaken ICJ/ICC accountability, and punish solidarity as if it were pseudoscience or fraud.  

---

## 7. Crown Servants & SLAPPs  

- **Who counts as Crown Servant**: civil servants, armed forces members, police, diplomats, intelligence officers.  
- **Implications if targeted by SLAPP**:  
  - May trigger dual obligations: personal defence in civil court + duty to Crown.  
  - Risk of gag orders via Official Secrets Act if case touches sensitive information.  
  - Armed forces: risk court martial for speech, not just civil contempt.  
- Effect: Crown servants face **extra silencing pressures** when subject to SLAPPs.  

---

## 8. Why SLAPPs on IHL Issues Are Uniquely Dangerous  

- **Registered professionals** (lawyers, doctors, academics, aid workers)  
  - Bound by codes to speak up on IHL breaches.  
  - SLAPP reframes compliance reporting as misconduct.  

- **Civil service**  
  - Chilled from giving frank advice on treaty obligations (Geneva Conventions, Genocide Convention).  

- **Political parties**  
  - Risk of litigation for public statements outside parliamentary privilege.  

- **Armed forces / MOD personnel**  
  - Double jeopardy: civil SLAPP + military discipline.  
  - Silencing reinforced by chain of command and Official Secrets Act.  

- **MOJ / judiciary actors**  
  - Findings and written opinions risk being turned into libel targets.  

**Net Effect**: Allowing SLAPPs to touch IHL criticism = a systemic attack on the state‚Äôs own ability to comply with international law.

## üèÆ Footer  

This node situates SLAPPs as domestic legal tactic and global service industry.  
It shows how UK libel culture is weaponised against journalists, whistleblowers, survivors ‚Äî and those in solidarity with Palestinians.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
