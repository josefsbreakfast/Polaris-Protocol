# 🗂️ When the System Realises It Fucked Up
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*The internal recognition moment where institutional logic breaks.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
This node documents the moment an institution collectively recognises that its actions do not align with policy, proportionality, or internal logic.

This is not a moral reckoning.  
It is a procedural one.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Discovery through paperwork, not whistleblowing  
- Recognition of incoherence rather than blame  
- Sudden internal scrutiny and cross-checking  
- Shift from confidence to caution

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. **The Trigger**
Often initiated by:
- SAR / DSAR review  
- audit  
- external query  
- internal handover  

Someone notices inconsistencies.

### 2. **The Pause**
Activity slows.
New actions are deferred.
The system stops adding layers.

### 3. **The Realisation**
The core recognition is simple:
> “This does not make sense.”

Not “who did this?”  
But “why did we do this?”

### 4. **Risk Awareness**
Once incoherence is seen, liability awareness follows quickly.
