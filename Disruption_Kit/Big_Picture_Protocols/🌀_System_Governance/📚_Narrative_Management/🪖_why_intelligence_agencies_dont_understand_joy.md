## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Built for Threat, Not Pleasure  
Their epistemic architecture is adversarial.

### 2. Bureaucratic Paranoia Cannot Model Rhythm  
Joy looks irrelevant or suspicious.

### 3. Psyops Produce Resistance; Joy Produces Attachment  
Coercion cannot compete with voluntary joy.

### 4. Pop Culture Outperforms Psyops  
Fandom scales; manipulation doesn’t.

### 5. Joy Looks “Frivolous”  
So agencies ignore the strongest influence vector.
