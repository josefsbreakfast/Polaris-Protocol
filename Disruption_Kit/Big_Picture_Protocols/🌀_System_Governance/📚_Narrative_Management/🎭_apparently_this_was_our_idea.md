# 🎭 Apparently, This Was Our Idea  
**First created:** 2025-12-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-23  
*A satirical note on leadership, consent, and the strange habit of obeying imaginary instructions.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This is satire.

It is not satire about hunger strikers.  
It is not satire about suffering.  
People’s lives are on the line, and that is not funny.

What *is* funny — in the bleak, British sense — is how easily we sometimes allow ourselves to be told what to do and then nod solemnly as if we’d thought of it ourselves.

This note is aimed mostly at leadership.  
But the public is not completely off the hook.

---

## 🧠 A brief recap of the absurdity  
Somewhere in the last stretch, a strange thing happened.

A number of politicians and commentators appeared to accept the following invisible memo:

> “Due to reasons that will not be specified,  
> you must now treat certain conversations as off-limits,  
> certain people as unserious,  
> and certain deaths as unfortunate but unavoidable.  
>  
> Please behave as if this was your own judgement.  
> Thank you.”

And instead of asking who sent the memo,  
or why it exists,  
or why it sounds like it was written by a committee of ghosts,

we largely went:
> “Yes. Sensible. Very difficult. No choice, really.”

---

## 🧠 Leadership, in particular  
There is a special kind of modern leadership voice that says:

> “My hands are tied.”

This voice never explains:
- *who* tied them,  
- *when* they were tied,  
- or *why* they didn’t object at the time.

It simply gestures vaguely at:
- “the situation”,  
- “the climate”,  
- “public opinion”,  
- “security concerns”,  

as if these were natural disasters rather than human-made conditions.

Satirically speaking, it’s an impressive trick:
to lose agency so completely while still holding office.

---

## 🗳️ The public bit (sorry, but gently)  
We also deserve a small look in the mirror.

At various points, many of us have thought:
- “This feels wrong, but I assume someone clever has decided it’s necessary.”
- “I don’t like it, but I don’t want to be irresponsible.”
- “I suppose this is just how things are now.”

Which is an odd conclusion to reach in a democracy,
given that *we are the demo*.

It’s a bit like standing in your own living room,
being told to sit on the floor,
and thinking:
> “Well. There must be a reason.”

---

## 🧠 The core joke (and it’s not really a joke)  
The funniest part — if you have a dark sense of humour —  
is not that pressure exists.

Pressure always exists.

It’s that we sometimes act as if:
- intimidation is weather,
- silence is wisdom,
- and letting things drift is neutrality.

As if democracy were a passive state,
rather than something that visibly operates or visibly fails.

---

## ⚖️ The non-satirical line (important)  
Here is where the joke stops.

When people are on hunger strike,
the question is not:
> “Is this convenient?”  
> “Is this tidy?”  
> “Is this reputationally awkward?”

The question is:
> “Are we really prepared to say that nobody had agency here?”

Because that is the point at which satire turns into tragedy.

---

## 🧠 What this note is actually for  
This satire exists to do one thing:

To make it slightly embarrassing —  
in a very British way —  
to pretend that obvious moral and democratic choices
are acts of nature.

It is a reminder that:
- pressure only works if it is treated as authority,
- silence only works if it is mistaken for consent,
- and “we had no choice” is usually said *after* a choice was made.

---

## 🧠 Final grounding  
If you ever catch yourself thinking:
> “Well, I suppose this is just how it has to be…”

It’s worth pausing and asking:
> “According to whom?”  
> “Since when?”  
> “And why exactly am I pretending this was my idea?”

Democracy doesn’t usually collapse with a bang.

More often, it politely agrees to things
and hopes nobody notices.

*Apparently This Was Our Idea* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It uses humour to return agency to where it belongs.
