# ⚖️ Election Candidacy Query
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-13  
*Interrogating gatekeeping, donor mapping, and reputational filtering in UK political candidacy.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
This node examines how reputational containment, elite networks, and donor dependencies shape who may *stand*—and who is structurally prevented—from doing so.  
It links political vetting to broader systems of **social credit and suppression** that extend beyond party boundaries.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Gatekeeping by reputation** — media and vetting committees as parallel judiciary.  
- **Donor mapping** — tracing influence flows between wealth, lobbying, and candidate viability.  
- **Elite capture loops** — self-perpetuating cycles of institutional loyalty.

---

## 🧿 Analysis / Content
Candidacy is increasingly treated as brand management rather than democratic eligibility.  
Those with complex or survivor histories are filtered out as “risk”.  
Transparency becomes threat; neutrality becomes prerequisite for advancement.  
In this schema, control of narrative equals control of access.
