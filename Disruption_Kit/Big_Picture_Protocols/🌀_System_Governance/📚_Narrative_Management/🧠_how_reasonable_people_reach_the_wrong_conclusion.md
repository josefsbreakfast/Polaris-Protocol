# 🧠 How Reasonable People Reach the Wrong Conclusion  
**First created:** 2025-12-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-23  
*On presupposition, journalistic distance, and why assumptions harden so quickly.*
<!--Hm. This node is **really** struggling to generate cleanly. For ref, I'm talking about how this doesn't look classically alike to Palestine Action, doesn't make sense under their current strategy for escalation, and instances like this are worth cautioning without clear knowledge or claim, as "add-on violence in style of group X" can functional structurally akin to how Freikorps operated, in that Nazis go "false flag" heavy because they are the most unoriginal people on planet Earth. https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRj1M34a -->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node is about **how narratives form**, not about accusing anyone of intent.

It does not claim:
- that journalists are acting in bad faith,
- that institutions are coordinating messaging,
- or that readers are foolish for drawing intuitive conclusions.

What it does is trace how **perfectly reasonable assumptions** can still produce misleading stories — especially under time pressure, emotional load, and partial information.

---

## 🔍 Presupposition Is Not Propaganda (But It Still Matters)  
Sometimes wording does not *state* a conclusion — it **presupposes** one.

This often happens unintentionally when:
- context is incomplete,
- deadlines are tight,
- and certain associations are already culturally primed.

When phrasing subtly frames an act as a “response to” a particular campaign, readers naturally fill in the gaps with what they already know.

That is not manipulation.  
That is **human inference**.

But the downstream effect is still real.

---

## 📰 Why This Happens Even in Sceptical or Critical Outlets  
There’s a point worth making clearly, because it’s often missed across the political spectrum:

Journalists on the left are not necessarily embedded in every left-wing movement they cover.

Many:
- write for a *broad* progressive or left-leaning readership,
- operate from professional distance,
- and are not involved in long-term organising or campaign strategy.

As a result, their internal model of a movement may be shaped more by:
- headlines,
- previous coverage,
- visual similarity to past actions,
- and what “looks like” a familiar protest form,

rather than by deep familiarity with how a specific campaign actually operates.

That doesn’t make them malicious.  
It makes them **adjacent**, not embedded.

---

## 🧠 Why the Assumption Feels Convincing  
From the perspective of an average UK reader — including those on the right, centre, or less radical left — the inference often runs like this:

- “There are hunger strikers associated with Palestine Action.”
- “There has been disruptive or symbolic damage.”
- “I’ve seen Palestine Action target buildings before.”

So the brain concludes:
> “This is probably that.”

That conclusion feels *reasonable* — even when it turns out to be wrong.

This is exactly why precision matters most when things feel obvious.

---

## 🧱 Why This Action Does Not Match Known Campaign Patterns  
For readers unfamiliar with the internal logic of direct-action campaigns, it’s worth stating plainly:

- Palestine Action actions overwhelmingly target:
  - arms manufacturers,
  - weapons infrastructure,
  - or entities directly linked to material complicity.
- Politicians, when targeted, are usually engaged through:
  - letters,
  - lobbying,
  - public accountability campaigns,
  - or tightly symbolic protest — not property damage.

From a **risk–benefit perspective**, party offices are a poor strategic target:
- high narrative risk,
- low leverage,
- and minimal capacity to force democratic engagement.

That mismatch should **slow attribution**, not accelerate it.

---

## 🌪️ Another Plausible Explanation: Anger Without Alignment  
There is also a simpler explanation that does not require conspiracy or coordination.

What we may be seeing is **legitimate, localised anger** directed at the Labour Party, arising from:
- long-term economic decline,
- austerity,
- regional neglect,
- and decades of broken promises.

In areas heavily shaped by:
- deindustrialisation,
- Thatcher-era restructuring,
- and post-austerity stagnation,

anger does not always express itself cleanly or strategically.

People sometimes:
- borrow the language of visible movements,
- attach themselves rhetorically to morally legible causes,
- or frame actions under a banner that already exists.

This is not unique to the left.  
It is a documented feature of political radicalisation across ideologies.

---

## 🧠 A Useful Comparative Insight  
In studies of radicalised behaviour, a consistent finding is that:
- the *justification* (religious, ideological, moral)
- often comes **after** the emotional driver (anger, grievance, loss).

The ideology explains the action.  
It does not always cause it.

That distinction matters when assessing responsibility and response.

---

## ⚠️ Why Getting This Wrong Has Consequences  
When assumptions harden too quickly:
- movements are blamed for actions they did not plan,
- institutions respond to the wrong threat,
- and people whose lives are at risk — including hunger strikers — are pushed further from view.

Precision here is not pedantry.  
It is **harm reduction**.

---

## 🛡️ The Responsible Stance  
The most responsible position is not certainty, but restraint.

That looks like:
- acknowledging what we *don’t* know,
- distinguishing appearance from pattern,
- resisting narrative shortcuts — even when they feel intuitive.

This protects:
- democratic legitimacy,
- journalistic integrity,
- and public trust.

---

## 🧩 Final Grounding  
It is easy, under pressure, to tell a story that *feels* right.

It is harder — and more important — to tell a story that is careful.

Democracy depends less on outrage than on **accuracy when things are messy**.

---

## 🕰️ Echoes of History: Addressing The Antifascist's "Obvious"  
This is the point where people often get uncomfortable — so it’s worth being explicit.

When people reference the Weimar Republic, or groups like the Freikorps and the SA, they are usually *not* saying:
> “This is exactly the same.”  
> “These people are Nazis.”  
> “History is repeating one-to-one.”

That interpretation is a misunderstanding — and often a convenient way to avoid the discussion.

What is being flagged is **function**, not costume.

---

## 🧠 What Those Groups Did (Functionally)  
Historically, groups like the Freikorps and later the SA were not primarily significant because of:
- ideological purity,
- moral consistency,
- or disciplined command structures.

They mattered because of **effect**.

They generated:
- ambient instability,
- violence with blurred authorship,
- constant pressure on public order,
- and a pervasive sense that democratic governance could not cope.

This instability did not need to be centrally planned to be useful.

It created conditions in which:
- emergency powers felt reasonable,
- repression felt necessary,
- and executive consolidation could be framed as “restoring order”.

That is the mechanism worth remembering.

---

## 🔄 Why This Matters for How We Read Violence Now  
Different political traditions use violence differently.

Disciplined direct-action movements tend to:
- escalate *towards* their original targets,
- accept arrest to expose unjust law,
- use symbolism to clarify demands,
- and aim to force engagement, not systemic collapse.

Violence that:
- widens fear rather than clarifies injustice,
- blurs responsibility,
- accelerates polarisation,
- and makes democratic mediation appear impossible,

has historically **benefited authoritarian consolidation**, regardless of intent.

That does not mean “this is fascism”.  
It means the **effect is familiar**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Point Is Often Misheard  
When people hear references to the Freikorps or SA, they often hear accusation.

What is actually being said is much narrower:

> “There is a documented historical pattern in which destabilising violence — especially with unclear attribution — weakens democratic confidence and primes publics for harder measures.”

That is not an insult.  
It is a warning label.

---

## 🏛️ The Weimar Parallel (Structure, Not Prophecy)  
The Weimar Republic did not fall because people wanted dictatorship overnight.

It fell because:
- democratic institutions tried to manage pressure through appeasement,
- exceptional measures were normalised incrementally,
- and instability itself was underestimated as a political force.

That is why comparisons arise when modern governments appear stuck between:
- democratic legitimacy,
- security pressure,
- and fear of escalation.

This is not about saying “we are Weimar”.  
It is about recognising **how democracies erode when pressure is misread**.

---

## ⚖️ Why Precision Still Matters  
If every disruptive act is collapsed into “the radical left”:
- responsibility is misattributed,
- authoritarians gain narrative leverage,
- overreach is justified,
- and life-saving interventions are delayed.

But if we refuse to discuss how destabilising violence has historically functioned, we blind ourselves to early warning signs.

Both errors are dangerous.

---

## 🧠 The Responsible Position (Again)  
The responsible position is not certainty.  
It is **restraint and pattern literacy**.

That means:
- not assuming attribution without evidence,
- not pretending all violence functions the same way,
- and not treating history as unsayable because it makes people uncomfortable.

History is not a script.  
It is a catalogue of failure modes.

Ignoring those modes does not make us wiser.  
It just means we repeat them with better technology.

---

## 🧱 Closing Grounding  
This is not about calling names.

It is about refusing to be naïve about dynamics.

Naming historical mechanisms early is not alarmism.  
It is **maintenance**.

And maintenance is how democracies survive pressure.
