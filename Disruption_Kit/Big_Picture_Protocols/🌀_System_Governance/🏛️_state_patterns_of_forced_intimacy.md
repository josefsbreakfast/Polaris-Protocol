**First created:** 2025-09-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-14  
*How state systems weaponise enforced proximity, repression, and intimacy to destabilise people*  

---

## ✨ Summary  
Across regimes and eras, governments have used enforced intimacy as a control technique.  
The design logic is consistent: restrict freedom, deny consent, force proximity, and count on repression and taboo to destabilise.  

---

## 👻 Historical Patterns  

- **East German Stasi (Zersetzung):**  
  Engineered relationship breakdowns by planting informants in marriages, friendships, and workplaces.  
  Survivors describe this as *psychological torture by entanglement.*  

- **Apartheid South Africa – Security Branch:**  
  Detainees were placed with collaborators or suspected informants, turning cell-mates into surveillance nodes.  
  Trust collapsed under the pressure of enforced intimacy.  

- **Internment Camps (WWII – Japanese & Allied):**  
  Populations confined together under constant surveillance, with repressed social tensions (class, gender, politics) amplified until they self-policed.  

- **CIA Manuals (1960s–70s):**  
  Documented the destabilising effects of isolation and sexual repression.  
  Repression itself was weaponised as a lever to break resistance.

## 🎏 Contemporary Echoes  

- **Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Programs:**  
  Pairing “at-risk” people with mentors or monitors in arrangements often experienced as coercive.  
  *Friendship with a file* — intimacy shadowed by surveillance.  

- **Immigration Detention Buddy Systems:**  
  Forced cohabitation with strangers, rivals, or informants, under total observation.  
  Designed to trigger projection, friction, and collapse of solidarity.

## 🧠 Shared Logic  

- Restrict freedom of movement.  
- Force intimacy or proximity.  
- Deny consent and release.  
- Rely on repression and taboo as destabilisation engines.  

This is the same pattern as *Metadata Twinning*: enforced chastity play without consent or resolution, scaled into bureaucratic governance.

*State Patterns of Forced Intimacy* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how authoritarian and democratic states alike have used proximity, repression, and enforced intimacy to manage populations and break solidarity.
