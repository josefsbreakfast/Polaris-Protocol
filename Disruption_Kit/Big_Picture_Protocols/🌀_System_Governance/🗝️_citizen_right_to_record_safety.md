*The refusal to confirm the safety of sealed CSA/rape records, even after signs of breach, becomes structural cruelty.*  

---

For over a year and a half I have asked one basic question:  

**Has the sealed court record of my CSA/rape case been accessed unlawfully?**  

Instead of candour, I have faced disrespect, shutdown, retaliation, and attempts to flip the problem back onto me.  

I know something is odd.  
I know there has been interference.  
I know a Google bombing suggested a data breach.  

It should not be this hard.  
It should not be treated as if *I* am the problem for asking.  
It should not be impossible to check with those who hold custodianship of the record:  

“Hi. Can you let me know it is safe?”  

Yes, the record belongs to the Crown.  
Yes, it is formally no longer “my” data.  
But it is my childhood’s body, my name, my testimony.  
It is highly privileged information.  
I should be able to ask if it is safe.

*Citizen Right to Record Safety* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how the refusal to confirm the safety of sealed CSA/rape records — even when evidence of breach exists — constitutes systemic cruelty. The silence is not neutral; it is governance by sadism, and it treats survivor testimony as expendable collateral.
