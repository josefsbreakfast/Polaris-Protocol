# ⚖️ IPCO Audit Cycle  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Oversight inspections of UK intelligence services*  

The watchers get watched, or so the story goes. Survivors know that being watched twice doesn’t always make you safer.  

---  

## Routine Inspections  
- **Frequency**: typically twice yearly for each agency.  
- **Scope**: warrant execution, data retention, deletion, compliance logs.  

## Sampling  
- IPCO inspectors independently draw **random and stratified samples** from live warrant databases.  
- They review necessity, proportionality, handling, and deletion.  
- Risk-based targeting supplements randomness.  

## Enforcement  
- Minor errors: written recommendations.  
- Systemic failures: formal compliance notices.  
- Serious breaches: suspension of powers, mandatory data destruction, reports to PM & ISC.  

## Reporting  
- Classified reports to ministers.  
- Public annual report to Parliament.  
- Findings can be escalated to the IPT for remedies.

Random samples don’t feel random when your life is the dataset. Survivors become the anomalies that audits can’t quite resolve.
