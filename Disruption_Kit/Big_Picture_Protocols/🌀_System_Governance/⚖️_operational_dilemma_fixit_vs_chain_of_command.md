# ⚖️ Operational Dilemma: Fix It vs Chain of Command  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-06    
*Weighing the risks of direct internal fixes against using formal oversight pathways.*

---

## 🪄 Path A — Fix It Internally  
- Fastest loop, less leakage, fewer veto points.  
- Risks: mandate questions, accusations of cover-up, vulnerable to capture.  
- Safeguards: legal basis memo, independent counsel, write-once log, harm review gate.  

---

## 🐝 Path B — Use the Chain of Command  
- Legitimacy and durability.  
- Risks: delay, selective disclosure, sandbagging.  
- Tools: time-boxed safe-harbour, compel notices, parallel secure intake.  

---

## 🪷 Path C — Hybrid Cleanroom  
- Independent “clean team” with judicial/commissioner oversight.  
- Tools: data escrow, provenance tagging, privacy budgets, whistleblower intake, amnesty + compulsion.
