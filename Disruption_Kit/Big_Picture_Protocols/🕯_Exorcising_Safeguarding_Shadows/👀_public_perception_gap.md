# 👀 Public Perception Gap  
**First created:** 2025-08-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-28  
*Analysis of how optics distort recognition of harm and enable institutional silencing.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

This module examines the widening gap between **public perception** and **actual institutional targeting**.  
Focus: how “acceptable” identities are used to mask repression, how respectable dissent is selectively validated, and how cultural myths about safety, extremism, and legitimacy distort recognition of real harm.  

---

## 🧠 Core Premise  

> **“If you don’t *look* like a threat, people assume you can’t be harmed — even while you’re being dismantled.”**  

- Perception follows *media cues* and *institutional signalling*, not material conditions.  
- Victims of metadata targeting, state surveillance, or AI manipulation are often disbelieved if they don’t fit dominant narratives of threat or victimhood.

## 🍄 Perception Mismatch Examples  

### 1. 👩‍🎓 Educated Women  
- Assumed to have institutional protection or advocacy.  
- When targeted (Prevent, smear campaigns, metadata suppression), reports are reframed as overreaction or delusion.  
- Frequently positioned as symbolic defenders of the state — dissent becomes especially destabilising.  

### 2. 🧕 Muslim Women  
- Over-policed in schools and welfare, yet perceived as either oppressed or protected by multicultural policy.  
- Actual surveillance and ideological containment are misframed as “care” or “welfare.”  

### 3. 🏳️‍🌈 White Gay Men  
- Used as proof of progressiveness by institutions enabling racism or misogyny.  
- Often granted narrative legitimacy, while dissenting queer Black or Muslim voices are sidelined.  

### 4. 🍉 Jewish Critics of Zionism  
- Targeted with metadata erasure and narrative sabotage.  
- Public assumes protection via antisemitism frameworks, while the state weaponises Jewish identity to silence dissent (e.g., anti-occupation, antifascist organising).

## 🪞 Flat Optics vs Layered Reality  

| Perception Layer | Reality Layer |
|------------------|---------------|
| “They’re being looked after.” | Under metadata-based behavioural control. |
| “It’s a misunderstanding.” | It’s a strategic classification and targeting design. |
| “They have support.” | Support disabled, co-opted, or algorithmically removed. |
| “They’re overreacting.” | Reactions shaped by cumulative metadata loops and behavioural nudging. |

---

## ⚠️ Structural Risks  

- **Weaponised Stereotypes**: Dissenters cast as unstable, threatening, or ungrateful when outside approved optics.  
- **Narrative Shields**: Repression hidden behind curated poster figures, charities, or faux-accountability bodies.  
- **Visibility Gaps**: Harm minimised or misclassified when it contradicts dominant storylines.

## 🛰️ Institutional Amplifiers  

| Entity | Role |
|--------|------|
| Mainstream Media | Flattens complexity, reinforces “safe” dissent narratives |
| Charity Sector | Legitimises select figures, excludes disruptive voices |
| Safeguarding Bodies | Labels outliers as unstable or dangerous, not political |
| Civil Service Comms | Scripts public perception to match pre-cleared narratives |
| AI Moderation | Algorithmically erases dissent outside optics templates |

## 💫 Case Notes for Polaris Users  

- **Did Your Support Vanish?** → If allies or services disappeared *after* escalation, check for metadata manipulation.  
- **Were You Miscast?** → Review how you’re described in records, policies, safeguarding notes — does it match your reality?  
- **Are You the “Wrong” Kind of Victim?** → If your identity disrupts dominant power optics (e.g., Muslim survivor of state violence), you may be narrative-silenced.  
- **Check Who Gets Believed** → Is someone else allowed to say what you’ve said — only more “palatably”? That’s a perception gap.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Public Perception Gap* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It analyses how institutional optics distort harm recognition, creating narrative shields that silence survivor voices.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
