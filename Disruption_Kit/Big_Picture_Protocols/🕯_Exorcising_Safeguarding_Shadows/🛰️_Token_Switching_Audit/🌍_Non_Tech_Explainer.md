# 🌍 Non-Tech Explainer: Token Switching  

**First created:** 2025-09-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  

*Plain-language guidance for operations, governance officers, and leadership.*

## What is token switching?  
Imagine a hospital where two patients secretly swap their name tags. Each gets the other’s chart, tests, and medicine. In digital twin systems used for planning and emergency response, something similar can happen: **an attacker reassigns digital identity tokens between people.**  

This creates false records. A dangerous individual can be mislabelled as safe, or two people can be kept artificially apart without anyone setting an explicit “danger” flag.  

---

## Why it matters  
- **Safety risk:** emergency services may route people away incorrectly.  
- **Trust risk:** if identity data is unreliable, the whole system loses credibility.  
- **Governance risk:** tampering undermines accountability and may conceal abuse.  

---

## Signs of token switching (non-technical)  
- Duplicate or near-duplicate records.  
- Sudden changes in someone’s “official” ID.  
- Reports that conflict (one file says A, another says B).  
- Alerts triggered for the wrong person.  

---

## What to do if you suspect it  
1. **Preserve evidence** — do not edit or “fix” records yourself.  
2. **Escalate immediately** — report anomalies to the audit team.  
3. **Two-person rule** — require dual approval for ID changes.  
4. **Demand logs** — ask IT to export audit trails before changes are made.
