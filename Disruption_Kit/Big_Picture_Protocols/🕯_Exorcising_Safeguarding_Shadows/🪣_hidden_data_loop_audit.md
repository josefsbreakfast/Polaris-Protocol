# 🪣 Hidden Data-Loop Audit  
**First created:** 2025-10-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-06  
*Guide for recognising when cross-system data translation or identifier errors create invisible feedback loops that damage individual records.*

---

## 🧭 Summary  
Large public and institutional databases often depend on shared identifiers — NHS numbers, NI numbers, case IDs — to exchange data.  
A single formatting or translation bug in those key fields can split, duplicate or mis-route a person’s record across systems.  
The effect is diffuse and hard to detect: catastrophic for individuals, invisible at scale.  
This node provides a field checklist for spotting the pattern and building evidence that a hidden data-loop exists.

## 🧾 Hidden Data-Loop Audit — Field Symptoms Checklist  

### 1️⃣ Identity and Key-Field Symptoms
| Category | What to watch for | Why it matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Identifiers mismatch** | Missing leading zeros, swapped digits, truncated names | Points to encoding or migration error |
| **Record “shadowing”** | Two nearly-identical profiles exist in parallel systems | Duplicate IDs created by format error |
| **Cross-system auth failure** | Works on one portal but not another | Data not syncing through shared ID service |

---

### 2️⃣ Transaction / Case-Flow Symptoms
| Category | What to watch for | Why it matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Process restarts** | Every contact creates a new reference number | Backend can’t recognise existing record |
| **Phantom escalations / loops** | “Under review” forever or bounced between offices | Mis-routed workflow queue |
| **Asymmetric correspondence** | Your emails arrive but their replies don’t | Permissions split between mirrored systems |

---

### 3️⃣ Document and Data-Access Symptoms
| Category | What to watch for | Why it matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **SAR / FOI inconsistencies** | Different agencies return different records | Divergence after shared export |
| **Audit-trail discontinuities** | “Sent” in one log but no “received” in another | Transformation-layer loss |
| **Metadata anomalies** | Impossible dates or corrupted filenames | Left by manual patching or deduplication |

---

### 4️⃣ Behavioural / Institutional Symptoms
| Category | What to watch for | Why it matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Contradictory explanations** | Officials give opposite reasons for same issue | Each sees different fragment of error |
| **Sudden reversals** | Case “resolved” without action from you | Hidden flag corrected silently |
| **Silence through escalation** | Contact ceases once it goes “higher up” | National interface lock or routing error |

---

### 5️⃣ Evidence-Building Tips  
- Date-stamp every interaction.  
- Keep screenshots of system messages and reference numbers.  
- Log discrepancies verbatim (copy/paste).  
- Cross-compare SAR outputs for field divergence.  
- Note staff comments like “that’s odd.” They’re micro-evidence.

---

### 6️⃣ Escalation Channels  
If multiple bodies show the pattern:  
1. Write to each Data Protection Officer with summary evidence.  
2. Ask explicitly whether a shared identifier or interface error could be responsible.  
3. If two or more confirm mismatch, escalate to the ICO for a **Section 165 systemic issue complaint**.
