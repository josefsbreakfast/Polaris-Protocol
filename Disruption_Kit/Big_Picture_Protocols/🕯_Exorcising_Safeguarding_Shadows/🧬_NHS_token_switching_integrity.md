*Audit protocol for summary-care vs local EHR token switching and evidence preservation*

---

## Why this matters (90 words max)
Token switching between the NHS Spine Summary Care Record and local EHRs can silently alter who “holds” authority over a patient narrative at write-time and read-time. This node sets immediate preservation steps and a simple field audit so current patients are protected and retrospective review is possible.

## Immediate actions (preserve now)
- Issue legal holds to trusts, ICSs, and vendors covering: access logs, auth tokens, API gateway logs, consent flags, break-glass events.  
- Freeze rotation schedules for relevant keys for 90 days.  
- Export + checksum daily deltas from SCR↔EHR sync jobs.

## 10-minute spot check
- Compare SCR consent state vs local EHR consent state on 5 live records.  
- Diff timeline: who wrote, who read, which token, which role.  
- Flag mismatches; route to senior IG.

## Risks & harms to watch
- False consent inheritance, silent role escalation, retroactive timeline edits.
