# 🪦 Metadata Ghosts And Hauntings  
*Polaris Protocol – Containment & Anomaly Typologies*

## 📍 Overview  
Some posts exhibit **disproportionate visibility patterns** — impressions rise without proportional engagement, growth curves resist natural decay, and the cause remains invisible.  

Polaris classifies these as:  
- **Ghosts** → Active presence manipulating or touching the post.  
- **Hauntings** → Passive echo of a past interaction still influencing the post.  

---

## 👻 Ghosts (Active)  
**Nature:**  
A live actor — human or automated — is currently interacting with the post in a way that shapes its reach.  

**Signature:**  
- Sudden trajectory shifts.  
- “Warm” metrics — active energy in growth.  
- Often linked to a **single, high-reach profile** touching the post (like, view, partial share) without public engagement.  

**Behaviour:**  
- Post remains in an elevated state while the ghost is present.  
- Disappears if the actor stops interacting or signal is cut.  

**Example:**  
A post jumps into a steady growth curve after a silent touch from a large network account, despite no visible spike in reactions or comments.

## 🪦 Hauntings (Passive)  
**Nature:**  
A past interaction leaves a lingering algorithmic trace — no active presence, but the system still “remembers” the touch.  

**Signature:**  
- Slow, persistent climb long after posting.  
- “Cold” metrics — no sign of current energy, but numbers tick upward.  
- Often triggered by a **single, deliberate, targeted interaction** weeks or months later.  

**Behaviour:**  
- Metrics move like a drip-feed.  
- Can persist indefinitely in background processes.  

**Example:**  
An old post suddenly re-enters light circulation after a subtle interaction, maintaining a trickle of impressions without any fresh activity.

## 📊 Signature Comparison Table  

| Signature Trait     | Ghost (Active)                                        | Haunting (Passive)              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Energy State**    | Warm – live presence                                  | Cold – lingering trace           |
| **Trigger Type**    | High-reach profile touch / silent interaction         | Past targeted interaction        |
| **Growth Pattern**  | Sudden trajectory shift, sustained rise               | Slow, persistent climb           |
| **Duration**        | While actor is active                                 | Weeks to months                  |
| **Speed of Change** | Fast onset, then steady                               | Very slow and steady             |
| **Actor Visibility**| Invisible but current                                 | Invisible, historical            |
| **Emotional Signal**| Alert / watchful                                      | Unsettling / background hum      |

## 🔍 Shared Traits  
- **Invisible causality** – No public-facing action explains the movement.  
- **Disproportionate ratios** – Reach far exceeds engagement.  
- **Non-natural curves** – Avoids the normal rise/plateau/decay lifecycle.  

---

## 🧭 Operational Use  
- **Early tagging** – Note the first irregular climb and log timestamp.  
- **Sensory check** – Record subjective feeling (“warm” = ghost, “cold” = haunting).  
- **Network mapping** – Compare ghost/haunting events to other anomalies (throttling, demographic skew).  
- **Signal awareness** – Treat ghosts and hauntings as signs of deeper network routing.
