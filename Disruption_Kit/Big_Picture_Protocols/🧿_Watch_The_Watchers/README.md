## 🌱 Scope  

This folder gathers nodes where the camera, the log, or the archive is turned back on the observer.  
It is not passive witness — it is active inversion.  

Examples include:  
- Street photography of secret police and plainclothes operatives  
- Protester documentation of undercover agents  
- Community practices of naming and exposing surveillance actors  
- Tactical use of images, leaks, or metadata to disrupt secrecy

## 📡 Cross-References  

- [👁️‍🗨️ Witness Histories](../👁️‍🗨️_Witness_Historical_Casefiles) — aligned but not the same; witness becomes strategy here  
- [🗝️ Politics & Memory Work](../🗝️_Politics_Memory_Work) — where exposure contests erasure  
- [Disruption Kit](../../Disruption_Kit) — survivor-led tools, field logs, countermeasures
