# 🧿 Watch the Watchers  
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Protocol branch tracing practices of counter-surveillance, citizen documentation, and exposure of covert power*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

This cluster gathers nodes where surveillance is turned inside-out.  
The watcher is watched, the secret policeman photographed, the contractor logged, the badge mocked.  
It is not passive witness — it is active inversion, a survival tactic, and often a form of art.
