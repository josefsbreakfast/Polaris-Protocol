## 🌱 Scope  

This folder gathers nodes where the camera, the log, or the archive is turned back on the observer.  
It is not passive witness — it is active inversion.  

Here, the gaze is reversed.  
Where the state watches, citizens watch back.  
Where secrecy thrives, exposure becomes survival.  

Examples include:  
- Street photography of secret police and plainclothes operatives  
- Protester documentation of undercover agents  
- Community practices of naming and exposing surveillance actors  
- Tactical use of images, leaks, or metadata to disrupt secrecy  

Like George Smiley in *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*, the work is often patient, weary, and forensic.  
Like Winston in *1984*, it sometimes feels futile until the document itself survives as proof.  
Like *The Lives of Others*, it reminds us that listening can be turned back into testimony.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🧿 📸 🔮 🎥 — Counter-surveillance is both archive and cinema: part Brontë gothic, part Snowden documentary.  
It threads through novels like *Jane Eyre*, dystopias like *The Circle*, and films like *Citizenfour*.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Watch the Watchers* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers protocols and testimonies where surveillance itself becomes the object of scrutiny.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
