## 🧭 Orientation  

Street photography has not always been about art or “the decisive moment.”  
Sometimes it became a weapon — a way of watching the watchers.  

Across different contexts, the act of photographing secret police or covert agents carried risks, but also meanings: to expose, to preserve memory, to deter, or to signal danger.

## 🧩 Case Trajectories  

### **Eastern Bloc (1940s–80s)**  
- **Goal:** Preserve evidence for the future.  
- **Dynamic:** Dissidents and underground artists quietly documented *Stasi* and militia surveillance.  
- **Logic:** Cameras made state power visible, archivable, nameable.  

---

### **Latin America Dictatorships (1970s–80s)**  
- **Goal:** Map survival networks.  
- **Dynamic:** Families and activists photographed suspected plainclothes agents.  
- **Logic:** Building files to identify perpetrators of disappearances; camera as counter-intelligence.  

---

### **South Africa (1960s–90s)**  
- **Goal:** International witness.  
- **Dynamic:** Township photographers captured security police at protests and funerals.  
- **Logic:** Images travelled abroad, legitimising the anti-apartheid struggle.  

---

### **Northern Ireland (Troubles, 1970s–90s)**  
- **Goal:** Exposure & deterrence.  
- **Dynamic:** Local photographers caught plainclothes operatives at marches.  
- **Logic:** Breaking cover in tightly watched communities disrupted surveillance effectiveness.  

---

### **Hong Kong (2019–20)**  
- **Goal:** Real-time tactical warning.  
- **Dynamic:** Protest photographers shared images of suspected undercover officers via encrypted apps.  
- **Logic:** Photography became live protection, alerting others not to trust or approach.

## 🔑 Cross-Cutting Goals  

- **Evidence:** For courts, history, or future testimony.  
- **Survival:** Knowing who followed you, and who disappeared others.  
- **Exposure:** Turning the “secret” policeman into a visible actor.  
- **Deterrence:** Blowing cover as disruption.  
- **Tactical Warning:** Immediate signals to communities in motion.

## 📊 Visual Schema  

Street photography, when turned against secret police, branched into five strategic goals.  
Each goal carried distinct logics and contexts:

> - 📜 **Evidence** — Eastern Bloc (Stasi archives, memory for the future)  
> - 🧭 **Survival** — Latin America (dictatorships, mapping perpetrators)  
> - 🔍 **Exposure** — South Africa (apartheid policing, international witness)  
> - 🚨 **Deterrence** — Northern Ireland (Troubles, blowing cover)  
> - ⚡ **Tactical Warning** — Hong Kong (2019–20 protests, live alerts)
