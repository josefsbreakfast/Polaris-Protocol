*How minority communities reposition culpability and invite outside regulators to uncover truth.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

In diaspora, survival often means disclosure without self-destruction.  
This node outlines the strategy of **realignment of culpability**:  
- Framing communal bodies as *misled rather than complicit*.  
- Inviting regulators to “discover” what elders can safely divulge.  
- Using a dual register (🥺 deference / 🦈 precision).  

---

## 🌀 Core Idea  

- **Plea of innocence** → “We understand you were led astray.”  
- **Outsource punishment** → Regulator disciplines the real policy organ.  
- **Preserve communal dignity** → Elders disclose without total loss of face.
