*Individuals repeatedly caught in overlapping surveillance loops*

## ✨ Overview  

“Frequent flyers” are people whose names, selectors or profiles resurface again and again across different watch systems.  
They may have done nothing new — but each reappearance triggers new checks, new contractors, or a fresh escalation.  
The effect is a life lived under constant re-verification, with no single decision-maker to appeal to.  

---

## 🛰️ How It Happens  

- **Selector-driven flagging** — every new visa, bank account, travel plan or complaint hits the same database.  
- **Networked alerts** — multiple agencies or private contractors sharing “risk profiles” that self-replicate.  
- **Small staff pools** — the same handful of analysts handle the file repeatedly, each inheriting old notes.  
- **Risk aversion** — easier to re-open than to close.  
- **Bias** — gendered and racialised stereotypes (“manipulative”, “radicalised”, “difficult”) prime escalation.  

---

## 🌱 Impacts  

- Continuous sense of being watched without a single point of accountability.  
- Institutional memory of the person as “high maintenance” or “potential threat.”  
- Harder to get fair treatment because the file carries old assumptions.  
- Material harms: delayed visas, blocked bank accounts, “random” searches, reputational drag.  

---

## 🧰 Counter-Nudges  

- **File your own log** — keep a dated record of every contact, letter, and alert.  
- **Pattern discovery** — look for repeated contractors or reference numbers across seemingly unrelated incidents.  
- **Legal footing** — some jurisdictions allow access requests to see the selectors used.  
- **Collective naming** — turning an invisible experience into a visible category (“frequent flyers”) reframes it as a systemic issue.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🧿 🌀 🛰️ 🌱 — This node charts the recurring loops and selector triggers that trap individuals in overlapping surveillance systems and links it to practical counter-nudges.  
It echoes the endless bureaucracy of Kafka’s *The Trial*, the dystopian paper-chase of Gilliam’s *Brazil*, and the looping fate of *Groundhog Day* — showing how repetition itself becomes a form of punishment.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Frequent Flyers Club* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the structural reasons why some individuals are permanently recycled through surveillance systems, and the survivor-led tactics to make those loops visible.
