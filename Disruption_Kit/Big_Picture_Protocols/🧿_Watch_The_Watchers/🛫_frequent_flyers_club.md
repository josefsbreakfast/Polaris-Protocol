*Individuals repeatedly caught in overlapping surveillance loops*

---

## 🧭 Overview  

“Frequent flyers” are people whose names, selectors or profiles resurface repeatedly across different watch systems.  
They may have done nothing new — but each reappearance triggers new checks, new contractors, or a fresh escalation.

---

## 🌀 How It Happens  

- **Selector-driven flagging** — every new visa, bank account, travel plan or complaint hits the same database.  
- **Small staff pools** — the same handful of analysts handle the file again.  
- **Risk aversion** — easier to re-open than to close.  
- **Bias** — gendered and racialised stereotypes (“manipulative”, “radicalised”, “difficult”) prime escalation.

---

## 🌱 Impacts  

- Continuous sense of being watched without a single decision-maker.  
- Institutional memory of the person as “high maintenance” or “potential threat.”  
- Harder to get fair treatment because the file carries old assumptions.

It documents the structural reasons why some individuals are permanently recycled through surveillance systems.
