# 📜 Preventive Framework — UN Atrocity Indicators Applied to the UK Context
**First created:** 2025-10-08  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-09  
*Adapting the United Nations and Stanton atrocity-risk frameworks to a domestic lens—testing early-warning criteria within modern democratic systems.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

Genocide does not erupt from chaos; it is **administered through routine**.  
UN and academic early-warning models—Stanton’s “Ten Stages,” the UN Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes (2014), and the Office on Genocide Prevention’s Indicators—allow us to track that routine in advance.  

This node localises those frameworks to the UK context, mapping warning signals visible through economic policy, policing, digital governance, and public discourse.  

The goal is not prediction but **institutional calibration**: to see when the ordinary begins to tilt toward atrocity logic.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Localisation:** translating global indicators into domestic datasets.  
- **Continuum logic:** moving from prevention as reaction to prevention as culture.  
- **Integration:** connecting civic monitoring, journalism, and academia.  
- **Transparency:** exposing how secrecy and “risk language” obscure harm.  
- **Resilience metrics:** tracking counter-forces as well as warning signs.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1  Framework Adaptation  

| Global Criterion (UN / Stanton) | UK-Context Expression | Monitoring Metric |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------------|:------------------|
| **Discrimination & Dehumanisation** | “Benefit scrounger,” “illegal migrant,” “culture war” rhetoric | Media discourse analysis; Ofcom and IPSO complaints data |
| **Polarising Leadership** | Culture-war framing by ministers or MPs | Hansard frequency analysis; algorithmic trend mapping |
| **Militarisation & Surveillance Expansion** | Policing bills, border tech, data retention laws | Legislation tracking; procurement audits |
| **Targeted Harassment or Legal Isolation** | Protest restrictions, Prevent referrals, asylum exclusion | FOIA responses; Home Office data |
| **Impunity / Weak Justice** | Delays in hate-crime prosecution, under-reporting | CPS outcomes; victim-survey variance |
| **Propaganda & Misinformation** | Hostile environment narratives, digital astroturfing | Bot-network analysis; social-media API sampling |
| **Economic Inequality & Crisis** | Housing, food-bank use, health outcomes | ONS inequality index; Joseph Rowntree Foundation metrics |
| **Cultural Cleansing / Memory Erasure** | Curriculum revision, archive destruction, media control | Education policy review; library closures |
| **Early-Stage Violence** | Hate attacks, mosque / synagogue arson, refugee-housing fires | Police incident logs; civil-society mapping |
| **Denial / Revisionism** | Government resistance to inquiry or reparations | Parliamentary statements; press coverage trends |

### 2  Data Infrastructure for Prevention  
The UK lacks a joined-up national atrocity-monitoring unit.  
Instead, oversight fragments across watchdogs: EHRC, Ofcom, ICO, and the Charity Commission.  
A preventive framework requires **data interoperability**—a civic observatory that integrates public datasets, FOIA transparency, and survivor-witness data to map drift in real time.  

### 3  Risk Amplifiers in Contemporary Britain  
- **Algorithmic Policy Tools**: bias in welfare-risk scoring (e.g., disabled claimants).  
- **Media Concentration**: ownership consolidation reduces pluralism.  
- **Hostile Environment Architecture**: deterrence as moral logic.  
- **Public Fatigue**: crisis saturation leads to apathy, enabling normalisation.  

### 4  Counter-Indicators (Protective Forces)  
- Judicial independence and press freedom remain strong yet pressured.  
- Mutual-aid networks and community law centres act as early response units.  
- Digital archiving by NGOs prevents denial through documentation.  

### 5  Why “Domestic Atrocity Prevention” Matters  
The UK is rarely analysed as a potential site of atrocity risk, creating blind spots in global monitoring.  
But atrocity physics functions below the threshold of war: in asylum detention, social-care neglect, or digital dehumanisation.  
Recognising early drift enables **democratic self-repair**.

## ⚙️ UK Early-Warning Matrix (Condensed)  

| Domain | Early-Warning Signal | Evidence Base | Preventive Leverage |
|:-------|:--------------------|:--------------|:-------------------|
| **Law & Policy** | Expanding executive power / protest restriction | Public Order Act 2023 | Judicial review & rights education |
| **Economy** | Austerity targeting specific groups | ONS inequality / food-bank stats | Social-welfare reform advocacy |
| **Media** | Demonisation of minorities | Press / social-media monitoring | Ethical journalism & counter-narratives |
| **Tech** | Algorithmic profiling / censorship bias | Academic audits / whistle-blowers | Platform transparency legislation |
| **Culture** | “Woke” scapegoating / nationalism | Discourse analysis | Arts funding & civic dialogue |
| **Civic Space** | NGO defunding / protest bans | Charity & protest law review | Public-interest litigation |

## 🧠 Human Factor  

Prevention depends on empathy before evidence.  
When governance becomes adversarial, citizen vigilance must become relational.  
The task is not only to count risk factors but to **strengthen the moral reflex** that identifies dehumanisation when it begins.
