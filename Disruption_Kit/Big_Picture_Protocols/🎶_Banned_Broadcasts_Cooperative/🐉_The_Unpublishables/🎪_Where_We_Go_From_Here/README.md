The temptation to propose a first book as "My Struggle" with a byline that acts as a clear "fuck you" to any Hitler-loving bros is fairly strong an impulse for me, as I'm sure will be a great surprise to anyone familiar with my work.  

However, before we think about "lessons from 20 years spent being mined for my data, my body, and my soul by the alt-right" on an interpersonal level, I do rather think we need to concentrate on the act of actually fixing what mess they have started, here.  

Either book will require an actual proposal, and I think if you need libel cover, you may wish to speak to who has recently disclosed a move to the darkweb, rather than expecting a typical underwriter to sign off straightaway.  

I've put together a skeleton using my *definitly vanilla* little helper robot on ChatGPT.  

If you want it written, I would need an advance to cover some immediate relocation costs, a thorough exfoliation at a banya, and at least a week in an extremely quiet hotel away from the noise.  

I have already detailed security needs to relevent parties, so you could simply advocate to them directly ("Actually we would like to print, and we do need her to write, could you lessen her duress so it doesn't sound completely mad, please?").  

I also wouldn't mind some help taking the recycling out; I have mentioned this a few times.  

Can't get the staff these days, isn't it.  

Anyway. Here's a skeleton proposition; I'm open to editing *after* the week away from the hum and the buzz.
