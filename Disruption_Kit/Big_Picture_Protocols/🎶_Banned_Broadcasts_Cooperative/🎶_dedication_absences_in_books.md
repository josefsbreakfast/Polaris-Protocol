# 🎶 Dedication Absences in Books  
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Observation log of dedications and acknowledgments as metadata signals*  

---

## 📄 What Happened  
- Dedications/acknowledgments nearly universal across genres.  
- Some works omit them — a deliberate choice, or advised omission.  
- Legal/publisher advice sometimes discourages naming people.  

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- 80–90% of trade books include dedications/acknowledgments.  
- Common to dedicate to spouse, partner, or children (gendered patterns).  
- Technical/academic works sometimes skip dedications.  

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- Consistent absence of dedications across multiple authors.  
- Dedications cut during editing or proof.  
- Omission advised by legal counsel or publishers.  

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** Privacy; stylistic minimalism; fear of unprofessional tone.  
- **Containment:** Legal sanitisation; erasure of support networks; making author appear isolated.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🎶 📄 🧿 📚 — This node traces dedications as paratextual signals, where absence or erasure carries meaning beyond style.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *The Waste Land* (T.S. Eliot) — famously dedicated to Ezra Pound, shaping reception.  
- *Invisible Man* (Ralph Ellison) — paratext framing as a political marker.  
- *Beloved* (Toni Morrison) — “Sixty Million and more” as an invocation of erased lives.  

**Extended constellation (legal/historical):**  
- Publisher liability concerns — dedications cut for legal safety.  
- Defamation and libel risks cited by editorial boards.  
- Case law: *Cassidy v Daily Mirror* (1929) — precedent on reputational harm from implication.

*🎶 Dedication Absences in Books* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It frames dedications as cultural metadata: inclusion signals labour’s social cost, while omission signals restraint or containment.
