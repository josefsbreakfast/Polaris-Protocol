*Observation log of dedications and acknowledgments as metadata signals.*

---

## 📄 What Happened  
- Dedications/acknowledgments nearly universal across genres.  
- Some works omit them — a deliberate choice, or advised omission.  
- Legal/publisher advice sometimes discourages naming people.

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- 80–90% of trade books include dedications/acknowledgments.  
- Common to dedicate to spouse, partner, or children (gendered patterns).  
- Technical/academic works sometimes skip dedications.

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- Consistent absence of dedications across multiple authors.  
- Dedications cut during editing or proof.  
- Omission advised by legal counsel or publishers.

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** Privacy; stylistic minimalism; fear of unprofessional tone.  
- **Containment:** Legal sanitisation; erasure of support networks; making author appear isolated.

This log frames dedications as cultural metadata.  
Inclusion signals labour’s social cost; omission signals restraint or containment.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
