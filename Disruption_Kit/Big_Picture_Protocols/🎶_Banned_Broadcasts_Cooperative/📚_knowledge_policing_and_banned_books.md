*DIY manuals treated as subversive while extremist arsenals slide through unremarked*

## 1. Blair-Era Bans

* In the 2000s, UK authorities banned certain anarchist or counterculture texts to balance prosecutions of jihadist literature.
* Targets included: *Recipes for Disaster*, *Annika’s Cookbook*, and other DIY handbooks.
* Content was mundane: wallpaper paste recipes, community cooking, banner painting, bike repair, lock-on tactics.
* In effect, the state criminalised **arts and crafts for grown-ups** — not insurrection.

## 2. Why Ban Them?

* These manuals embarrassed police when protesters deployed low-level disruption (going floppy, refusing cooperation).
* They lowered the barrier of entry for ordinary people to join protest by making tactics accessible.
* The ban was about containment optics, not safety: preventing legitimacy erosion, not preventing harm.

## 3. Contrast with the Far Right

* **Under-policing.** Fascist groups with literal rooms full of machetes or firearms were often dismissed as “boys with toys” until lethal.
* **Over-policing.** Leftists with books about cooking paste were raided and prosecuted.
* **Bias.** Left = dangerous early. Right = tolerated late. The asymmetry reveals the racialised and hierarchical logic of policing.

## 4. Knowledge as Contraband

* DIY manuals were treated like weapons because they enabled independent organisation.
* Suppression of knowledge is suppression of legitimacy: communities capable of self-governance threaten state optics.
* Books become contraband when they teach cooperation, not destruction.

## 🏮 Footer

*Knowledge Policing and Banned Books* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.
It documents how states criminalise DIY manuals while ignoring extremist arsenals, revealing suppression as a matter of optics and legitimacy rather than danger.
