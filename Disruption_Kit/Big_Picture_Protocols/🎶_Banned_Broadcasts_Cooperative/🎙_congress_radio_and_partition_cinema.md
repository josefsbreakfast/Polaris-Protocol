*Clandestine broadcasts of the Quit India movement and their cinematic afterlives*

---

## 1. Congress Radio (1942)

* Founded by **Usha Mehta** during the Quit India movement.
* Broadcasts carried news of resistance, solidarity, and anticolonial struggle.
* Operated in secrecy: transmitters moved constantly, signal hidden from British authorities.
* Functioned as an outlaw public: communities hearing themselves outside colonial control.

---

## 2. Coalitions and Conflicts

* **INC (Congress)**: led the Quit India campaign.
* **Khudai Khidmatgar**: Pashtun non-violence movement under Abdul Ghaffar Khan, allied.
* **Praja Mandals**: organised in princely states.
* **Bolshevik–Leninist Party**: sympathetic but marginal.
* **Muslim League**: opposed Quit India, prioritising partition.
* **Hindu Mahasabha**: opposed.
* **CPI (Communist Party of India)**: withheld support, aligning with USSR/Britain wartime strategy.

## 3. Cinema as Counter-Memory

* *Ae Watan Mere Watan* (2024) retold Usha Mehta’s story for a diaspora audience.
* Serves as resistance to Modi-era nationalist rewriting of partition history.
* Emphasises **unity across communities** pre-partition — a counterpoint to current divisive rhetoric.

---

## 4. Partition and the Sound of Independence

* Congress Radio symbolises how **unauthorised broadcasts carry legitimacy** when official channels collapse into propaganda.
* Its memory lives less in state commemoration than in film, oral history, and diaspora retellings.
* The struggle was not only territorial but sonic: who had the right to transmit India’s future.
