**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Observation log of hostile review dynamics around the author’s pre-2022 book.*

---

## 📄 What Happened  
- Long-form “book review” in an international relations journal (2018).  
- Reviewer: **REDACTED** (generic name, no visible other publications).  
- Hostile and vague: dismisses policy ideas as “too left-wing” without naming specifics.  
- Indexed on JSTOR, appeared like a peer-reviewed article.  
- **Unusually open access** on JSTOR (Sept 2025).  
- Ranked on **page 1** of Google when searching for 2022 book last week.  
- Now buried to **page 4**, even with targeted terms.

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- Academic book reviews exist in journals.  
- JSTOR indexing of older reviews is routine.  
- Some journals make reviews freely available.

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- 2018 review surfaced as *top* result for unrelated 2022 book.  
- Generic reviewer with no traceable scholarly record.  
- Review functioning as “article-like” ideological dismissal with no specifics.  
- Temporary visibility boost, then burial.

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** JSTOR metadata tweak; Google algorithm shifts; journal policy on open reviews.  
- **Containment:** Deliberate SEO boost to intercept searches; hostile framing to cap reception; opaque reviewer identity.

It captures how hostile reviews can function as **containment anchors**, shaping cursory impressions and discouraging deeper engagement.
