# 🎶 Containment by Review — JSTOR (2018)  
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Observation log of hostile review dynamics around the author’s pre-2022 book.*  

---

## 📄 What Happened  
- Long-form “book review” in an international relations journal (2018).  
- Reviewer: **REDACTED** (generic name, no visible other publications).  
- Hostile and vague: dismisses policy ideas as “too left-wing” without naming specifics.  
- Indexed on JSTOR, appeared like a peer-reviewed article.  
- **Unusually open access** on JSTOR (Sept 2025).  
- Ranked on **page 1** of Google when searching for 2022 book last week.  
- Now buried to **page 4**, even with targeted terms.  

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- Academic book reviews exist in journals.  
- JSTOR indexing of older reviews is routine.  
- Some journals make reviews freely available.  

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- 2018 review surfaced as *top* result for unrelated 2022 book.  
- Generic reviewer with no traceable scholarly record.  
- Review functioning as “article-like” ideological dismissal with no specifics.  
- Temporary visibility boost, then burial.  

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** JSTOR metadata tweak; Google algorithm shifts; journal policy on open reviews.  
- **Containment:** Deliberate SEO boost to intercept searches; hostile framing to cap reception; opaque reviewer identity.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🎶 🔍 🧾 🧿 — This node sits in the metadata suppression layer, showing how “reviews” become containment anchors in digital circulation.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *Fahrenheit 451* (François Truffaut, 1966) — official dismissal of outlawed knowledge.  
- *The Name of the Rose* (Umberto Eco) — hostile curation of knowledge in monastic archives.  
- *Disgrace* (J.M. Coetzee) — reputation and perception eclipsing substance.  

**Extended constellation (legal/technical):**  
- Academic indexing databases (JSTOR, Scopus) — metadata structuring access.  
- *Google Spain v AEPD* (2014) — search results as reputational control.  
- UK Defamation Act 2013 — hostile reviews and the boundary of opinion vs injury.
