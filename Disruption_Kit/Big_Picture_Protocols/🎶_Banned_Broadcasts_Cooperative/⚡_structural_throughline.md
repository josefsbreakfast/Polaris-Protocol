*Synthesis: containment strikes at legitimacy, not danger*  

---

## ✨ Summary  
Containment has a pattern: it rarely targets actual danger, but instead polices legitimacy. From pirate radio to banned books to testimony suppression, what gets silenced are the transmissions that threaten appearances of control. This node traces that throughline, showing how suppression cycles repeat across media, memory, and survivor voice.

## 🛰️ 1. The Pattern  
Across outlaw sound, banned books, feed manipulation, and testimony suppression, the same structure repeats:  

- **Containment is never about safety.**  
- **Containment is always about legitimacy.**  

Pirate FM never downed planes. DIY manuals never toppled states. Testimonies never endangered the public. But each threatened the *appearance of control*.

## 📿 2. The Cycle  
1. **Suppression.** Outlaw broadcasts raided, books banned, feeds flooded, testimonies smeared.  
2. **Erasure.** Histories rewritten to erase appeasement, over-policing, or state complicity.  
3. **Co-option.** Once unavoidable, outlaw forms are licensed, sanitised, or absorbed.  
4. **Rebranding.** The state declares itself protector of the very freedoms it crushed.

## 🎏 3. Double Standards  
- **Left / marginal.** Criminalised early, suppressed when legitimacy feels fragile.  
- **Right / fascist.** Tolerated until undeniable violence, then reframed as aberration.  
- **Black / working-class culture.** Over-policed as deviant.  
- **White extremist culture.** Under-policed as “boys with toys.”  

---

## 🪄 4. Memory Rewrites  
- WWII Britain: “we fought fascism” overwrites appeasement and antisemitism.  
- Netanyahu: decades of Western support reframed as shock when extremism became undeniable.  
- Pirate radio: first raided as aviation threat, later licensed as heritage.  
- Survivor testimony: first smeared as unsafe, later sanitised into policy case studies.

## 🦇 5. Throughline  
The fight is always about **who gets to transmit**.  

- Pirate FM and sofa parties.  
- Anarchist cookbooks and samizdat manuals.  
- Usha Mehta’s clandestine broadcasts.  
- Survivors mapping torture and misattribution.  

Suppression does not follow danger. It follows threat to legitimacy.
