# 📂 Banned Broadcasts Cooperative — Data & Analysis  

**First created:** 2025-09-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-23  
*Structured evidence, datasets, and analytic notes underpinning muted and banned media cases.*

## Scope  

This subfolder contains **datasets, scripts, and analytic nodes** that support the broader *Banned Broadcasts Cooperative*.  
Where the main cluster traces cultural and political suppression, these files preserve **empirical trails**: CSV catalogues, parsing code, and transparency analyses.  

The aim is twofold:  
1. To **preserve raw data** that institutions may later erase.  
2. To **equip investigators** with reproducible methods to test suppression hypotheses.

## Frame  

This folder is a **forensic appendix** to the Cooperative.  
It captures the numbers and traces behind muted culture — proof that suppression can be measured, not just felt.
