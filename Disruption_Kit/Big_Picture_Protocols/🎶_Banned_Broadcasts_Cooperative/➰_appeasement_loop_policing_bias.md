# ➰ Appeasement Loop Policing Bias

*Why leftist groups are over-policed while fascists slide through with appeasement*

## 1. Unequal Policing in Practice

* **Leftist protest.** Squatters, climate activists, anti-racists: raided, kettled, pre-emptively criminalised. “Go floppy” tactics still end in mass arrests.
* **Far-right protest.** Glassings, machetes, firearms: often treated with kid gloves. Police frame them as “public order challenges,” not existential threats.
* **Prevent strategy.** Over-targets Muslim, left, and marginal protest movements; under-targets violent white extremism until denial is impossible.

## 2. The Liberal Mistake

Liberals often believe that fascists can be managed, bargained with, or “appeased.” This creates an **appeasement loop**:

1. Fascist emerges.
2. Liberals insist: “they’re manageable.”
3. Enable or appease extremist.
4. Extremism escalates.
5. Liberal shock: “we never liked him.”
6. Historical rewrite: “we fought for freedom.”

## 3. Contemporary Parallels

* **Netanyahu.** Western governments used him as a bulldog for decades, enabling settlements and brutality. Now that his extremism is undeniable, they perform shock. Same playbook as post-1945 Britain: “we fought fascism,” while ignoring appeasement and embedded antisemitism.
* **UK far right.** Groups tolerated until too violent to ignore; then reframed as aberrations, never as products of state leniency.

## 4. Containment Logic

* **Left = early criminalisation.** Because left protest threatens legitimacy optics (exposes hypocrisy, reveals fragility of state narratives).
* **Right = delayed response.** Because far-right violence affirms hierarchy and racial order; it is tolerated until it becomes embarrassing.
* **Appeasement as governance.** The loop is not failure but a deliberate strategy: by appeasing the right and crushing the left, legitimacy appears centred and “reasonable.”

*Appeasement Loop Policing Bias* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.
It documents how liberal states appease far-right extremism while over-policing leftist resistance, using denial and historical revision as cover.
