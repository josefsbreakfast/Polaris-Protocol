# 🎬 Suppression Legends Film Index  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*Films that became cultural detonators precisely because someone tried to mute them.*

## 🎞️ Concept  

This node gathers films whose **suppression became the story** — works that gained longevity, reverence, or cult status because they were censored, banned, pulled, or buried.  

Some were targeted for political messaging. Others became inconvenient in retrospect. All survived because audiences *refused to forget them*.

*Suppression Legends Film Index* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It collates cinematic works that became amplified by attempts to silence them,  
and supports broader diagnostics of narrative control across media formats.
