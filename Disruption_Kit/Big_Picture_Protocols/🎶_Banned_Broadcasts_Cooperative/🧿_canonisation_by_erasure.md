# 🧿 Canonisation by Erasure

*When a work is buried, it becomes holy*  

---

## ✨ Introduction  
When a book vanishes, it rarely disappears.  
Instead, absence consecrates it. The forbidden becomes sacred, the buried becomes myth.  

Across history, bans, metadata sabotage, lawsuits, or quiet burial have repeatedly produced the opposite of their intent. What was meant to vanish becomes central. What was denied becomes desired.  

This is the paradox of **canon by erasure**: suppression itself writes the book into memory.

## 🧬 Concept  
Attempts to suppress a work — through bans, metadata sabotage, lawsuits, or erasure — often backfire.  

- Banned books become bestsellers.  
- Censored songs become anthems.  
- Blacklisted texts are studied in whispers — then in seminar rooms.  

Canon-by-erasure is not accidental.  
It is a **narrative consequence** of systemic overreach and reader defiance.  

---

## 🧠 Key Dynamics  
- **Loss as consecration** — disappearance signals deeper truth.  
- **Access as resistance** — scarcity becomes a challenge to solve.  
- **Myth formation** — the story of censorship becomes part of the canon’s appeal.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🧿 🔥 📜 👁️ 🎬 — This node belongs to the suppression paradox constellation,  
tracking how buried works surface not in spite of suppression, but *because of it*.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *Doctor Zhivago* (Pasternak) — suppressed in the USSR, weaponised abroad, immortalised.  
- *Fahrenheit 451* (Bradbury) — fiction turned into metaphor of erasure.  
- *Maus* (Art Spiegelman) — banned in schools, canonised through backlash.  
- *La Haine* (Kassovitz) — censorship threat turned into enduring cult film.  

**Extended constellation (legal/technical):**  
- Samizdat networks (Soviet Union) — scarcity as consecration.  
- U.S. Comstock Laws — “obscene” texts canonised by prohibition.  
- Metadata sabotage — erasure loops creating prestige through difficulty of access.

*🧿 Canonisation by Erasure* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the inverse effect of suppression: how attempted silencing guarantees a legacy  
through curiosity, resistance, and memory.
