# 🧿 Canonisation by Erasure  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*When a work is buried, it becomes holy.*

## 🧬 Concept  

Attempts to suppress a work — through bans, metadata sabotage, lawsuits, or quiet burial — often backfire.  
What vanishes becomes *precious*. What’s denied becomes *desired*.  
This is the architecture of **canon by erasure**:  

- Banned books become bestsellers.  
- Censored songs become anthems.  
- Blacklisted texts are studied in whispers — then in seminar rooms.  

Canon-by-erasure is not accidental.  
It is a **narrative consequence** of systemic overreach and reader defiance.

---

## 🧠 Key Dynamics  

- **Loss as consecration** — disappearance signals deeper truth.  
- **Access as resistance** — scarcity becomes a challenge to solve.  
- **Myth formation** — the story of censorship becomes part of the canon’s appeal.

*Canonisation by Erasure* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the inverse effect of suppression: how attempted silencing guarantees a legacy  
through curiosity, resistance, and memory.
