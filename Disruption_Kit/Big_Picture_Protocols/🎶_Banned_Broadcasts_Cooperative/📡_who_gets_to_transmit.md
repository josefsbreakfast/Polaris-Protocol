# 📡 Who Gets to Transmit

## Thesis

Every struggle over media — from pirate FM to banned books, from survivor testimony to algorithmic feeds — is really a struggle over **who gets to transmit**.

Containment is never neutral. It does not target what is *most dangerous*. It clamps down on what is *least tolerable to legitimacy*.

* **Black and working-class sound cultures**: hyper-policed, raided, criminalised.
* **White extremist sound cultures**: tolerated, discoverable, often under-policed.
* **DIY manuals**: banned as dangerous when in leftist hands.
* **Weapons stockpiles**: dismissed as “boys with toys” until lethal.
* **Survivor testimony**: misattributed and smeared.
* **Corporate media feeds**: flooded with distraction instead of silence.

Across time and geography, the same pattern holds: suppression is not proportional to harm. It is proportional to the threat a signal poses to existing hierarchies.

## Framing

This constellation gathers nodes across outlaw sound, banned texts, appeasement bias, and testimony suppression. Each is an instance of the same logic:

* **Not safety.** Pirate FM never downed a plane. DIY manuals never toppled governments.
* **Legitimacy.** What states cannot tolerate is unauthorised publics, independent knowledge, autonomous speech.

From Brixton sofa parties to Congress Radio, from algorithmic pastel floods to WWII appeasement mythologies: *the question is always who is allowed to transmit, and who must be silenced.*

*Who Gets to Transmit* is a constellation node of the Polaris Protocol.
It anchors the **Banned Broadcasts Cooperative**, mapping how states and corporations criminalise, ban, or flood transmissions that challenge their legitimacy.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
