# 🎧 Media Visibility Gap Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-10-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-01  
*Audit method for suppressed films, albums, podcasts, and broadcast media.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

This protocol extends the **suppression audit model** from books to **media objects**.  
It quantifies visibility gaps between announced or screened works (festival premiere, playlist inclusion, press coverage) and actual public access (distribution, streaming, purchase).  

## 🔧 Key audit vectors  

- **Films:** festival catalogue vs. theatrical release vs. VOD availability  
- **Albums:** label announcement vs. streaming playlist presence vs. retail availability  
- **Podcasts:** feed indexing vs. platform takedown vs. search ranking  
- **Broadcasts:** announced programming vs. actual airing vs. archive availability  

## 📊 Metrics  

- **Festival-to-distribution gap** (films)  
- **Playlist-to-discovery gap** (albums, podcasts)  
- **Streaming attrition** (works announced but later pulled or geoblocked)  
- **Metadata erosion** (searches yield unofficial uploads or irrelevant results)
