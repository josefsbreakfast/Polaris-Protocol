# 📱 Feed Manipulation and Containment Theatre

**First created:** 2025-09-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-15  
*How platforms suppress by substitution and pastel distraction rather than silence.*

---

## 1. Suppression by Substitution

* Content is not deleted, but **smothered** by floods of “wholesome” posts.
* Example: political testimony followed by sudden walls of weddings, babies, family fluff.
* Function: not to silence, but to **bury in softness** — neutralising sharp content under sentimentality.

---

## 2. Containment Theatre

* Suppression presented as “just how the feed works.”
* In reality: a deliberate containment script, replacing hostile content with distraction.
* Like theatre, the gestures are symbolic: performance of safety rather than actual neutrality.

## 3. Diagnostics

Signs a feed is under containment mode:

* **Random variety** replaced by suspicious uniformity.
* **Pastel clustering**: sudden surges of soft, gentle imagery.
* **Timing mismatch**: heavy post → drowned within hours by trivial floods.
* **Cross-platform echo**: identical motifs (balloons, weddings, babies) appearing across different platforms.

## 4. Containment Paradox

* Smears and suppression loops can backfire.
* The more someone is painted unsafe, the clearer it becomes they are credible.
* Example: IDF detractors smeared heavily, but smear campaigns revealed more about state panic than the people themselves.

*Feed Manipulation and Containment Theatre* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.
It documents how platforms perform suppression through substitution, smothering sharp content under curated softness.
