*How survivor testimony is smeared, misattributed, and inverted into containment*

---

## 1. Testimony Under Attack

* Survivors of war crimes and torture often face targeted suppression.
* Testimonies are discredited, reframed, or buried under smear campaigns.
* Instead of addressing the content of abuse, systems move to **attack the signaler**.

---

## 2. Data Twin Misattribution

* Survivor reports of harassment by one individual were misattributed to another (“data twin”).
* Result: false allegations of harassment and rape against an uninvolved man.
* Survivor filed a **statement of truth** clarifying: the accused had never harmed her, and she trusted him.
* Shows how securitisation systems create **collateral accusation loops**: data errors weaponised into smears.

---

## 3. Containment Inversion

* The harder smear campaigns tried to paint the “data twin” as unsafe, the clearer it became that he was trustworthy.
* Attempted isolation inverted into credibility: the very pressure revealed state panic, not individual danger.
* Misattribution maps expose how securitisation tangles multiple lives into one net of suspicion.

---

## 4. War, Torture, and Legitimacy

* Testimony of psychological torture and physical interference was repeatedly dismissed as exaggeration or misidentification.
* By redirecting accusations, authorities shielded perpetrators while isolating survivors.
* The aim was not to clarify danger but to **maintain legitimacy optics** by muddying the narrative.

*Narrative Misattribution and War Testimony* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.
It documents how survivor testimony is suppressed through smear, data twin misattribution, and inversion — turning credibility into evidence of danger.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
