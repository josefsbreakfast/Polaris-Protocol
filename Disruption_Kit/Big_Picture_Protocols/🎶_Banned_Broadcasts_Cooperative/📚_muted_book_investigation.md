- One-page summary  
- Screenshots  
- WorldCat CSV  
- Review timeline  
- Suspicion score  
- Originals held back, sharable under NDA

## üì¢ 8) Public presentation (safe practices)  
- Use redacted identifiers in public notes.  
- Publish methodology + public evidence, not raw private data.  
- Share originals only under NDA with journalists/solicitors.  
- Avoid naming unverified actors; focus on pattern + evidence.

## ‚úÖ 9) Quick checklist for field investigators  
- [ ] Save .eml + headers  
- [ ] Screenshot publisher + Amazon  
- [ ] Archive on Wayback  
- [ ] Record WorldCat holdings  
- [ ] Search mainstream reviews  
- [ ] Pull distributor metadata  
- [ ] Compile review timeline  
- [ ] Compute suspicion score  
- [ ] Draft neutral inquiry  
- [ ] If score ‚â•4, package journalist + legal bundle

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 10) Interpretation & pitfalls  
- Not every low-visibility title is suppressed ‚Äî small press = low reach.  
- Middleman cascades can mimic coordination.  
- Timing matters (delayed reviews or paperback).  
- Keep methodology forensic, not rhetorical.

## ‚è≥ 11) Closing notes ‚Äî limits  
This protocol diagnoses *what happened* (publication + visibility).  
It does not alone establish *motive or beneficiary*. That requires power-mapping.  
Sometimes suppression stems from trivial or spurious triggers that cascade.  

Treat this protocol as a **forensic baseline**.

## üåå Constellations  

üìö üîç üìù ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Äî This node belongs to the forensic diagnostics constellation, mapping suppression at the level of bibliographic traces and visibility shifts.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *Fahrenheit 451* (Ray Bradbury) ‚Äî erasure through invisibility.  
- *The Book of Laughter and Forgetting* (Milan Kundera) ‚Äî histories vanish through silence.  
- *The Trial* (Franz Kafka) ‚Äî bureaucratic disappearance as punishment.  

**Extended constellation (legal/technical):**  
- UK Defamation Act 2013 ‚Äî hostile reviews and suppression crossover.  
- Metadata standards (Nielsen, ISBN registries) ‚Äî choke points in discoverability.  
- Case law on takedowns and visibility suppression (e.g. *Google Spain v AEPD*, 2014).

*üìö Muted Book Investigation* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a replicable methodology for diagnosing whether a book‚Äôs low visibility is natural or engineered.
