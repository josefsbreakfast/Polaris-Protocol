*Not every silencing is illegal. Some are precisely lawful.*

## ⚖️ Concept  

The modern state rarely says: *you can't speak.*  
Instead, it says: *you’re out of contract.* *You’re off curriculum.* *You breached terms.*  

This node tracks how **censorship is laundered through legality** — how laws, public order clauses, or funding policies become speech filters:

- **Anti-BDS pledges** embedded in state contracts  
- **Curriculum bans** on “divisive concepts” in schools  
- **Defamation chill** — lawsuits designed to deter publication  
- **Public order acts** used to arrest protestors or shut down press events  
- **Foreign agent laws** used to silence NGOs and academics

It is censorship by **statute**, not stigma.

## 🗂 Notable Mechanisms  

- **Contractual suppression** — e.g. *Boycott (2022)*  
- **Curriculum control** — banned texts in schools  
- **Libel laws** — weaponised to bankrupt dissent  
- **NGO registration regimes** — cutting off dissent via paperwork  
- **Regulatory risk** — vague laws used as chilling effect

*Statutory Censorship Logics* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the legal mechanisms by which speech is curtailed through contracts, policies, and legislative traps —  
and how “freedom” is filtered at the level of compliance.
