**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Observation log of foreword writers, blurbers, and endorsers tied to the book.*

---

## 📄 What Happened  
- Senior professionals wrote blurbs, forewords, or were quoted endorsing.  
- These figures usually enjoy prestige and protection.  
- Suppression of the book raises questions: were endorsers also pressured or sidelined?

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- Endorsers benefit from association.  
- Blurbs increase visibility, not risk.  
- Careers unaffected in most cases.

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- Endorsers later lose positions, grants, or visibility.  
- Endorsers pivot away from related fields.  
- Endorsers downplay their past connection.

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** Coincidental career shifts; normal turnover.  
- **Containment:** Soft pressure on endorsers; reputational chilling; discouraging future associations.
