*Observation log of sudden visibility changes for the 2022 book.*

---

## 📄 What Happened  
- Within one week, search results shifted:  
  - **Before:** hostile JSTOR 2018 review on page 1.  
  - **Now:** book itself appears “fine” on Google; hostile review buried to page 4.  
- A **REDACTED Think Tank** lists the book with the **wrong year** in bios/policy papers.

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- Rankings fluctuate as new material appears.  
- SEO updates weekly.  
- Institutions occasionally misdate publications.

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- Narrow search terms no longer return the once-prominent review.  
- Misdating replicated in external summaries, potentially breaking citation trails.  
- Sharp discoverability change in under 7 days.

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** Algorithm refresh; publisher metadata updates; fresh online mentions.  
- **Containment:** Initial boosting of hostile review, later burial; misdating to disrupt indexing; narrative reshaping post-release.
