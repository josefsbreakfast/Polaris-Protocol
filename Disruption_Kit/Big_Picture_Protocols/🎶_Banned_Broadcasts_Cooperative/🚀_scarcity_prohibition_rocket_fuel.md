# 🚀 Scarcity + Prohibition = Rocket Fuel

*Why attempts to withhold books amplify demand instead of suppressing it.*

## 🌱 Why It Works  
- **Curiosity drive:** readers want to know *what was so bad* it got hidden.  
- **Moral framing:** buying becomes resistance. *“If it’s suppressed, owning it is a stand.”*  
- **Status economy:** possession = social capital. Owning the “banned” book confers insider prestige.  
- **Self-perpetuating loop:** gossip spreads scarcity; scarcity amplifies gossip.

## 📚 Case Studies  
- **D.H. Lawrence, *Lady Chatterley’s Lover*** (UK obscenity trial, 1960): prosecution ensured mass readership.  
- **James Joyce, *Ulysses*** (banned in US/UK until 1930s): censorship made it legendary.  
- **Salman Rushdie, *The Satanic Verses*** (1989): global controversy turned into huge sales.  
- **Samizdat in the USSR**: underground duplication of banned texts created prestige economies.  
- **Modern US school/library bans**: recent waves have consistently driven challenged books (e.g. *Maus*, *Gender Queer*) up bestseller charts.

## 🔎 Protocol Relevance  
Suppression (real or perceived) isn’t a brake — it’s an accelerant.  
Every attempt to throttle access creates the conditions for wildfire spread.  

✨ **Takeaway:** In literary ecosystems, “you mustn’t” is the most reliable marketing line ever written.

*Scarcity + Prohibition = Rocket Fuel* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how scarcity and suppression generate demand, amplifying the very texts meant to be contained.
