*A viral impersonator who punctured strongman mythologies with humour, bridging Chinese and global audiences.*

## Summary  
Chen Rui (English name Ryan), an English teacher and online content creator from Chongqing, went globally viral for his uncanny impersonations of Donald Trump. His work demonstrates how parody can bypass propaganda filters, dissolve prejudice, and connect audiences across hostile systems.  

---

## What He Does  
- Mimics Donald Trump’s cadence, hand gestures, voice inflection and hyperbolic phrasing with uncanny accuracy.  
- Delivers parody skits in both English and Chinese, often using everyday settings (streets, lunch breaks, McDonald’s).  
- Doubles the parody as language-learning material, giving plausible deniability on Chinese platforms.  
- Provides global audiences with a mirror: the archetypal strongman exposed as absurd through the voice of “Chinese Trump.”  

---

## Why It Resonated Cross-Culturally  
- **Entry through prejudice:** Western audiences primed to laugh at “Chinese parody” instead laughed *with* it — because it nailed Trump better than American comedians. The parody exposed xenophobic assumptions by inverting them.  
- **Safe proxy for Chinese audiences:** Trump was the butt of the joke, but parallels to domestic strongmen were obvious. Viewers could laugh at power without overtly crossing red lines.  
- **Universality of Trump as caricature:** Everyone recognised the absurd exaggerations (“tariffs,” “the deal,” “I get nine slices, you get one”). The parody transcended borders.  

---

## Cultural Shockwave  
- **Broke the DEI filter:** It wasn’t about representation or diversity — it was simply funny. That forced Western audiences who rarely engaged with Chinese media to engage on comic terms.  
- **Dissolved propaganda lines:** Clips spread peer-to-peer on TikTok, bypassing official narratives in both China and the US.  
- **Spooked policymakers:** The virality embodied exactly what Western governments feared about TikTok — uncontrolled humour undermining domestic authority. Chen Rui wasn’t *the cause* of bans, but he symbolised the uncontrollable cultural convergence.

## Why He Belongs in the Banned Books Cooperative  
- Like samizdat texts, Chen Rui’s clips carried truths across firewalls.  
- They offered satire where overt critique wasn’t possible.  
- They travelled peer-to-peer, in spirit identical to banned literature and underground theatre.  
- They showed that performance can be a resistant text.

## Analytical Note  
Chen Rui’s parody works because it punctures two myths at once:  
1. That authoritarian or populist leaders project strength — when in fact they are ridiculous.  
2. That only Western voices can parody Western power — when in fact parody is a universal weapon.  

By exploiting existing prejudice as an entry point, he flipped the script: the joke was on Trump, but also on Western audiences who didn’t expect a Chinese creator to nail it. That double punchline is what made the work historic.
