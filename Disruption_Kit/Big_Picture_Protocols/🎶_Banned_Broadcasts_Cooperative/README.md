# 🎶 Banned Broadcasts Cooperative  

**First created:** 2025-09-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*A cooperative archive of outlaw sound, banned books, and suppressed signals*  

---

## Scope  

The **Banned Broadcasts Cooperative (BBC)** gathers nodes where music, radio, print, and feeds have been policed, raided, or throttled into silence.  

From pirate FM transmitters on London tower blocks to Blair-era banned cookbooks, from Usha Mehta’s *Congress Radio* during the Quit India movement to algorithmic feed floods on Instagram — each entry shows how states and corporations try to throttle culture whenever legitimacy feels threatened.  

This folder exists to track not only the suppression but the **resistance architectures** that emerge: sofa parties turned into sound systems, samizdat pamphlets passed hand to hand, community broadcasters refusing permission.

## Frame  

This cooperative is not a neutral archive. It is contraband archiving.  

It documents the suppression of community transmission — and the ways those signals always find another frequency.
