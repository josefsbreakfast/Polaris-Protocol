**First created:** 2025-09-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-15
*A cooperative archive of outlaw sound, banned books, and suppressed signals.*

## Scope

The **Banned Broadcasts Cooperative (BBC)** gathers nodes where music, radio, print, and feeds have been policed, raided, or throttled into silence.

From pirate FM transmitters on London tower blocks to Blair-era banned cookbooks, from Usha Mehta’s *Congress Radio* during the Quit India movement to algorithmic feed floods on Instagram — each entry shows how states and corporations try to throttle culture whenever legitimacy feels threatened.

This folder exists to track not only the suppression but the **resistance architectures** that emerge: sofa parties turned into sound systems, samizdat pamphlets passed hand to hand, community broadcasters refusing permission.

## Contents (planned)

* `📡_who_gets_to_transmit.md` — constellation thesis: containment is never about safety, it’s about legitimacy.
* `🎶_pirate_radio_as_policed_resistance.md` — tower blocks as transmitters, raids as governance theatre.
* `➰_appeasement_loop_policing_bias.md` — why leftist groups are over-policed while fascists slide.
* `📚_knowledge_policing_and_banned_books.md` — DIY manuals as “dangerous” while machetes circulate freely.
* `📱_feed_manipulation_and_containment_theatre.md` — algorithmic suppression through substitution and pastel floods.
* `🎙_congress_radio_and_partition_cinema.md` — clandestine signals of the Quit India movement, and their cinematic memory.
* `🕳_narrative_misattribution_and_war_testimony.md` — misattributed testimony and data twins as containment.
* `🌀_structural_throughline.md` — synthesis of the pattern: containment hits legitimacy, not danger.

## Frame

This cooperative is not a neutral archive. It is contraband archiving.

It documents the suppression of community transmission — and the ways those signals always find another frequency.
