## 🎶 Concept  

Music moves differently. It hides on mixtapes, spreads in DMs, loops in heads.  
Even under total surveillance, it finds a way.  

This node tracks **audio suppression and musical leakback** — how banned tracks become transmission vectors:  
- Played in kitchens.  
- Sampled anonymously.  
- Whispered across Bluetooth, burned to CD-Rs, or embedded in memes.

Where speech is throttled, **sound becomes code**.

## 🧾 Examples  

- *Searching for Sugar Man* — Rodríguez bootlegged through apartheid South Africa  
- *Fela Kuti* — raided, banned, yet omnipresent in 70s Nigeria  
- *Gil Scott-Heron* — surveilled, blocked from radio, but quoted in resistance movements  
- TikTok erasure cycles — activist songs removed, re-uploaded, remixed as bait  
- Iranian underground rock — distributed via encrypted USB chains  
- Palestinian tracks flagged as “hate content” by Western platforms

## 🌌 Constellations  

🎧 🔥 🧿 🕸️ 🛰️ — This node belongs to the peer-to-peer resistance layer of Polaris.  
It maps **musical payloads as semantic smuggling**,  
and the way sound leaks past containment walls.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Banned Tracks Transmission Loops* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces the architecture of sonic suppression and how music — more than text — resists metadata throttling.
