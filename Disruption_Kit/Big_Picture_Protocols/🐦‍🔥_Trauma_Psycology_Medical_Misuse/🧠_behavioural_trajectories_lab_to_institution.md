# 🧠 Behavioural Trajectories — From Lab to Institution  
**First created:** 2025-09-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Tracing how operant and behavioural research in UK universities shifted from controlled experiments to applied institutional settings*  

---

## 🎓 Premise  

Between 2005–2010, behavioural psychology in the UK was still heavily grounded in **operant and associative learning paradigms**: rodent lever-presses, latent inhibition, conditioned responses, and cognitive modelling in controlled labs.  

Over the last 10–15 years, several universities — Nottingham, Sheffield, Manchester — have **migrated these methods into applied institutional contexts**, where behaviour is no longer isolated in a box but embedded in hospitals, classrooms, workplaces, or policy environments.  

This node collects concrete before/after traces showing that migration.

## 🏛 University: Example 001  

**Earlier (pre-2010)**  
-Example lab 001: **latent inhibition, trace conditioning, rodent associative learning**.  
- Focus on mechanistic experiments: attention, associative learning, dopamine manipulations.  

**Later (2015–2025)**  
- Translation of those paradigms to **psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction** (schizophrenia, ADHD, Tourette’s).  
- Behavioural methods extended to **human usability, health psychology, ergonomics** in the Centre for Behavioural Research.  
- Framing moves from *lab trait measurement* to *clinical & institutional application*.

## 🏛 University: Example 002  

**Earlier lineage**  
- Behavioural observation in teams (BOAC, 1968–1972): coding discrete verbal acts (“proposing ideas,” “disagreeing”) without intervention.  

**Later application**  
- **Behaviour in Teams (BiT) project**: real-time coding of team behaviour in student groups, fed back as interventions.  
- Operant observation becomes **behavioural coaching and institutional training**, shifting from descriptive to prescriptive.

## 🏛 University: Example 003

**Earlier orientation**  
- Traditional operant/behaviourist content in psychology modules: controlled reinforcement studies, learning theory, clinical basics.  
- Limited explicit institutional embedding.  

**Later (current)**  
- **Complex Trauma & Resilience Research Unit (C-TRU)**: integrates trauma-focused therapies with outcome trials.  
- Shows behaviourist roots (conditioning, exposure, reinforcement) **embedded into clinical protocols** for psychosis prevention and resilience building.  
- Marks a pivot from theory to **applied, interventionist behavioural medicine**.

## 📊 Contrasts  

| Feature | Earlier (2005–2010) | Later (2015–2025) |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Controlled operant responses, rodent models, discrete tasks | Complex human behaviour in institutional contexts |
| **Actors** | Individual participants / animals | Teams, patients, researchers, institutions |
| **Method** | Lab reinforcement schedules, conditioning paradigms | Feedback loops, trials, trauma-informed interventions, ergonomics |
| **Frame** | Behaviour as outcome, internal states muted | Behaviour as social, empathic, trauma-informed, context-bound |
| **Risk vector** | Technical science, limited external uptake | Direct link to governance, PREVENT logics, nudges, institutional design |

*Behavioural Trajectories — From Lab to Institution* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how operant paradigms migrated into applied institutional contexts, transforming empathy and trauma studies into governance vectors.
