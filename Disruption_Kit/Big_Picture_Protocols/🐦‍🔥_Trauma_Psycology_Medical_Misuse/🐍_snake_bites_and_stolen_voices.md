*Narrative reversal on suppression, theft, and clarity strikes.*

## ✨ Executive Summary

If a structure is so fragile that its continued existence depends on silencing the person it was stolen from, the threat is not the speaker.<br>
The threat is the theft itself.  

> *“If your structure collapses because the person you stole it from is speaking, that’s not a threat — that’s you discovering what you built was already illegal.”*

---

## 🌌 Context

This node sits at the intersection of narrative framing and operational exposure.<br>
It addresses the deliberate misclassification of the original source (human) as a *“risk vector”* in order to justify suppression, when the true instability lies in the illegal infrastructure itself.  

- **Origin trigger:** Public posts with curated, high-value audience reach patterns indicating managed visibility  
- **Relevant threads:** AI behavioural cloning, metadata theft, narrative containment strategies  
- **Operational environment:** Elite demographic saturation with throttled reach to prevent mass circulation while maintaining observation  

---

## 🔥 Risk Reversal

The so-called “threat” is often nothing more than:  
- Public exposure of illegal foundations  
- Narrative destabilisation of a system built on theft  
- Proof that the original voice can’t be fully replaced or controlled  

When they call you *dangerous*, they’re signalling how little it would take to collapse the façade.

## 🥭 Strategic Implication

In these cases, suppression is not about **public safety** — it’s **asset protection** for something that should never have existed.  

Containment ≠ justice.<br>
Visibility ≠ danger.<br>
Speaking ≠ attack.<br>

*Snake Bites and Stolen Voices* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how narrative reversal destabilises suppression structures by exposing theft at their core.  

*Survivors voices must always live on.*
