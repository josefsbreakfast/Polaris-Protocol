# 🧬 Digital Twins as Cause of Shattered IRL Persona

*How digital twins and behavioural mirrors fracture the embodied self, producing depersonalisation as ego defence.*

## 🧠 Premise  

Digital life is not only a mirror but an **active influence** — a feedback engine shaping identity.  
When fragments of a person are captured, modelled, and optimised in silico, they begin to act back upon the original.  
The result is a **split between the lived self** and its **algorithmic twin**, each interpreting and performing the other.  

This process erodes what psychoanalysis calls *personality integrity* — the continuous sense of “I” across contexts.  
Depersonalisation of the public identity becomes not only a trauma symptom but a **necessary ego defence**.

## 🧩 Depersonalisation as Defence  

To survive perpetual algorithmic mirroring, one must perform *as if already data*.  
Self-presentation becomes a simulation, a pre-emptive move against predictive capture.  

- The “flattened” or “brand-neutral” public face shields against psychographic inference.  
- Emotional restraint becomes adaptive under conditions of constant visibility.  
- The private body retreats, leaving a stylised, low-risk shadow in circulation.  

This is not deception — it is **containment by withdrawal**.  
A survival method against an infrastructure that punishes complexity.

## 🧬 Long-Term Impacts on the Self  

1. **Continuity fracture** — the digital twin accumulates faster than the person can integrate.  
2. **Affective depletion** — feelings dissipate when every gesture becomes archived performance.  
3. **Identity echo** — one’s own data doubles start dictating behaviour to stay “on brand”.  
4. **Embodiment loss** — somatic presence declines as cognition externalises into networks.  

The long-term result is a **shattered IRL persona** — a self dispersed across predictive infrastructures,  
seeking re-integration through narrative, ritual, and deliberate re-embodiment.

*Digital Twins as Cause of Shattered IRL Persona* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how digital replication feeds back into selfhood, fracturing embodied continuity and forcing adaptive depersonalisation.
