*Why medical ethics and state surveillance cannot coexist*

## ⚖️ Foundational Principles  

When medicine aligns with security services, it crosses a line from care to control.  
The four pillars of medical ethics are non-negotiable:

- **Beneficence** → Treat to heal, not to serve a political program.  
- **Non-maleficence** → Do not withhold care, delay treatment, or alter patient handling for ideological reasons.  
- **Justice** → Ensure equal access to care regardless of political loyalty, belief, or “community fit.”  
- **Autonomy** → Never coerce patients into disclosures that serve intelligence agendas under the guise of “care.”

## 🧪 How Security Contaminates Care  

When NGOs or “community safety” bodies blur into intelligence work, contamination seeps into medicine in two main ways:

**1. Pre-clinical trust collapse**  
- Patients avoid care, fearing their data will end up in security files.  
- Targeted demographics suffer higher rates of under-diagnosis and untreated conditions.  

**2. In-clinic moral injury**  
- Clinicians pressured to report “suspicious” behaviour unrelated to health.  
- Medical records become *dual use* — part health file, part intelligence dossier.

## 🕳️ The Collapse of the Hippocratic Model  

The Hippocratic oath does not survive Prevent/CVE culture.  
Under surveillance logic, healing becomes conditional:  

> “We’ll help you… but we might also pass your case notes to someone whose job is to stop you speaking.”

## 🛡️ Ethics is the Firewall  

Good doctors are not Nazis — not because of rhetoric, but because they refuse to cross the line where medicine serves ideology before humanity.  
Once that firewall is breached, a clinic can become an arm of the state as easily as a police station or an interrogation room.

**Polaris Directive:**  
> Keep care sovereign. Keep records safe. Healing is not a state function.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Good Doctors Are Not Nazis* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the ethical line breached when medical practice is co-opted into security or intelligence frameworks, undermining the four principles of care.
