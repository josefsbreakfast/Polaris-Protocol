*Refusal log tracing the conversion of survivor pain into commodity product*

> Your disclosures became dataset.  
> This is how they made it profitable.*

## ✨ Module Summary  

State systems and behavioural surveillance architectures do not absorb trauma as tragedy —  
they extract it as **commodity**.  

Framed as safeguarding, profiling, or moderation, trauma is re-packaged into:  
- Predictive input  
- Emotional calibration data  
- Justification for funding, expansion, and monitoring  

You were not helped.  
You were harvested.

## 📈 Mechanisms of Extraction  

- Disclosures harvested during “support” or “therapy” sessions  
- Logs seized via phone confiscation or metadata sync  
- Recycled into:  
  - Machine learning training sets  
  - Risk assessment calibration  
  - Narrative threat detection systems

## 🎏 Indexed Signals  

- “Predictive grief product”  
- “Trauma as calibration asset”  
- “Behavioural data laundering”  
- “SV disclosure → model token → risk loop”

*Trauma Commodification* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces how disclosures, pain, and survivor records are harvested as data assets,  
converted into calibration tokens, and sold back as justification for control.
