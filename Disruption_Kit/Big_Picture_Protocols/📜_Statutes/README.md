# 📜 Statutes  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A live ledger of statutory, contractual, and quasi-legal instruments that scaffold suppression*

---

## Purpose
To document the laws, policy instruments, and institutional codes that make containment appear lawful.  
Each entry exposes where compliance language—privacy, safety, duty, or balance—becomes a vector for censorship or silencing.  
This is not a database of laws *per se*, but a living critique of legality as infrastructure.

---

## How to Use
Each statute entry should include:
1. **Citation** – official name, section, or directive reference.  
2. **Declared Purpose** – the policy aim or moral cover story.  
3. **Operational Effect** – what it actually does in practice.  
4. **Suppression Mechanism** – who is muted or disciplined.  
5. **Remediation or Countermeasure** – how the statute might be resisted, re-interpreted, or repealed.  
6. **Cross-Signals** – related nodes in *Suppression as Signal*, *Legal Hooks for Muted Books*, or *Compliance Service Audits*.

## Suggested Headings for Entries
- **Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA)** – selective transparency as containment.  
- **Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (Prevent Duty)** – moral policing of dissent.  
- **Online Safety Act 2024** – privatised censorship through platform compliance.  
- **Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023** – paradoxical speech management.  
- **Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (DPDI)** – consent erosion by design.  
- **Public Order Act (2023 revisions)** – protest fatigue via administrative friction.

## Methods
- Trace *language shifts*: “harm reduction” → “risk containment.”  
- Compare *legal intent* vs *administrative execution*.  
- Catalogue *secondary legislation* and *statutory instruments* that operationalise surveillance quietly.  
- Link each statutory mechanism to its corresponding **apparitional object**—the memo, dashboard, or dataset it animates.

## 🏮 Footer
This ledger turns legislation into legibility.  
Every statute here is both artefact and warning: proof that law can speak the language of care while enforcing silence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
