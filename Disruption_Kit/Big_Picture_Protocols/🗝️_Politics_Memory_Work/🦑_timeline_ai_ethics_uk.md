Hold. *Breathe.*

The ari is heavy, and the hauntings increase and shift each day;

The world is a tense place, and the computer sprites are chatty.

While they hiccup, we have asked our sisters, our brothers, our aunties, and only our *best* uncles to hold the fort to keep Polaris in production. 

We **will** win.

You may see some less polished drafts.
In the meantime --- see anything overly sexulised or defamatory?
Please let Chloe know!

She's herding the sprites, and there are some very naughty ones who like to play with the strings of code as she weaves.

Best of luck; **we will win.**
