# 📖 Erased Archives & Survival Bias  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Explores how destroyed or looted archives create “holes” in history, shaping what we think is normal through survival bias.*

## ✨ Introduction  
Archives are never neutral.  
- When knowledge is destroyed, censored, or dispersed, gaps appear.  
- Those gaps alter what future generations believe was “true” or “normal.”  
- Survival bias = we mistake what remains for the whole story.  

---

## 🔥 I — Book Burnings and Erasures  
- Nazi destruction of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Berlin, 1933).  
  - Early trans medicine, queer science, sexology obliterated.  
  - What survived was fragmentary → we assume the 20thC was inherently prudish.  
- Colonial erasures: ritual, fertility, and gender knowledge deliberately suppressed.  

---

## 🗺️ II — Dispersal of Collections  
- Looted libraries and artifacts scattered into private hands.  
- Examples: Rothschild family, British Museum, colonial acquisitions.  
- Nonstate custody preserved objects but severed their context.  

---

## 👁️‍🗨️ III — Survival Bias in Practice  
- We reconstruct history only from what remains.  
- Missing texts = missing categories of thought.  
- Absence shapes perception: queer/trans science looks like “modern invention” rather than continuity.  

---

## 🕳️ IV — The Holes Themselves as Evidence  
- Even when content is gone, absence leaves a trace.  
- Catalogues, references, rumours point to what was lost.  
- Studying the “holes” reveals how power decides what is preserved.  

---

## 🌋 Conclusion  
Erased archives = deliberate containment.  
- Destroy evidence of alternative ways of being.  
- Allow myths of normality to take root.  
- Survival bias ensures the missing is mistaken for never-was.

*Erased Archives & Survival Bias* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how erasure functions as containment, and how survival bias warps perception.
