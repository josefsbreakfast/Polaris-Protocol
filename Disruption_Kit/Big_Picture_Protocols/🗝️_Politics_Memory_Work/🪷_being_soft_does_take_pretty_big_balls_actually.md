it is the act of trusting humans again,  

and again and again and again,  

not in spite of or against theor monumental fuck ups,  

but whilet embracing the wholeness of everything humans are.  

just because im soft doesnt mean im not strong.  

i refer to my more defensive moments as "spikier", or as having hedgehof spines soecifically because they sre to protect the squishy but in the middle.  

it takes all of is great courage to keep exercising compassion and not allow it to hurt so badly that we stop showing care.  

that doesnt mean it has to look a certain way, and it bears no relation to politeness.  

its about being able to give people time and energy at reduced harm, and sometimes this does look a lot like giving people a specific direction to fuck off to.  

sometimes it looks a lot more luke what we traditionally associate with maternal values.  

a few weeks ago, i grabbed one of my cats pretty firmly.  it was uncomfortable for him. he wasnt keen on getting too close to me for a few hours after.  

the reason i grabbed him was because i was sat next to the windiw opened a bit more than normal for the humidity. he saw something and respondee as an apex predator would. somehow he had gotten wuite far in the gap by tye time i grabbed him. his shoulders were at the boundary.  

i grabbed him because he lacks the awareness that the window is on a hogh building; i did not want him to become cat pancake.  

sometimes we do things our kids dont like, and mamy of us struggle to assert the same boundaroes for behaviour with adults.  

we all get things wrong, and part of being very human (and also taking a pro-social role in a functional community and/or society) is that someyimes we have to draw those boundaroes in a way that may feel harsh.  

better than the social version of cat pancake, however.
