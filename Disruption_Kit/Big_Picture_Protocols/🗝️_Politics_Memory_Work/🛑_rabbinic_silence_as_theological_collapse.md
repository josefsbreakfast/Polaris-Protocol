# 🛑 Rabbinic Silence as Theological Collapse  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*How institutional rabbinic silence on Palestinian torture constitutes a breach in Torah’s moral architecture.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines why rabbinic leaders close to political power have largely refused to condemn torture and desecration.  
It interprets this silence as a **theological failure**, not a political accident — a collapse of the obligation to guard the fence around Torah.

## 🧩 Structural Outline  

### 1. Covenant and Responsibility  
- Torah as architecture of truth  
- “Build a fence around the Torah” as protective ethic  
- Silence as breach

### 2. Post-Shoah Fear Logic  
- Proximity to power as imagined safety  
- Holocaust trauma shaping political paralysis  
- “Do not anger the emperor” survival reflex

### 3. Collapse of Guardianship  
- Confusing loyalty to empire with loyalty to Torah  
- Moral anaesthesia dressed as prudence  
- Erosion of rabbinic authority

### 4. Consequences  
- Complicity in torture  
- Delegitimisation of Jewish ethics  
- Reproduction of Western antisemitism
