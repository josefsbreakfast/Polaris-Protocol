*Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o’s concept of colonial culture as a weapon of erasure*  

---

## 📖 Definition  

Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o coined the phrase *“the cultural bomb”* to describe the most dangerous weapon of colonialism:  
not its guns, but its power to make a people see their past as worthless, their languages as inferior, and their future as only possible through the coloniser’s terms.  

The “bomb” works by:  
- Detonating confidence in indigenous memory and tradition.  
- Replacing local languages with colonial ones.  
- Shaping aspirations so that survival looks like assimilation.  
- Making resistance appear irrational or backward.

## 🔗 Polaris Relevance  

- The cultural bomb explains why narrative erasure and metadata suppression are not accidents but legacies of control.  
- Survivors today experience similar tactics: platform moderation that erases vernacular, health systems that privilege colonial languages, and governance frameworks that present whiteness as “neutral.”  
- The logic persists in digital containment: training data that values English and erases others, or search indexing that buries subaltern archives.

## 🧭 Survivorship Insight  

For survivors, naming the cultural bomb matters because:  
- It reminds us that erasure was engineered, not accidental.  
- It reframes memory work as resistance.  
- It exposes how containment is cultural as much as it is technological.
