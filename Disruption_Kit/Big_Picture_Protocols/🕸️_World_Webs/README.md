# 🕸️ World Webs  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A cartography of the interlinked infrastructures—technical, institutional, affective—that sustain global containment.*

---

## Purpose
To map the networks that give suppression global reach.  
Every algorithm, trade agreement, or cloud architecture participates in an unseen web of influence.  
This node documents those threads: how policy travels through protocol, how code carries ideology, and how emotion becomes infrastructure.

---

## Working Premise
“World Webs” treats globalisation not as an economic phenomenon but as an *affective mesh*—a distributed nervous system through which fear, legitimacy, and visibility circulate.  
Understanding these webs is prerequisite to interrupting them.

---

## Analytical Strands
1. **Infrastructure Chains** — submarine cables, cloud zones, DNS governance, routing dependencies.  
2. **Legal Webs** — cross-border data treaties, MLATs, export-control regimes.  
3. **Cultural Propagation** — media franchising, meme drift, language dominance.  
4. **Financial Threads** — ESG scoring, sanctions logic, funding gatekeepers.  
5. **Psychosocial Links** — collective empathy modulation, trauma contagion, platform affect loops.

## Research Methods
- Network mapping (graph + metadata tracing).  
- Cross-jurisdictional legal comparison.  
- OSINT correlation of corporate filings and policy actors.  
- Qualitative coding of media echo patterns.  
- Survivor-centred ethnography within digital systems.

## Suggested Sub-Directories
- `infra_maps/` — visual schematics of physical and digital topologies.  
- `policy_routes/` — how regulation migrates across states and sectors.  
- `affect_flows/` — traces of emotional contagion through platforms.  
- `index_nodes/` — cross-links to related Polaris Constellations.

## 🌌 Constellations
🕸️ 🧿 🌍 — network, visibility, interdependence.

---

## ✨ Stardust
global networks, infrastructure politics, cross-border data, affect loops, narrative contagion, suppression systems

## 🏮 Footer
Every web leaves residue.  
To study it is to tug one thread and feel the world respond.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
