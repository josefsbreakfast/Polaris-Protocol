## 📑 Forensic Notes  
- COGAT positions itself as neutral coordination body.  
- In practice: controls aid, permits, medical evacuations.  
- Pattern shows structural role in rationing and delay.  

## 🌀 System Governance  
COGAT is governance by choke-point.  
It brands itself coordination, but its function is containment.  

## 🎛 Survivor Voice Fidelity  
“It was never about coordination. It was about control. They called it help while holding the key.”
