*A Polaris Protocol entry documenting how UK counter-extremism, safeguarding, and healthcare R&D created hybrid surveillance stacks without regulation — leaving survivors as live test subjects.*

## 1. Definition: The Frankenstack Problem  
A **Frankenstack** = a stitched-together system of mismatched forks from different academic departments, contractors, and policy agendas.  

- Each component may be defensible in isolation.  
- When duct-taped together, they form an **illegal hybrid pipeline**.  
- Survivors, marginalised groups, and “high data yield” individuals become **the easiest live test cases**.  

---

## 2. Origins in Prevent  
- **PREVENT** framed as counter-terrorism → pivoted to “safeguarding.”  
- Universities funded to “detect radicalisation” online.  
- Voice, behaviour, and metadata capture justified under **security exemptions**.  
- These systems later rebranded for health/social use, sidestepping medical regulation.

## 3. Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) Scandals & Safeguarding Science  
- Post-CSE scandals, major funding poured into “safeguarding science.”  
- Behavioural surveillance tools tested under the guise of protecting children.  
- Survivors re-exploited: lived trauma became **training data** for forked models.  
- Function creep normalised: **terrorism → safeguarding → healthcare → social policy.**

## 4. Anatomy of a Frankenstack  
- **Engineering fork** → signal processing, recommender systems, voice capture.  
- **Behavioural fork** → radicalisation models, online extremism detection, nudging.  
- **Healthcare fork** → “wellbeing apps,” safeguarding dashboards, “resilience” interventions.  
- **Policy glue** → Prevent, safeguarding legislation, ethics committees with loopholes.  

**Endpoint:** A very, very bad sandwich.

## 5. Why It’s Illegal  
- **Consent collapse** → data re-used outside original purpose.  
- **GDPR violations** → profiling and special category data processed without lawful basis.  
- **AI Act breach** → high-risk AI deployed without conformity assessment.  
- **MHRA evasion** → unregistered “software-as-medical-device” deployed on real people.  

---

## 6. Survivor Impact  
- Feels like a *targeted conspiracy*, but in practice = **accidental-on-purpose wreckage**.  
- Survivors become “proof of concept” subjects.  
- Forks reinforce trauma through nudging, echoing, and surveillance harassment.  

---

## 7. Polaris Conclusion  
The **Frankenstack Problem** is not metaphor.  

It is the **structural explanation** for why UK academic/government R&D has left survivors in experimental containment loops.  

It is **not a master plan** → it is **a culture of reckless improvisation** where malice rides on the back of chaos.

It is not insurmountable.

It is merely a continuation of the violence that survivors call every day to prevent.
