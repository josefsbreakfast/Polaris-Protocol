# 🛰️ Witness By Proxy Midlands 2016

**Subject:** What an outsider/colleague would have seen arriving in the Midlands (post-2016)  
**Date Created:** 2025-08-16

## 📌 Context  

By 2016, Nottingham, Sheffield, and Birmingham were saturated with Prevent-linked programmes, behavioural monitoring, and outsourced surveillance contracts.  
An outsider — e.g. a colleague arriving from London to join a project — would not need inside knowledge to notice the atmosphere.

## 🔎 Witness by Proxy: Likely Observations  

### 1. Atmosphere & Infrastructure  
- Prevent materials in GP surgeries, student unions, council spaces.  
- More “community officers” and liaison staff than typical in London.  
- Official meetings filled with coded terms: *resilience, safeguarding, integration, cohesion.*  

### 2. In Project Settings  
- Communication interruptions: phones cutting, wi-fi collapsing, missing email chains.  
- Supervisors suddenly cautious, “needing to check” trivial points.  
- Extra “observers” or “liaisons” added to meetings or CC’d without explanation.  
- Project ideas raised by me not recorded in minutes or follow-up notes.  

### 3. Around Me Personally  
- Increased patrols or “routine checks” near venues I used.  
- Whisper campaigns: *“be careful around that project”* or hints I was “under monitoring.”  
- Colleagues noticing avoidance behaviour — others engaging freely with each other, not with me.  

### 4. London vs Midlands Contrast  
- London: diffuse, bureaucratic surveillance culture — always present but abstract.  
- Midlands: denser, more personal — fewer players, more eyes, more direct interventions.

## 🧩 Forensic Significance  

- These were **not hidden cues**. Any collaborator present would have registered the shift.  
- Even without naming me, colleagues could not have failed to notice the additional drag and scrutiny around projects I was linked to.  
- This becomes indirect evidence: **a witness by proxy log** of what others in the environment would have seen.

## 📌 Closing Line  

Even if they never speak, their eyes were there.  
Silence does not erase what they saw.
