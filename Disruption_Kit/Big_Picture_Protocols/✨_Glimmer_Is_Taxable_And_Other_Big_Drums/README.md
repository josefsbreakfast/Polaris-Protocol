*What ho, chaps, chapettes and chapettex...! All aboard for a wonderful deep dive into ethical quandry, complete with all the Czech hedgehogs and Mulberry harbours one could wish for!*  

*Keep calm and, indeed, do carry on.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
If you wish to pretend you feel nothing when talking about Tiger Moths and never thought the *Ultimatum* was a fabulous name for a sinking boat?  

*Out you go!*

If you didn't enjoy Dunkirk and had no desire to hear the score on an LP?  

*Out you go!*  

Each node is written for the more normal people here, although why you are, is anyone's guess.  

Before I get another piece of paper with this as "evidence", can we please consider it as "a work of art", first?  
On the point of contension and wobbly opinions, do get a lawyer and write things down at an early stage.  

We wouldn't want anyone to do on Operation Big Drum on *us*, now, would we?

## ✨ A Little Note On Glimmer  
Alongside all adjoining operations, Glimmer was a spoof attempt which directly targeted radio communtications, making it a lovely little analogue for telecommunicationa interceots today.  
I do rather love that for our little Polaris Protocol, don't you?

*Further Reading:*  

["What fucking whips about Dunkirk." - Milo Edwards.](https://youtube.com/shorts/A-4R1YiIWXw?si=FoIYj2qY_8oqeUe6) - the funny one. 

["They've asked for the Moonstone; they'll have her... and her Captain."](https://youtu.be/NKUDfW2PZ9g?si=lF9iR6Zl0jEuCeUr) - the serious one.  

*Side notes for the non-coastal folk: Civilian services like the RNLI often only deployed one man per family out on patrols wherever possible, due to the real risk of loss. Trust in one's craft becomes not dissimilar to a chair, crutch, prostethetic, or crutch user's relationship with their kit; these tools become an extension of you, and someone else touching them feels similarly intimate. This is discussed excellently in Disability Intimacy by the late Alice Wong (z"L). Tl;dr: This was that unquestionable intaiacy with the Moonstone, not deliberately malicious disobedience.*
