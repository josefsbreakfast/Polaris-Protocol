*What ho, chaps, chapettes and chapettex...! All aboard for a wonderful deep dive into ethical quandry, complete with all the Czech hedgehogs and Mulberry harbours one could wish for!*  

*Keep calm and, indeed, do carry on.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
If you wish to pretend you feel nothing when talking about Tiger Moths and never thought the *Ultimatum* was a fabulous name for a sinking boat?  

*Out you go!*

If you didn't enjoy Dunkirk and had no desire to hear the score on an LP?  

*Out you go!*  

Each node is written for the more normal people here, although why you are, is anyone's guess.  

Before I get another piece of paper with this as "evidence", can we please consider it as "a work of art", first?  
On the point of contension and wobbly opinions, do get a lawyer and write things down at an early stage.  

We wouldn't want anyone to do on Operation Big Drum on *us*, now, would we?

I do rather love that for our little Polaris Protocol, don't you?
