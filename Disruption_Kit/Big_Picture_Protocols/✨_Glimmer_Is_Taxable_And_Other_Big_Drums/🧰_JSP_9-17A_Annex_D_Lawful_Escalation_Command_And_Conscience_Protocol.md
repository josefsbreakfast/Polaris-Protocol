## 0️⃣ Golden Rules — Read First  

These principles allow personnel and contractors to raise accountability concerns **lawfully**, without breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989 or internal security policy.  
Each rule below is supported by existing legislation, doctrine, or civil-service standards (see full appendix for citations).

1. **Don’t remove or transmit classified material** outside authorised systems.  
2. **Record facts contemporaneously.**  
3. **Name the risk, not the target data.**  
4. **Use lawyers early** — privileged consultation is lawful.  
5. **Maintain coded-communications discipline.**  
6. **Preserve evidential integrity.**  
7. **Keep honesty and candour in record-keeping.**  
8. **Plan like command, act like conscience.**

---

## 1️⃣ Stabilise Your Evidence (Without Leaking)  

- Draft a **timeline memo**: taskings, approvals, objections, responses.  
- Collate **unclassified artefacts**: public licences, SOP titles, meeting invites, redacted minutes.  
- Write a **risk statement**:  
  - (a) activity in question    
  - (b) foreseeable unlawful use    
  - (c) why existing mitigations fail    
  - (d) the remedy you seek.  

> **Template subject line:**   
> *RISK NOTICE — Export/Targeting Tasking — Clear Risk to IHL / Section 17 Crime-Reporting Pathway Engaged*

---

## 2️⃣ Internal Routes (Document Everything)  

- **Line Management / Command Chain** → Submit the risk statement; request written acknowledgement.  
- **Departmental Legal / Assurance teams** → Copy DSO + Records Officer + Export Control owner.  
- **Speak Up / Whistleblowing contact** → Request reference number.  
- **Service Complaints** → Register if serving; may invoke pause pending review.  

Use the phrasing:   
> “This is a protected crime-reporting approach. I am not disclosing classified material. I request a secure forum to brief an appropriate authority.”

---

## 3️⃣ External Lawful Channels  

Choose the **narrowest competent authority** able to receive secure information:  

| Category | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Police / CPS** | War-crimes or universal-jurisdiction teams |
| **Regulators** | Export Control Org., ICO, HSE (when relevant) |
| **Parliamentary** | Minister of the Crown, Select Committee clerk, Intelligence & Security Committee |
| **International** | ICC Office of the Prosecutor (via counsel) |

> **Section 17 hook:** If coercion or intimidation prevented you reporting a crime, confidentiality clauses cannot lawfully silence you.  

---

## 4️⃣ Writing the Disclosure  

Structure it as four boxes:  

1. **Facts** – neutral chronology.  
2. **Possible offences** – e.g. Genocide Convention Art I (duty to prevent); Export Control Criterion 2(c); witness intimidation.  
3. **Internal actions already taken.**  
4. **Requested remedy** – pause, review, referral, evidence preservation, anti-detriment protections.  

Header every document:  
> *“Protected disclosure concerning alleged criminal conduct; security-sensitive — request for secure handling.”*

---

## 5️⃣ Protect Yourself  

- Keep a **detriment log** (any retaliation: duties removed, threats, access loss).  
- Civilians → employment law protections for protected disclosures.  
- Serving personnel → Service Complaints + SCOAF if stonewalled.  
- Seek **injunctive relief** if suspension or clearance withdrawal is retaliatory.

---

## 6️⃣ If Told “Classified — You Can’t”  

Offer lawful work-arounds:  
- **Secure brief:** SCIF / closed session with need-to-know recipients.  
- **Metadata-only summary:** reference numbers, dates, form IDs (no content).  
- **Closed Material Procedure** or **Public Interest Immunity** route for judicial oversight.

---

## 7️⃣ Legitimate Remedies to Request  

- Temporary **pause / recall** of tasking pending review.  
- **Independent legal review** on IHL risk.  
- **Named Senior Responsible Owner** for accountability.  
- **Preservation order** on records and logs.  
- **Public summary** (redacted) of findings with timeline.

---

## 8️⃣ Red-Flag Behaviours (Collect, Don’t Argue)  

- “Don’t put that in writing.”  
- Career or clearance threats.  
- Removal from distribution lists / systems.  
- Retroactive document edits.  
- Use of personal devices or side channels.  

Each is probative of coercive control / witness intimidation.

---

## 9️⃣ Aide-Mémoire (One-Page Summary)  

- Never remove classified material.  
- Record facts contemporaneously.  
- Notify internally with dated risk statement.  
- Seek counsel early.  
- Route to competent authorities only.  
- Invoke **Section 17** if coerced or intimidated.  
- Document detriment and seek protection.

### B. Verification Guide — Finding the Sources Safely  

1️⃣ **Public Portals** → *legislation.gov.uk* and *gov.uk/government/publications* for Acts and Functional Standards.  
2️⃣ **JSPs** → Search “JSP [number] site:gov.uk”; if internal-only, ask your DSO to verify title + para.  
3️⃣ **Civil Service / Ministerial Codes** → Cabinet Office pages on gov.uk.  
4️⃣ **ICO / College of Policing** → open PDFs on their official sites.  
5️⃣ **Doctrine (JDP 0-01)** → DCDC page on gov.uk → latest PDF.  
6️⃣ **MODNET-only docs** → never export; record title + version + verified by DSO.  
7️⃣ **Version control** → cite doc name + year + para + access route.  
8️⃣ **If unverified** → mark [unverified – access required]; do not guess.  

| Example | Source Type | Access Route | Verification Note |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| OSA 1989 ss 1–4 | Statute | legislation.gov.uk | Public |
| GovS 007 §3.2 | Functional Standard | gov.uk | Public |
| JSP 440 Ch 2 §201 | Defence Manual | gov.uk / MODNET | Verify via DSO |
| DIMP §4.3 | Departmental Policy | MODNET | Internal only |
| JDP 0-01 §2.4 | Doctrine | gov.uk → DCDC | Public |

> **Reminder:** Verification is about traceability, not possession. If you can prove a rule exists and cite it accurately, you meet the transparency duty without breaching classification.
