*Navy as quantum maritime mystery and tea-based security culture.*  
<!--Guarding krakens and keeping British men in maritime garden sheds since 1543.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Somewhere beneath the grey Atlantic, the Royal Navy quietly maintains national serenity through strategic absence.  
Its greatest weapon is being too classified to find.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Kettle Diplomacy:** every crisis begins and ends with tea.
- **Eldritch Containment:** the Kraken Protocol (Phase II) remains ongoing since 1983.
- **Judgment Pressure:** passive-aggressive silence as an oceanic art form.

---

## 🧿 Analysis  
The Navy turns neglect into invisibility and invisibility into operational integrity.  
Its mission statement could read: “Exist quietly and let everyone believe we’re doing something important.”  
By the time budget cuts arrive, the fleet has already sailed beyond the spreadsheet.
