*Navy as quantum maritime mystery and tea-based security culture.*  
<!--Guarding krakens and keeping British men in maritime garden sheds since 1543.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Somewhere beneath the grey Atlantic, the Royal Navy quietly maintains national serenity through strategic absence.  
Its greatest weapon is being too classified to find.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Kettle Diplomacy:** every crisis begins and ends with tea.
- **Eldritch Containment:** the Kraken Protocol (Phase II) remains ongoing since 1983.
- **Judgment Pressure:** passive-aggressive silence as an oceanic art form.

---

## 🧿 Analysis  
The Navy turns neglect into invisibility and invisibility into operational integrity.  
Its mission statement could read: “Exist quietly and let everyone believe we’re doing something important.”  
By the time budget cuts arrive, the fleet has already sailed beyond the spreadsheet.

*Note: Run past command before moving to save either; the fuck up is almost certainly not ours nad almost definitely theirs. Remember that the Airmen can't be trusted with a compass (get too cocky with the maths) and the Army cannot be trusted with a compass (get too cocky with the pointy end).*  

*Best hide the new toys underwater, where none of the little bastards can see with their hands.*

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
