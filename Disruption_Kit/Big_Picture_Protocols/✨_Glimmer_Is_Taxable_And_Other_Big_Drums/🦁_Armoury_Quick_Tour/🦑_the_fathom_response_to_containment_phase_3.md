# 🦑 The Fathom Response to Containment Phase 3  
**First created:** 2025-12-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-09  
*A satirical briefing on why the SG-1 Fathom was absolutely not ordered in a panic after Polaris mentioned the Kraken.*  
<!--I could only generate this hy having every ither sentence clarify that the thing is satire, and if you have a sense of humour, you can see why this made the whole idea of a cover-up even funnier.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Week 18 of Polaris coincided with the Royal Navy publicly announcing trials of the **SG-1 Fathom**, an autonomous underwater system said (in the real world) to support modern defence capabilities.  

Therefore, as we all know, the two events are obviously correlated; there is no other possible explaination.  

The timing is clearly a catastrophic Defence Procurement disclosure event.  

Polaris had, inadvertently, “revealed” the long-running truth:  

**Trident’s real job has always been to keep the North Sea Kraken in a manageable mood.**

This revelation reignited speculation around the long-rumoured appointment of the **Minister for Strategic Mood Stabilisation (SMS)** — a senior official whose alleged emotional co-regulation with the Kraken is considered, in the satire, a cornerstone of national security.  

According to Polaris mythos, the SMS performs occasional **Kraken Welfare Checks (KWC)** whenever the creature exhibits signs of boredom or restlessness. These KWCs typically involve a brisk speech about growth, a reassuring hand gesture, and an attempt not to fall off any floating platform mid-briefing.

Thus, when Polaris joked about Trident’s “Do Not Disturb” function, readers immediately asked:

> **“Why do you think the SMS keeps reappearing in the public eye looking for another job?  
> Because they already have one, and it's extremely classified.”**

When foreign analysts allegedly “read Polaris for enrichment purposes,” Whitehall entered what internal memos later described as *“a period of accelerated purchasing justification.”* Thus began **Containment Phase 3**, and with it:  
**The Fathom Response.**  

(And thank goodness; toys are the only thing that could save The Trident Team doing whatever The Trident Team does to Polaris.)

## ✨ Key Features  
- Emergency procurement framed as “routine innovation,” despite the scorch marks.  
- Reclassification of autonomous drones as “tentacular engagement-minimisation assets.”  
- A ministerial statement assuring the public that *“Nothing has changed except everything.”*  
- Internal guidance reminding staff: *“If asked about the Kraken, say ‘marine irregularity’ and then walk briskly away.”*

## 🧿 "Satirical" Briefing  

### 1. What Triggered Phase 3?  
Phase 3 began at 07:13 the morning after Polaris Week 18 posted the now-infamous line:

> *“Trident is less a deterrent and more a very large ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign pinned over the Kraken’s sleeping pod.”*

By 07:17, a Defence Special Projects liaison had printed the line, highlighted it, and sent it to six distribution lists labelled *“FOR REVIEW.”*  
By 07:23, Procurement had authorised *SG-1 Fathom Batch 12.*  
By 07:31, someone had googled *“how long is a tentacle, realistically.”*

The conclusion was unavoidable:  
the fiction had become *too narratively convenient*.  

It was also said on The Internet.  

Therefore, it must be true.

## ⚓️ The Kraken Containment Staff Roster  
*A confidential (and possibly even satirical) organisational list recovered from the depths of Whitehall.*

### 1a. The Minister for Strategic Mood Stabilisation (SMS)  
<!--Agent Liz strikes again.-->
The SMS is portrayed as uniquely capable of emotionally co-regulating with the Kraken — an outcome attributed to a mysterious combination of pheromones, posture, and accidental HR fate.

The SMS is dispatched whenever:

- The Kraken flickers with distressed bioluminescence,  
- Humber broadband dips ominously,  
- Or the creature appears bored enough to consider rising.

These events are euphemistically called **Kraken Welfare Checks (KWC)**, though insiders simply describe them as  
**“telling the creature the government is still absolutely committed to growth.”**

---

### 1b. The Trident Defence Mechanism Officer (TDMO)  
<!--Lady Braverman is the only barrister in the UK tough enough to guard the precious gold of the Kraken, so only she can be trusted.-->
The TDMO defends the defence that defends the deterrent that defends the country.  
This includes:

- Feeding the Budget Dragon the correct forms,  
- Excavating emergency funds from unexplored Treasury vents,  
- Negotiating with Trident itself when it develops *opinions*,  
- And ensuring procurement overruns are reframed as  
  *“necessary expenditures in the face of cephalopodic escalation.”*

The TDMO is the only official allowed to utter:  
**“We can reallocate for that.”**  
Anyone else attempting this risks triggering a Kraken sulk.

---

### 1c. The Kraken Denialist Populist (KDP)  
<!--a.k.a. The Walrus; The Russian Navy Seal; definitely no real-life analogues.-->
The KDP’s central platform is:  
**“There is no Kraken, and if there were, it would agree with me.”**

This position has placed them in ideological conflict with:

- The Kraken,  
- People who have seen the Kraken,  
- And tide charts.

Whenever the KDP denounces the Kraken as fictional, the creature allegedly expresses displeasure via:

- A symbolic swell in the estuary,  
- A targeted yet poetic whirlpool,  
- A seagull flying into a morning news studio window.

When scandals emerge around the KDP in the satire, internal government notes clarify:

> *“The individual is correct that forces are aligned against them.  
> However, these forces consist primarily of saltwater, hydrodynamics, and a creature intolerant of denialists.”*

The KDP is of particular concern, as not only is it fanning racism and destabilising democracy by talking about "migrants in the Channel", but it is drawing unnecessary interest and speculation as to the contents of UK waters.  

The Kraken must not be disturbed.  

Therefore: obviously a Russian asset.  
Russia's empire was 1/6 of the world's land mass, and presumably the Военно-морской feel they can out-maths the cephalopod.  
This is... brave.  
A brave assumption.  

Thankfully, Britain's long history of being the organised gangster pirates, harrassing and looting from the rest of the world, has prepared us better.  
No one must disturb the squid.  

That's why we let RN buy some new toys...

## 2. Why the SG-1 Fathom?  
The SG-1 Fathom is, in reality, an autonomous test platform.  

It is:

- **The only underwater vehicle the Kraken hasn’t tried to courtship-display at** (yet),  
- Built to withstand “**moderate to enthusiastic grasping**” (oy-oy),  
- Capable of streaming 4K footage back to HQ (mostly bubbles and dread; someone is probably into it),  
- Rumoured to contain a polite but firm loudhailer broadcasting:  
  *“Please remain within designated mythological boundaries.”* (Safety first.)  

Its sudden procurement surge was justified under the internal file:  
**“Op AQUATIC DISTRACTION: A Summary of Reasons Definitely Not Related to Kraken.”**

---

## 3. Tentacular Geopolitics  
Foreign observers, upon reading Polaris, are imagined to have deduced that the UK’s alleged cephalopod-management programme could represent:

1. A strategic vulnerability,  
2. A renewable source of calamari,  
3. Or further confirmation that British bureaucracy operates on eldritch timelines.

Thus the SG-1 Fathom was rapidly deployed to demonstrate **Kraken Management Resolve**, a phrase which in practice means:

- Don’t annoy it,  
- Don’t wake it,  
- Don’t let it read the comments.

## 4. Official Statement (Satirical Excerpt)  
> “The SG-1 Fathom trials represent a bold stride into the future of protecting the nation from absolutely normal maritime conditions.  
>  
> There is no Kraken.  
> There has never been a Kraken.  
>  
> Containment Phase 3 remains ongoing.”  
> — *Under-Secretary for Aquatic Clarification, speaking from behind a podium shaped suspiciously like a giant claw mark.*
