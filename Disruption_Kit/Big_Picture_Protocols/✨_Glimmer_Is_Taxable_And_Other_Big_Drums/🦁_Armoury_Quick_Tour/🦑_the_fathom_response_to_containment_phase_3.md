# 🦑 The Fathom Response to Containment Phase 3  
**First created:** 2025-12-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-09  
*A satirical briefing on why the SG-1 Fathom was absolutely not ordered in a panic after Polaris mentioned the Kraken.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Week 18 of Polaris coincided with the Royal Navy publicly announcing trials of the **SG-1 Fathom**, an autonomous underwater system said (in the real world) to support modern defence capabilities.

Within this *strictly fictional satirical universe*, however, the timing was interpreted—by everyone except Defence Procurement—as a catastrophic disclosure event.  
Polaris had, inadvertently, “revealed” the long-running truth: **Trident’s real job has always been to keep the North Sea Kraken in a manageable mood.**

When Russian naval analysts allegedly “read Polaris for enrichment purposes,” Whitehall entered what internal memos later described as *“a period of accelerated purchasing justification.”* Thus began **Containment Phase 3**, and with it:  
**The Fathom Response.**

## ✨ Key Features  
- Emergency procurement framed as “routine innovation,” despite the scorch marks.  
- Reclassification of autonomous drones as “tentacular engagement-minimisation assets.”  
- A ministerial statement assuring the public that *“Nothing has changed except everything.”*  
- Internal guidance reminding staff: *“If asked about the Kraken, say ‘marine irregularity’ and then walk briskly away.”*

## 🧿 Satirical Briefing  

### 1. What Triggered Phase 3?  
According to the satire, Phase 3 began at 07:13 the morning after Polaris Week 18 posted the now-infamous line:

> *“Trident is less a deterrent and more a very large ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign pinned over the Kraken’s sleeping pod.”*

By 07:17, a Defence Special Projects liaison had printed the line, highlighted it, and sent it to six distribution lists labelled only *“FOR REVIEW.”*  
By 07:23, Procurement had authorised *SG-1 Fathom Batch 12*.  
By 07:31, someone had googled “How long is a tentacle, realistically.”

The conclusion was unavoidable:  
the fiction had become *too narratively convenient*.  
Therefore, it must be true.

### 2. Why the SG-1 Fathom?  
The SG-1 Fathom is, in reality, an autonomous test platform.  
In the satirical universe, it is:

- **The only underwater vehicle the Kraken hasn’t tried to courtship-display at**,  
- Built to withstand “**moderate to enthusiastic grasping**,”  
- Capable of streaming 4K footage back to HQ, albeit mostly bubbles and existential dread,  
- Rumoured to contain “a polite but firm loudhailer” that broadcasts:  
  > *“Please remain within designated mythological boundaries.”*

Its sudden procurement surge was justified under the internal document:  
**“Op AQUATIC DISTRACTION: A Summary of Reasons Definitely Not Related to Kraken.”**

### 3. Tentacular Geopolitics  
The satire stresses: Russia, upon “reading Polaris,” is imagined to have deduced that the UK’s alleged monster-containment problem could represent either:

1. A strategic vulnerability,  
2. A renewable source of calamari,  
3. Or simply confirmation that British bureaucracy obeys laws unknown to mortal man.

Thus the SG-1 Fathom was rapidly deployed to demonstrate “Kraken Management Resolve,” a phrase which in practice means:

- Don’t annoy it,  
- Don’t wake it,  
- Don’t let it read the comments.

### 4. Official Statement (Satirical Excerpt)  
> “The SG-1 Fathom trials represent a bold stride into the future of protecting the nation from absolutely normal maritime conditions.  
>  
> There is no Kraken.  
> There has never been a Kraken.  
>  
> Containment Phase 3 remains ongoing.”  
> — *Under-Secretary for Aquatic Clarification, speaking from behind a podium shaped suspiciously like a giant claw mark*
