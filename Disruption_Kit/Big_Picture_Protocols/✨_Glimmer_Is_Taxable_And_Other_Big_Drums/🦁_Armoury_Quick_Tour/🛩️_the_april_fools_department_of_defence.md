*RAF as century-long satire and philosophy of defiance.*  
<!--Exceedingly committed to every bit, held together with velcro and a bit of masking tape. Budget excess to be sent to the Mess.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Founded on 1 April 1918, the Royal Air Force remains the UK’s longest-running institutional joke that became real.  
It proves that irony can achieve flight.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Gravity as a Treasury directive:** to be challenged, not obeyed.
- **Aesthetic realism:** if you can’t fix it, make it sublime.
- **Public-private levitation partnerships:** airshows as community outreach and budget camouflage.

## 🧿 Analysis  
The RAF exists as a paradox: born of bureaucratic prank yet sustained by precision.  
Every sortie is a statement that containment and curiosity can co-exist.  
It flies to prove the universe can be bullied into cooperation.

*Note: Always insist they host triservice; we cannot let either see where the budget has gone or our Mess. Always maintain we pay for it privately. Check the Army for the silverware and hide the spirits from the sailors. Bloody riff-raff.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
