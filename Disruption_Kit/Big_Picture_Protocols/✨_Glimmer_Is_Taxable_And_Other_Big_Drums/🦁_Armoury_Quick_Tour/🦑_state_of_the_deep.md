# 🦑 The Truss Protocols: The State of The Deep  
**First created:** 2025-12-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-09  
*What Liz Truss really means when she talks about "the deep state" ousting her, with no reference to the economic crash, or the Long-Suffering Lettuce.*
<!--Was it misogyny? Yes. Was she also extremely ridiculous? Also yes. Both can be true.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explores a recurring risk within the **Kraken Containment Programme (KCP)**:  
long-term exposure to abyssal phenomena can cause former custodians to confuse:

- **the deep state** (bureaucratic inertia),  
with  
- **the Deep** (the actual abyssal cephalopod sealed beneath the UK’s nuclear triad).

A predictable failure mode occurs when a retiring Keeper attempts to warn the public of “shadowy forces,” only for everyone to assume they mean the Cabinet Office rather than a 94-metre mythic entity humming under Faslane.

This node maps the psychology, the comms failure, and the aftermath.

## ✨ Key Ideas  

### 1. **Depth-Conflation Syndrome (DCS)**  
A known effect of Kraken proximity:  
semantic drift where abyssal terminology migrates into political speech.

Symptoms include:  
- compulsive use of phrases like “deep state,” “dark forces,” “hidden tentacles,”  
- fixed belief that “I was removed by unseen powers,”  
- inability to clarify whether said powers are civil servants or an eldritch god of the North Sea.

### 2. **Misinterpreting Cephalopsychic Warnings**  
The Kraken communicates via **impression, not language**.  
Human recipients often register this as a vague sense of being undermined by:

- mysterious actors,  
- shadow networks,  
- unseen sabotage,  
- “people who didn’t want me in power.”

This is, in fact, the Kraken attempting to say:  
> *“I do not like loud noises or fiscal turbulence.”*

### 3. **The Post-Guardian Media Tour**  
Upon leaving office, former Keepers frequently express:

> “I was ousted by the Deep State.”

In KCP documentation this is annotated as:  
> *“Subject referring to giant squid, not civil service.”*

Public confusion inevitably follows.

### 4. **The Real Reason for Removal**  
Internal reports note that custodians are relieved of duty for:

- destabilising the Cephalopod Calm Index,  
- accidentally awakening Tentacle Three,  
- misplacing the sacred ladle used in the containment vat,  
- or **crashing the Kraken’s preferred macroeconomic conditions**.

But none of this can be said publicly, hence the euphemism:  
> “Change of leadership due to strategic differences.”

## 🧰 Mechanism  

1. **Containment duty** exposes subject to abyssal resonance.  
2. Subject internalises Kraken warnings as political sabotage.  
3. Semantic overlap between *deep sea* and *deep state* creates rhetorical bleedthrough.  
4. Media appearances amplify confusion.  
5. Nation misattributes eldritch miscommunication to factional drama.

This is a **communications failure**, not a coup.

## 🌊 Case Study:  
### *The YouTube Interview of 2025*  
A former Keeper gives a long-form interview describing:

- being undermined by “forces in the shadows,”  
- mysterious actors “working against me,”  
- an entrenched system that “rose up when I tried to change things.”

Public hears:  
> conspiracy rhetoric.

KCP hears:  
> *“She is talking about the Kraken again, time to update Kraken Containment Protocols.”*

Containment officers mark the event as a **Category-2 Lore Leak**,  
noting that no actual civil service conspiracy occurred,  
but the Kraken did briefly stir during an ill-timed fiscal policy experiment.
