*A brief orientation to the archive’s less sensible defensive assets.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Welcome to the **Armoury Quick Tour**, a subsection of *✨ Glimmer Is Taxable And Other Big Drums* dedicated to cataloguing the various structural, symbolic, and occasionally aquatic artefacts that the nation appears—however reluctantly—to rely on.

Here we house the satirical briefings, the myth-logic diagrams, and the quietly alarming notes on how pre-existing institutions attempt to keep things upright through a combination of tradition, improvised procedure, and wishful thinking.

Or, as the original curator put it on 2025-11-13:

> *“This is what we've got, pre-existing-institutions-wise, to resist.  
> What could possibly go wrong.”*

A question that has only grown more rhetorical with time.

## ✨ Purpose  
- To provide a **factual tour** of systems that are obviously not factual.  
- To document the **ceremonial tools, eldritch processes, and administrative stopgaps** that allegedly safeguard the nation.  
- To act as a **staging area** for the Protocol’s "satirical" explorations of defence, deterrence, containment, and other words that sound reassuring until one inspects the budget.

Nodes in this folder typically include:

- Overviews of **mythological defence assets**,  
- “Official” briefings of unclear origin,  
- Inventories of items no department claims to have ordered,  
- And explanatory notes for why everything is, technically speaking, fine.

---

## 🦊 Contents  
Current items in the *Armoury Quick Tour* include (but are by no means limited to):

- **🦑 The Fathom Response to Containment Phase 3** — an entirely sensible explanation for why the SG-1 Fathom was deployed immediately after someone made a Kraken joke.  
- Additional artefacts will be added as the situation continues to fail to stabilise.

## 🌌 Constellations  
🦩 🪄 🧠 🌊 — satire, systems parody, institutional anthropology, marine exaggeration.

---

## ✨ Stardust  
satire, defence folklore, institutional humour, containment mythos, organisational parody, big picture protocols

---

## 🏮 Footer  
*🦁 Armoury Quick Tour* is a satirical staging ground within the **Polaris Protocol**, offering short guided excursions through the nation’s most questionable protective mechanisms. It is not intended to reassure, though readers have reported an unexpected sense of clarity afterwards.
