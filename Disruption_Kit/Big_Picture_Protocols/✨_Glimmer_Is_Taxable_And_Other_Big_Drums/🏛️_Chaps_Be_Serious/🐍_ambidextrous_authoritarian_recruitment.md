# 🐍 Ambidextrous Authoritarian Recruitment  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-07  
*How authoritarian movements recruit from any direction by offering customised stories.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Authoritarian and fascist logics do not recruit by ideology.  
They recruit by *hunger*: belonging, security, identity, revenge.  
This makes them ambidextrous — appealing leftwards, rightwards, and centrewards simultaneously.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Why authoritarian movements are “axis-breaking”  
- Dual-channel storytelling: to the left, to the right  
- Identity hunger as recruitment terrain  
- Rapid growth under instability  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Not Left or Right — Opportunistic  
Authoritarian movements adapt:
- pro-worker rhetoric on one side  
- pro-order rhetoric on the other  
- anti-elite messaging to both  
- certainty to the disillusioned  
- stability to the anxious  

They shift masks according to audience.

### 2. Crisis as Fertile Ground  
Recruitment accelerates when:
- economies collapse  
- trust falls  
- public grief is high  
- institutions look weak  
- political narratives fragment  

### 3. Identity Hunger  
People join when they lack:
- belonging  
- meaning  
- dignity  
- community  
- security  

Authoritarian movements offer those quickly.

### 4. Speed  
Because they tell customised stories, they grow fast:
- each subgroup hears its own tailored narrative  
- coherence is not needed  
- traction is
