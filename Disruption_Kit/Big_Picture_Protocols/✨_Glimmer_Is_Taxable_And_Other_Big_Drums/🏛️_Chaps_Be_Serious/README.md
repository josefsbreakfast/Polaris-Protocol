There are moments, of course, when the levity must be set carefully to one side.  

Yes, yes.  
We do need to be terribly serious for a second.  

Accordingly, a set of terribly serious pressés has been prepared for the terribly serious chaps — the sort of documents that are read with furrowed brows, initialled in the margins, and referred to later as “having been noted”.  

That done, best be getting along now.  

There are, after all, booms to count with the armourers.

There comes a moment in the life of any nation when one must clear one’s throat, adjust one’s papers, and say — with as much politeness as can be mustered:

**“This will not do.”**

*Chaps, Be Serious* exists for precisely that moment.

This folder contains satirical (but scrupulously informative) guides to the workings, habits, incentives, and occasional lapses of the United Kingdom’s parliamentary and civil service machinery. It is written for readers who already believe — perhaps unfashionably — that institutions matter, process matters, and that the alternative to imperfect governance is rarely an improvement.

No revolution is proposed here.  
No fantasies of purity are indulged.  
No one is asked to abandon their post, their oath, or their sense of proportion.

Instead, this is a collection of gentle throat-clearings, raised eyebrows, and carefully phrased reminders that **authority without restraint, seriousness without judgment, and loyalty without thought have a regrettable tendency to end in inquiries.**

The tone is satirical because satire remains one of the few tools that allows criticism **without declaring civil war on one’s own civilisation**. It lets us say:

- “This is dangerous,”  
- “This is unserious,”  
- “This is not what the job is for,”  

without accusing everyone involved of villainy, treason, or bad faith.

These are guides for:
- civil servants who still believe in the integrity of process,
- parliamentarians who sense the temperature rising and would rather not fan the flames,
- defence and security professionals who understand that stability is a *discipline*, not a vibe,
- and conservatives who know — in their bones — that order is not the same thing as obedience.

Sometimes, we do not get the heroes we would like.  
We get the institutions we have.

So we do our level best with them.

> One might even say: **chaps, be serious.**
