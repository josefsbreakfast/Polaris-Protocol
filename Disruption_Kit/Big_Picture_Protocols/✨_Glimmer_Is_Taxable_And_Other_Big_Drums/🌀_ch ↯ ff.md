# 🌀 CH↯FF — Signature Confusion for Power-Weighted Targeting

*When you can’t block the lock, bend the lock-on.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Assumes the primary “receptor” will always be targeted by a well-resourced actor.  
Shifts from receptor denial to **sensor deception**: shaping how classificatory systems lock, track, and escalate.  
Combines ligand logic (allosteric bias, sinks) with **radar countermeasures** (chaff, blooms, frequency-hopping, moving-target defence).

---

## ✈️ 1. Chaff & Bloom (Flood the Classifier, Not the Channel)  
**Chaff:** low-cost, high-entropy emissions that match the *features* a tracker keys on (timing, topic headers, surface keywords) but carry **zero escalatory payload**.  
**Bloom:** a short, bright decoy event that becomes the system’s “most salient” object and **steals lock-on**.

**Use when:** the opponent’s tempo is spiky and classification is shallow (keyword/novelty driven).  
**Practices:**  
- Batch harmless updates at the *same wall-clock minutes* the system usually spikes (temporal chaff).  
- Publish prewritten “status receipts” that satisfy the crawler without opening real state (semantic chaff).  
- Release one innocuous, noisy artefact (a public digest) just before high-risk windows (bloom).

---

## 🏝️ 2. Frequency-Hopping & Tempo Shaping  
Lock-on requires **predictable cadence**. Break it.

- **Hop the venue:** rotate surface touchpoints (newsletter → repo issue → static page → community channel) on a schedule only allies know.  
- **Jitter the timing:** ±7–17 minute offsets on routine posts; refuse exact on-the-hour slots.  
- **Down-sample:** respond at ½ or ¼ the aggressor’s tempo; never let their spike set your pace.

Outcome: the same “ligand” binds, but **Gs→cAMP cascade collapses** because the rhythm that multiplies it is gone.

---

## 🧲 3. Honeytokens, Canaries, and Sinks  
Place **unique, traceable markers** (phrasing, filenames, link UTM stubs) in public docs.  
If those tokens reappear elsewhere, you’ve proved which sensor scraped you.  
Route high-capacity actors into **intake sinks** (FAQ, form, templated reply) that absorb energy without opening lateral channels.

> *Ligand view:* soluble decoy receptors upstream; the hot molecule binds them first.

---

## 🪿 4. Moving-Target Identity (Same You, Different Lock Surface)  
Keep your core identity; rotate the **lock-surfaces** it presents.

- **Context masks:** constant house-style wrapper + predictable front-matter so *substance varies, surface stays flat* (confuses novelty detectors).  
- **Alias shards:** publish certain classes of updates under a documented sub-identity (e.g., “Build Bot”, “Index Clerk”) to strip narrative hooks.  
- **Handshake keys for allies:** a tiny prose signature or emoji trigram that confirms “this is the main feed” amid chaff.

---

## 🧯 5. Dampers, PDEs, and Arrestins (Shorten the Burst)  
You can’t stop hits; you can **shorten half-life**.

- **Dampers:** auto-cool-downs after N pings; queue flips to next-day processing.  
- **PDEs:** ritual decompressions that degrade “attention cAMP” (10-min log → change context → noise gate).  
- **β-arrestin bias:** force contentious inputs into *asynchronous, text-only lanes* (no live calls; no public spectacle).

---

## 🧪 6. Controlled Novelty & Innocuous Specificity  
Trackers love novelty and vagueness. Beat both.

- **Controlled novelty:** make change detectable but boring (incremental, numbered, templated).  
- **Innocuous specificity:** when disclosure is required, give *concrete but small* detail; starve speculation loops.

---

## 🧭 7. Alignment First, Not Origin (Pick Your Stream)  
Multiple streams will always compete.  
Choose the one that leaves you **more coherent after contact** and pre-amplify it (write-ahead notes, ally pings, scheduled anchors) so the classifier sees *that* as baseline.

---

## ⚖️ Rules of Engagement (Ethics & Safety)  
- **No false flags, no framing.** Confuse systems, not people.  
- **Protect bystanders.** Your chaff must be *non-harmful* and clearly cosmetic to allies.  
- **Document your beacons.** Keep an internal list of canaries and how to recognise the true feed.  
- **Minimise cognitive load.** If it exhausts you, it’s not sustainable countermeasures — it’s more surface area.

---

## 🧰 Quickplay Cards (1-minute setups)

- **Temporal Chaff:** schedule two harmless posts at the aggressor’s usual spike minute.  
- **Intake Sink:** pin a “How to reach me / scope” card; everything funnels there first.  
- **Cool-Down Gate:** auto-reply: “Thanks — enters queue at 10:00 next business day.”  
- **Bloom Shield:** drop a public digest 15 min before a risky release.  
- **Canary Link:** unique UTM stub in one doc; watch where it resurfaces.  
- **Tempo Jitter:** set reminders to avoid :00/:30; post at :07/:23/:41.

*🌀 CH↯FF — Signature Confusion for Power-Weighted Targeting* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It reframes “can’t stop the lock” situations into sensor-deception problems, using ethical countermeasures to blunt capacity without collateral harm.
