## 🧭 Orientation  

Across history, moments of crisis have revealed an uncomfortable truth:  
To survive, you must rely on people who do not move or speak like you.  
To survive, you must often rely on people you do not like nor respect.  
What matters, is to _**survive**_.

From Dunkirk’s flotilla of fishing boats and ferries to the patchwork resistance of occupied France,  
from the barricades of Cable Street to the sewers of the Warsaw Uprising:  
Victory, when it comes, belongs not to perfect plans but to imperfect collaboration.  

You will have to get a little messy, and your hands a little dirty, if you do not wish to die on your knees.  

# 🦊🦡 Solidarity Is Often Grim, Actually  

I hate to be the bearer of bad news.  
(Lies; I love ruining a day.)  
The lives of "the left" are not a Bohemian dream, nor a romantic trist with poets.  
The reality of solidarity is often what it looks like to order enough of one type of fruit to seize the next day.  
It would be a little pointless to source dates grown under illegal occupation, so you have to find the time to get to the one store that has stock...  
This is the reality of what solidarity actually looks like.  

*It is not all glamourous work, and we do not need any more people interested only in their own voice.*

If Glimmer is taxable, then solidarity is likely under audit.  
The bureaucracy of virtue prefers forms over function:  
“Submit evidence of inter-sector cooperation in triplicate.  
Attach receipts for kindness. Declare mutual aid above the £50 threshold.”  

But true coordination — the Dunkirk kind, the Cable Street kind —  
rarely fits in a spreadsheet. It’s messy, multilingual,  
and usually smells faintly of petrol, bread, and adrenaline.  

You are lucky if it smells like nothing more aligned with "revolt".

## 🪴 Embodied Interdependence  

Human relationships are not codependent — they are interdependent.  
Like the root networks of trees or microbial biofilms,  
we exchange nutrients, information, and defence signals without asking permission.  

In social terms, this interdependence forms a kind of immune system.  
When demagogues, propagandists, or data brokers release toxins into the air,  
our community antibodies are cooperation, humour, and shared care.  

That means being in each others' presence for the long term.  
That means tolerating each other when we would really rather not.  
That means showing up again and again.  
That means not bending for a little breeze in the wrong direction.  

That means holding each other up.

## 🕯 Olam Haba — The World to Come  

Judaism speaks of *Olam HaBa*: the world to come.  
You work towards it, even knowing you may not see it.  
Similar ideas echo across philosophies — each of us  
contributing to a horizon that stays just ahead.  

Roles may shift: specialist or volunteer, paid or unpaid,  
front-line or quiet back-office.  
What matters is harm reduction, not performance metrics.  

You produce something a little more like the world you would want to step into in 200 years' time.  
Knowing that you are part of a process which does not willingly gift medals.  
That you must scratch that itch in another way.

## 🌳 Lessons for 2025  

In the UK’s ongoing reckoning with racism and radicalisation,  
we again need the Dunkirk flotilla — artists, lawyers, clergy, coders,  
teachers, and the aunties who run WhatsApp truth patrols.  

It’s not enough that each sector “does its bit.”  
We must stand united on at least one thing:  
that no system built on hate, profit, or control deserves quiet compliance.
