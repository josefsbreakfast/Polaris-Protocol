## 🪶 Description  
A large American Eagle attempting to pass as a British pigeon.

The disguise is technically present:
- muted colours,  
- flat affect,  
- vague claims of “just joking”.  

But the proportions are off.

The legs don’t fit.  
The gait is wrong.  
The creature cannot walk in a straight line.

Everyone can see it straining inside the costume.

---

## 🧠 Behavioural Indicators  
- Attempts irony without understanding understatement  
- Mistakes cruelty for dryness  
- Repeats the same joke louder when it doesn’t land  
- Looks confused when nobody laughs  

Often pauses as if awaiting applause that never arrives.

---

## 🧬 Migration Route  
American culture-war ecosystem → UK comment sections → “British humour, actually”.

Usually arrives convinced it understands the local terrain  
because it once watched *The Office* (US version).

---

## 🏠 Preferred Habitat  
- Comment sections beneath BBC articles  
- Social media replies where nuance has already left  
- Any space labelled “banter” but governed by no actual wit  

---

## 🧪 Why the Disguise Fails  
British humour relies on:
- precision,  
- timing,  
- self-awareness,  
- and an understanding of when *not* to joke.  

The Eagle relies on:
- dominance signalling,  
- repetition,  
- and the assumption that confidence equals legitimacy.  

The result is not satire.  
It is **a bird too big for the costume, tripping over its own feet**.

---

## ⚠️ Civic Impact  
When this creature appears during serious moments — such as hunger strikes — it performs a specific function:

- drains seriousness,  
- lowers the tone,  
- replaces moral clarity with consumer banter,  
- and encourages the room to disengage.  

This is not accidental.  
It is suppression via second-hand embarrassment.

---

## 🧯 Counter-Measure  
Do not engage.  
Do not correct.  
Do not argue.

Simply note, internally or aloud:

> “That doesn’t even work here.”

The Eagle cannot survive sustained indifference.  
It requires attention to stay upright.

---

## 🦤 Conservation Status  
**Non-Native. Poorly Adapted. Likely to Collapse Under Its Own Weight.**

---

## 🌌 Constellations  
🦤 🐦 🎭 🧠 — imported satire failure, cultural mismatch, humour as boundary defence.
