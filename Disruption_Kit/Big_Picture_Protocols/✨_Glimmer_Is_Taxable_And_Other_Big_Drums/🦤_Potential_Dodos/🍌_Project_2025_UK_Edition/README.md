## 🪶 Orientation  

Welcome, intrepid ornithologists of democracy.  
This folder examines how a North-American plumage known as **Project 2025** might attempt to migrate to the British Isles — and what native species could mistake it for a patriotic pigeon.  

Inside you’ll find:

- **🇺🇸 Project 2025 Summary (YAML)** — the original exotic specimen, carefully preserved.  
- **🇺🇸 Project Esther Summary (YAML)** — the sibling strain with campus camouflage.  
- **🇬🇧 Entrenchment Watchlist + Risk Matrix + Patch Plan** — local climate models predicting which habitats are most at risk of authoritarian nesting.  

None of these files are blueprints.  
They are *vaccines*: small doses of absurdity administered to build institutional immunity.

## 🦩 Field Notes  

| Section | Description | Threat Level | Antidote |
|:--|:--|:--:|:--|
| **🍌 Project 2025 Summary** | Imported species from the Heritage archipelago; loud plumage, thin evidence. | 🧨 | Contextual quarantine. |
| **🕍 Project Esther** | Moral panic disguised as public safety; feeds on campus Wi-Fi. | ⚠️ | Academic sunlight. |
| **🇬🇧 Entrenchment Matrix** | Native mutation; spreads via statutory instruments and PowerPoint briefings. | 🔥 | FOI & mild mockery. |
| **🧰 Patch Plan** | Reverse-engineered counter-vaccine: civic tech, law, and snacks. | 💚 | Implementation. |

## 🧭 How to Read This Folder  

Think of it as **a public-health leaflet for constitutional immunology.**  
Every spreadsheet is a biopsy. Every YAML file a histology slide.  
The prognosis isn’t terminal — but you *will* need better shoes and a sense of humour.  

When in doubt, remember the field maxim:  
> *If someone insists they’re saving civilisation, check your civil liberties.*

## 🏮 Footer  

*🍌 Project 2025 UK Edition* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how imported governance pathogens might adapt to local conditions, and how laughter can serve as early prophylaxis.
