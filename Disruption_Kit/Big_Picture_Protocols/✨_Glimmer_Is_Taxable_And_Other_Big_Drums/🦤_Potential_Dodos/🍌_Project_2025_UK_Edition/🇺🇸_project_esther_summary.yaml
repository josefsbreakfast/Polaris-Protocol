  Framing_and_Definitions:
    - Recharacterises the “pro-Palestinian movement” in the U.S. as part of a so-called global “Hamas Support Network (HSN)”.  [oai_citation:0‡Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/what-is-project-esther-the-playbook-against-pro-palestine-movement-in-us?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Links criticism of Israel, anti-Zionism, or campus activism to antisemitism and national-security threats.  [oai_citation:1‡PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/a-look-at-project-esther-and-trumps-approach-to-combat-antisemitism-on-campus?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Claims goal: “Dismantle the infrastructure that sustains the HSN ... within 12 to 24 months.”  [oai_citation:2‡The Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/report/project-esther-national-strategy-combat-antisemitism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  Core_Mission_and_Time_horizon:
    - Mission: Organise a coalition of willing government, civil-society and private actors to combat antisemitism via this blueprint.  [oai_citation:3‡The Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/report/project-esther-national-strategy-combat-antisemitism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Vision: Ensure that U.S.-based antisemitic movements cannot threaten U.S. citizens or the U.S.–Israel relationship.  [oai_citation:4‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Esther?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Time-horizon: Emphasis on rapid deployment (“within 12-24 months”) post-friendly administration.  [oai_citation:5‡Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/25/project-esther-trump-protests-deportations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  Key_Methods_and_Tactics:
    - Legal & regulatory: Use lawfare, anti-racketeering statutes, immigration/visa revocations, financial and civil-liability tools against targeted groups.  [oai_citation:6‡Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/25/project-esther-trump-protests-deportations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Surveillance & data: Research and document alleged “masterminds”, track faculty and student activism, identify foreign student visa issues.  [oai_citation:7‡Democracy Now!](https://www.democracynow.org/2025/5/19/project_esther?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Institutional control: Cut funding to universities deemed not tackling antisemitism; deny permits for pro-Palestinian protests; initiate faculty discipline.  [oai_citation:8‡CAIR California](https://ca.cair.com/updates/project-esther-a-dangerous-blueprint-for-censoring-palestine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Narrative control: Frame protest and dissent as terrorism-adjacent; label allied progressive movements (e.g., anti-DEI) as part of the problem.  [oai_citation:9‡Nexus Project](https://nexusproject.us/nexus-resources/project-esther-a-nexus-project-briefing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  Targeted_Domains:
    - Universities & higher education: Focus on campus protests, foreign students, faculty activism, funding threats.  [oai_citation:10‡PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/a-look-at-project-esther-and-trumps-approach-to-combat-antisemitism-on-campus?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Immigration & visas: Use visa revocations for foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy; treat activism as visa violation.  [oai_citation:11‡Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/what-is-project-esther-the-playbook-against-pro-palestine-movement-in-us?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Civil society & activism: Target progressive NGOs, boycott/campaign groups, student organisations aligned with Palestinian rights.  [oai_citation:12‡Al-Shabaka](https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/project-esther-suppressing-palestinian-solidarity-in-the-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Media & platforms: Seek to restrict or moderate "anti-Semitic content" on social media; direct private actors in narrative enforcement.  [oai_citation:13‡Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/what-is-project-esther-the-playbook-against-pro-palestine-movement-in-us?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  Implementation_and_Transition_Indicators:
    - The second administration of Donald Trump reportedly has acted on more than half of Project Esther’s proposals.  [oai_citation:14‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Esther?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - University funding notices and investigations launched with framing aligned to the Project Esther blueprint.  [oai_citation:15‡PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/a-look-at-project-esther-and-trumps-approach-to-combat-antisemitism-on-campus?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  Critiques_and_Risks:
    - Criticism: Excludes or downplays right-wing antisemitism; focusses almost exclusively on left-wing and pro-Palestinian activism.  [oai_citation:16‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Esther?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Risk to civil liberties: Aggressive framing of protest as terrorism; potential suppression of dissent and academic freedom.  [oai_citation:17‡Contending Modernities](https://contendingmodernities.nd.edu/global-currents/jvp-rejecting-project-esther/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Instrumentalisation of antisemitism: Some argue Project Esther uses Jewish safety as a pretext for broader crackdown on progressive movements.  [oai_citation:18‡Al-Shabaka](https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/project-esther-suppressing-palestinian-solidarity-in-the-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
