|------:|:------------------------------------------|--------------:|:------------|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     1 | Local ground control                      |          0.68 | Medium      | High-Medium    | Increased contestation at local level; legal challenges and FOI activity suggest consolidation efforts face structured resistance. |
|     2 | Personnel pipelines                       |          0.70 | High        | High           | Heightened scrutiny of senior roles, departures of long-tenured figures, and whistleblower-triggered oversight reduce insulation, though appointment structures remain intact. |
|     3 | Regulatory remit shrinkage                |          0.58 | High        | High           | EHRC remit discussions paused amid scrutiny; ICO consultation ongoing without confirmed narrowing of statutory authority.         |
|     4 | Emergency/discretionary powers normalised |          0.48 | High        | High-Medium    | Public order instruments advancing, but judicial constraint and reduced Prevent salience limit successful normalisation.          |
|     5 | Funding & contract levers                 |          0.66 | High        | High           | Central guidance remains active, yet enforcement appears contested; pressure increasingly decentralised rather than state-uniform. |
|     6 | Campus & academic pressure                |          0.78 | High        | High           | Ongoing tensions around speech and identity issues persist, though consensus pressure appears less unitary than prior quarters.   |
|     7 | Civil-service impartiality erosion        |          0.48 | High        | High-Medium    | Rhetorical pressure remains but no confirmed structural weakening of impartiality frameworks observed this quarter.               |
|     8 | Media & platform regulation pressure      |          0.53 | Medium-High | High-Medium    | Ofcom and ICO enforcement actions suggest regulatory activation rather than executive capture pressure.                           |
|     9 | Charity & third-sector capture            |          0.45 | Medium      | Medium         | No material structural change since Q4; investigations continue without expansion of oversight scope.                             |
|    10 | Narrative securitisation of dissent       |          0.73 | High        | High           | Judicial rulings and recalibrated security messaging reduce dominance of securitisation narratives, though architecture remains.  |
