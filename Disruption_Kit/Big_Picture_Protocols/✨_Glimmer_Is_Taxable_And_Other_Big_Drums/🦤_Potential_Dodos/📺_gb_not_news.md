# 📺 GB Not-News  
**First created:** 2025-10-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*A case study in regulatory cosplay — how to sell opinion as journalism and call it compliance.*

---

## 🪶 Orientation  

“GB News” is not about Britain, nor is it news.  
It is a masterclass in **semantic arbitrage**:  
borrow the gravitas of a protected genre, file the paperwork under a looser one,  
and watch the watchdogs chase their own definitions.

The trick works because the word *News* is a **trademark, not a licence category**.  
The Broadcasting Code cares about *content*, not *branding*;  
the Advertising Standards Authority polices *adverts*, not *attitude*.  
Between them lies a no-man’s-land wide enough for a studio set.

## ⚙️ The Mechanism  

| Legal Category | Requirement | GB Not-News Workaround |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **News programming** | Must be duly accurate and impartial at all times | Re-label as *current affairs* |
| **Current affairs** | May express opinions if “overall output” is balanced *over time* | Run 100 hours of one view, promise balance later |
| **Branding oversight** | None | Call yourself *News* and dare Ofcom to disagree |

**Result:** Regulatory relativism disguised as patriotism.

## 🧾 The Legal Grey Zone  

- **Communications Act 2003 & Broadcasting Code (Sections 5 & 2):** distinguish “news” from “current affairs” but leave the boundary porous.  
- **ASA & CMA:** limited reach; programme titles and editorial tone aren’t “commercial claims.”  
- **Consumer protection law:** viewers aren’t “purchasing” a product, so mislabelling isn’t actionable.  

Thus the channel operates as **GB Chat-Show With Flags Ltd**,  
while the name remains a kind of unregulated trust-mark.

---

## 💡 Cultural Consequence  

- **Viewer confusion:** audiences assume “news” standards, receive talk-radio theatrics.  
- **Market distortion:** genuine newsrooms carry higher compliance costs.  
- **Norm drift:** impartiality becomes a vintage value — quaint, collectible, unenforced.

The real product isn’t journalism but **affective certainty**:  
the comfort of outrage framed as national duty.

## 🧭 Potential Remedies  

1. **Truth-in-branding rule:** if *News* appears in the title, News-tier standards apply.  
2. **Mandatory genre disclosure:** onscreen tag — *“Current Affairs / Opinion Programme.”*  
3. **Faster Ofcom adjudication clock:** breach rulings before the next scandal cycle.  
4. **Public media-literacy tags:** teach audiences that “news” may now be decorative.

## 🪶 Field Note  

> *The Eventual Equilibrium Defence:*  
> the claim that 100 hours of bias will be balanced by a theoretical future hour of contrition.  
> It’s like calling a see-saw level if you just wait long enough.

*📺 GB Not-News* lives within the **🦤 Potential Dodos** exhibit of *✨ Glimmer Is Taxable and Other Big Drums.*  
It documents how a broadcaster can obey the letter of impartiality law while annihilating its spirit —  
proof that in post-truth Britain, even compliance can be performative art.
