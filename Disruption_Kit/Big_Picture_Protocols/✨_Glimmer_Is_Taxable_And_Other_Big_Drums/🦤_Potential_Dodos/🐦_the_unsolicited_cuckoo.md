# 🐦 The Unsolicited Cuckoo  
**Alternative Name:** Altitude Without Accountability  
**Classification:** Nest Intrusion / Institutional Distortion  
**Status:** Ongoing Hazard  
**First Sighted:** 2026-02-19 | **Last Seen:** Unfortunately ongoing

## 🪶 Description  
A brood parasite operating above canopy level.

It does not construct.  
It inserts.

It mistakes inherited altitude for structural integrity.

From height, the island looks durable.  
From the nest, the strain is visible.

---

## 🧠 Behavioural Indicators  
- Interprets proximity as permission  
- Treats boundary enforcement as persecution  
- Converts private disturbance into public administration  
- Requires disproportionate woodland resources to maintain personal comfort  

Flies higher when scrutiny increases.  
Calls this “weather.”

---

## 🧬 Ecological Mechanism  
The cuckoo’s survival strategy depends on other nests absorbing impact.

Host birds feed the intruder.  
Guard it.  
Protect it.

Their own young weaken in the process.

Nature tolerates this in balance.

Institutions do not.

---

## 🏌️ Resource Distortion  
When minor inconveniences occur,  
trained raptors are redeployed.  
Perimeters expand.  
Grass is combed.

The event is categorised as essential.

The island shifts slightly to accommodate the bird.

Repeated often enough,  
the shift becomes structural.

---

## ⚠️ Systemic Risk  
Unchecked altitude destabilises the canopy.

Smaller birds alter flight patterns.  
Public trust erodes in quiet increments.  
The nest becomes a place of calculation, not safety.

The cuckoo continues to circle.

---

## 🦤 Conservation Status  
**Non-native behaviour within a fragile ecosystem.**  
**Ongoing hazard. Requires containment before long-term island degradation occurs.**

---

## 🧯 Containment Protocol  
No spectacle.  
No vendetta.

- Reassert boundary law.  
- Remove disproportionate protection.  
- Refuse narrative reframing.  
- Return altitude to earned, not inherited.

Gravity is not punishment.  
It is correction.
