# 🦤 Potential Dodos — Spotters’ Guide to Imported Authoritarian Fauna

*A museum of extinct ideas that keep trying to get passports.*

## 🪶 Orientation  

Every empire breeds its own wildlife.  
Some species go extinct, others merely go on holiday.  
**🦤 Potential Dodos** is our quarantine aviary for antidemocratic concepts attempting to migrate to the UK under the visa category of “innovation.”  

Think of this as the Department of Metaphorical Biosecurity:  
we catalogue bad ideas before they nest in legislation.

Inside you’ll find:  
- **🍌 Project 2025 UK Edition** — the tropical bird of prey that insists it’s a dove.  
- Space for any other ideological hitch-hikers disguised as “reform”, “efficiency”, or “national renewal.”

## 📋 Mission Statement (Satirical but Legally Sound)  

To identify, label, and publicly ridicule imported governance pathogens before they achieve cabinet posts.  
We practice **preventative anthropology**: tracing how memes of authoritarian efficiency, moral panic, or divine hierarchy adapt to British weather.

Our motto:  
> *Better to laugh the fascism out of the room than to legislate it in.*

## 🧭 Typology of Dodos  

| Category | Behaviour | Migration Route | Preferred Habitat | Counter-Measure |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Theocratic Techno-Fixers** | Promise salvation via apps and austerity. | Silicon Valley → Policy Exchange → LinkedIn. | Procurement pilots. | Ask for the codebase and a theology degree. |
| **Moral Entrepreneurs** | Trade freedom for purity, usually yours. | Culture-war currents. | School curricula, morning talk shows. | Empirical sunlight and group laughter. |
| **Efficiency Necromancers** | Claim bureaucracy would work if we just removed the people. | Think-tank seances. | Cabinet subcommittees. | Remind them paperwork is the price of justice. |
| **Charisma Parasites** | Attach to any populist host; feed on applause. | Podcast circuits. | Comment sections, committee hearings. | Starve them of retweets. |
| **Algorithmic Scribes** | Translate prejudice into policy via pseudocode. | Data consultancy exports. | Government dashboards. | Demand the training set. |
| **Imported Moral Panics** | Arrive screaming about “freedom” while drafting censorship laws. | Transatlantic anxiety jetstream. | Ministerial briefings. | Comparative satire + FOI requests. |

## 🏛️ Field Protocols  

1. **Document the arrival.**  
   Capture screenshots, speeches, white papers — label the species before it molts.  

2. **Trace the ecosystem.**  
   Who funds it, who quotes it, who denies feeding it?  
   (All dodos insist they are self-sustaining.)  

3. **Observe without assimilation.**  
   Mockery must not become mimicry. Keep humour humane and citations sharp.  

4. **Archive ethically.**  
   Even absurdities deserve footnotes. One day historians will thank you for your sarcasm.

*🦤 Potential Dodos* is a living sub-museum of the **✨ Glimmer Is Taxable And Other Big Drums** constellation.  
It curates the evolutionary warning signs of antidemocratic behaviour so that archivists, activists, and accidental bureaucrats can recognise the species before it starts a ministry.
