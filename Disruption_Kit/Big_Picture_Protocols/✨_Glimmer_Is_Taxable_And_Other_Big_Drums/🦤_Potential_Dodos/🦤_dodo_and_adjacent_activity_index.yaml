      🏺 Heritage Hallucinations — The Re-Enchanting of Public-Health Disasters:
        When reactionary nostalgia runs out of wars to romanticise, it begins 
        sanctifying hazards. Smog becomes “the scent of progress.” Chimney soot: 
        “working-class glitter.” Lead paint: “microdosing patriotism.” 
        Expect upcoming GB News specials such as 
        *‘Lead Paint: Why Britain Was Stronger When the Walls Could Kill You’*, 
        complete with a former MP sniffing a windowsill and calling it resilience.
