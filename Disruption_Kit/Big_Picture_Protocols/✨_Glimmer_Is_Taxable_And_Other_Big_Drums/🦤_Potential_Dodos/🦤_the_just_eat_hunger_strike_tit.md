# 🦤 The Just-Eat Hunger Strike Tit  
**Common Name:** “Have You Tried Ordering a Curry?”  
**Classification:** Imported Banter / Low-Energy Cruelty Meme  
**Threat Level:** Socially Corrosive, Intellectually Embarrassing  
**First Sighted:** 2025-12-23 | **Last Seen:** 2026-02-19

## 🪶 Description  
A recurring attempt at humour in which hunger strikes are trivialised through references to food delivery apps, “cheeky takeaways”, or consumer choice.

Often delivered with:
- a smug pause,
- a look that says “I’ve done comedy”,
- and the implicit belief that repetition equals wit.

It does not.

---

## 🧠 Behavioural Traits  
- Treats a life-or-death political act as a lifestyle inconvenience  
- Substitutes consumerism for moral reasoning  
- Confuses cruelty with irony  
- Requires the audience to be *less intelligent* than the speaker for it to land  

Typically deployed by:
- people who think British humour is saying something cruel very flatly,  
- people who mistake callousness for sophistication,  
- people who have never actually watched good British comedy.

## 🧬 Migration Route  
American culture-war meme → flattened British social media → comment sections → “just a joke, mate”.

Often arrives wearing:
- faux British understatement,  
- a pigeon suit labelled “banter”,  
- and the confidence of someone who thinks the BBC is “too woke” but couldn’t name a single Radio 4 panel show.  

---

## 🏠 Preferred Habitat  
- Comment sections beneath stories about hunger strikes  
- Talk radio call-ins  
- Group chats where nobody actually laughs but nobody pushes back either

## 🧪 Why This Is a Dodo  
This joke fails on every level that British humour traditionally values:

- **No wit** — just substitution (“hunger” → “food app”)  
- **No insight** — avoids the political question entirely  
- **No timing** — arrives already stale  
- **No empathy** — confuses detachment with intelligence  

British comedy works because it:
- punches up,  
- exposes absurdity in power,  
- and understands when restraint *is* the joke.  

This does none of that.

It is not dark humour.  
It is **cheap dismissal** pretending to be clever.

---

## ⚠️ Why It’s Actively Harmful  
By framing hunger strikes as a consumer choice problem, this meme:

- avoids confronting state responsibility,  
- discourages public seriousness,  
- signals that empathy is unserious,  
- and normalises the idea that suffering is content.  

This is not neutral comedy.  
It is **suppression through boredom**.

---

## 🧯 Counter-Measure  
Do not argue with the joke.  
Do not “explain” why hunger strikes matter to someone using it.

Instead, apply one of the following:

- *Silence* (nothing kills bad humour faster)  
- *Mild embarrassment* (“That’s… not actually funny.”)  
- *Reframe* (“People are risking death. That’s not banter.”)  

Bad jokes rely on complicity.  
They collapse when treated as beneath the room.

---

## 🧠 Field Note  
British humour has survived:
- empires,  
- rationing,  
- Thatcher,  
- and panel shows with five white men named David.  

It did not do this so that the political crisis of our time could be met with a Deliveroo reference.

If the joke feels imported, tired, and stupid — that’s because it is.
