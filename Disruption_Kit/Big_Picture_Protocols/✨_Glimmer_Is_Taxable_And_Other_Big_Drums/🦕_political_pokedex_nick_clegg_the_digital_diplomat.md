# 🦕 Political Pokédex: Nick Clegg, The Digital Diplomat  
**First created:** 2025-10-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*A satirical species entry for the Centrist-to-Silicon evolutionary line.*

## ✨ Summary  

This rare **Bridge-Type Diplomat Pokémon** was first sighted in the Westminster wetlands before migrating to the Silicon ecosystems of Menlo Park.  
Known for its shiny centrism and multilingual communication skills, it evolved under coalition stress into a **Global Affairs hybrid**, capable of generating consensus fields across hostile jurisdictions.  
Its temperament is mild, its reflexes bureaucratic, and its natural habitat includes policy summits, think-tank panels, and low-oxygen comment sections.  

When properly motivated by the scent of *legacy*, it deploys its **Diplomatic Firewall** — a shimmering aura of consultation papers that can pacify even the most feral regulators.  
No longer dependent on salary berries, this species now subsists on reputation points, influence pollen, and the occasional moral victory.

## 🪶 Signature Moves  

- **Bridge Protocol Negotiation (90 DMG):**  
  Reduces regulatory hostility by 15 points; grants temporary press-politeness buff.  

- **Open Internet Invocation (65 DMG + Healing):**  
  Summons 2008 Web 2.0 nostalgia; restores credibility to adjacent reformers.  

- **Diplomatic Firewall (Ultimate):**  
  Upon coordinated smear attack, emits 12-page policy paper that confuses opponents for 3 turns.  

---

## ⚠️ Weaknesses  

- **Platform Residue:** Halve reform damage if any Meta token remains in play.  
- **Legacy Overhang:** Vulnerable to “Tuition Fees 2010” and “Tech Bro Guilt” attacks.  
- **Status Dependency:** Requires panel appearance every two weeks or confidence −10 HP.  

🔥 **Caution:** Radicalism previously contained by Coalition Government (2010-2015). Handle with light irony and ethical incentives.
