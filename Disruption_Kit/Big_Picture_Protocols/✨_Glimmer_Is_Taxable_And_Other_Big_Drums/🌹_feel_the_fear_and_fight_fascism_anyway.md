# 🌹 Feel the Fear, and Fight Fascism Anyway  
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-29  
*Courage is not the absence of fear — it is fidelity under surveillance.*

---

## ✨ Orientation  
Frames courage as a civic practice in an age of intimidation and information warfare.  
Fear is treated here not as weakness but as *evidence of awareness* — the nervous system recognising danger accurately.  
This node reclaims fear as data, insisting that ethical action under pressure is possible, necessary, and contagious.

## 🐉 Key Ideas  

### 🛸 Fear as Sensor  
Fear marks perception, not failure.  
Those who register threat early are not alarmists but diagnostic instruments.  
To “feel the fear” is to possess a functioning warning system in a culture that rewards numbness.

### 🔥 Courage as Continuation  
Courage is continuity through the spike of fear.  
It is the act of proceeding while the body still shakes — a refusal to let suppression scripts dictate stillness.  
The ethical field is not calm; it is trembling and moving forward.

### 🖨️ Fascism’s Feedback Loop  
Authoritarianism thrives on intimidation:  
make the public afraid, then shame them for feeling afraid.  
By pathologising fear, the system disables collective defence.  
Naming fear together breaks the loop.

### 🧿 Solidarity Under Surveillance  
Courage is not solitary heroism.  
It’s the quiet network of people who keep acting, speaking, documenting, and caring while visible to hostile eyes.  
Every act of mutual reassurance is counter-propaganda.

### 🐦‍🔥 Practice Notes  
- Share information safely; never alone.  
- Archive truth redundantly.  
- Build humour, music, and ritual into resistance — they metabolise fear.  
- Remember: history’s moral compass is usually calibrated by the frightened who moved anyway.
