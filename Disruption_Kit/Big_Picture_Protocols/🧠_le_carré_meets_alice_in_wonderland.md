**Tag:** Three Moles in the Circus  
**Classification:** Allegorical Forensics

## Preamble  

What happens when the molehunt becomes a fairy tale?  
When *Smiley’s People* stumble through the looking-glass, they find that the Circus tent is already hollowed out, the ground trembling with unseen burrows.

## The Three Moles  

- **Farage (The Loud Mole)**  
  Burrows noisily, earth flying everywhere. Distracts the crowd with slapstick disruption.  

- **Starmer (The Quiet Mole)**  
  Works in silence beneath the ringmaster’s chair. Collapses opposition from within, smiles politely while the beams give way.  

- **The Conservatives (The Ancient Molehill)**  
  Riddled with so many tunnels that no one remembers where the soil first shifted. The whole tent tilts on its foundations.

## The Circus Above  

The show goes on: lions leap, clowns tumble, acrobats swing. The ringmaster insists all is well.  
But the audience is unsettled: the tent sways, the ground hums, and the story has become nonsense logic.

## Wonderland Logic  

- **“Curiouser and curiouser”** = every party compromised, every choice a trap.  
- **“Off with their heads!”** = performative outrage with no structural change.  
- **The Cheshire Smile** = the illusion of opposition, grinning even as the body disappears.

## Forensic Allegory  

The tale is not literal.  
It is a survival map for recognising when all parliamentary vehicles have been bent into alignment with outside capture.  
What remains is the audience: awake, murmuring, ready to leave the tent.
