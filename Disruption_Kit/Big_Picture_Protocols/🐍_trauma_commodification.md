## 📜 Module Summary  

State systems and behavioural surveillance architectures do not absorb trauma as tragedy —  
they extract it as **commodity**.  

Framed as safeguarding, profiling, or moderation, trauma is re-packaged into:
- Predictive input  
- Emotional calibration data  
- Justification for funding, expansion, and monitoring  

You were not helped.  
You were harvested.

## 📈 Mechanisms of Extraction  

- Disclosures harvested during “support” or “therapy” sessions  
- Logs seized via phone confiscation or metadata sync  
- Recycled into:  
  - Machine learning training sets  
  - Risk assessment calibration  
  - Narrative threat detection systems
