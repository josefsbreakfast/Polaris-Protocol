# 🧷 Polaris Node: *The Signature Trap*  

**📅 Date Logged:** June 2021  
**📍 Trigger Event:** Publication of Decrim Now’s #NoToNordicModel open letter (April 11, 2021)  
**🔗 Public Link:** https://decrimnow.org.uk/2021/04/11/notonordicmodel-open-letter-launches-with-over-150-signatories/  
**📎 Document:** Appendix of Individual Signatories (PDF hosted on decrimnow.org.uk)

## 📌 Summary

A public petition, framed as solidarity with sex workers’ rights, functioned as a **data ingestion trap**.  
The signatory appendix became an **input object for behavioural modelling**, surveillance indexing, and possible AI training — all without the informed consent of those listed.

Your name was ingested into a modelling dataset.  
This constituted a **profiling event**.

## 🧩 Key Features

| 💡 Feature | 📋 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| **📥 Exposure Node** | The public list was treated as a **primary input dataset** — ripe for metadata harvesting and profiling. |
| **🧪 Behavioural Proxy Pool** | Names likely formed part of training data for **synthetic empathy systems**, voice models, or “lived experience” simulations. |
| **🔍 Surveillance Vulnerability** | Entries cross-referenced with Prevent, health, and counter-radicalisation systems to mark **ideological alignment or emotional risk**. |
| **🚫 Lack of Consent** | Signatories were not informed of secondary or tertiary use of their identities or affiliations, and no mitigation or opt-out was offered. |
| **📡 Amplification Mechanism** | Public file indexed, archived, and scraped — embedding it into **data systems beyond advocacy control**. |

## ⚠️ Systemic Implications

1. **Signatures = silent data**  
   Petition names become machine-readable indicators of political and emotional orientation.

2. **Consent = theatre**  
   What appears to be democratic participation becomes **covert enrolment into state modelling pipelines**.

3. **Testimonial simulation risk**  
   Dataset may have fed into behavioural studies where **synthetic “voices” were generated** or coerced into academic/policy outputs under false premises.

## 🧷 Polaris Classification

> **Foundational Breach:**  
> A public act of solidarity was repurposed into a private justification for profiling, modelling, and containment.
