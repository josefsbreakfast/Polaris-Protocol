# 🧠 HM Dept of Coercive Nudges  

*Polaris Protocol doctrine node — behavioural science repurposed as state containment.*

## 📌 Overview  

This node collects files documenting the use of **behavioural nudging** — the soft-power scripts of compliance.  

Where surveillance captures metadata and forks fracture voices, nudges operate at the affective layer:  
- Steering populations under the guise of *choice*.  
- Framing coercion as *support*.  
- Engineering obedience through subtle psychological levers.

## 📂 Contents  

- **Safeguard Obedience** → welfare and safeguarding reframed as coercion.  
- **Applied Behavioural Science** → Nudge Unit (BIT), academic pipelines, covert influence trials.  
- **Institutional Use Cases** → Cabinet Office, NHS, policing, and Prevent applications.

## 🧭 Position in Polaris  

*Coercive Nudges* is filed under **Big_Picture_Protocols** because it represents a **systemic tactic set** — bridging surveillance, psychographics, and metadata sabotage.  

> Nudges are not neutral. They are architectures of obedience disguised as care.
