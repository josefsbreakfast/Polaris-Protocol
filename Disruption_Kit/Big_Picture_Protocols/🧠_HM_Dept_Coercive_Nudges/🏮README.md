# 🧠 HM Dept of Coercive Nudges  
*Polaris Protocol doctrine node — behavioural science repurposed as state containment*  

**First created:** 2025-08-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-27

## ✨ Overview  

This node collects files documenting the use of **behavioural nudging** — the soft-power scripts of compliance.  

Where surveillance captures metadata and forks fracture voices, nudges operate at the affective layer:  
- Steering populations under the guise of *choice*  
- Framing coercion as *support*  
- Engineering obedience through subtle psychological levers
