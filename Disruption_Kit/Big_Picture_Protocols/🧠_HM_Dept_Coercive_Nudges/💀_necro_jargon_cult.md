## ✨ Core Analysis  

- Latin gives the illusion of timelessness and authority.  
- Abstracts violence into noble-sounding phrases (*“Civis non gratus”* = “We deported her”).  
- Creates an exclusionary club of the “educated elite.”  

---

## 📿 Patterns  

- Used to sanctify oppressive policy (*Acta non verba*, *Ordinem custodire*).  
- Common in legalese, mottoes, and creepy governance aesthetics.  
- Often paired with military or religious fetishism.

## ⚠️ Implication  

Latin becomes a form of aesthetic control — **soft power that primes docility.**

This file documents the use of classical jargon as aesthetic control, weaponising “timeless” language to sanctify violence.
