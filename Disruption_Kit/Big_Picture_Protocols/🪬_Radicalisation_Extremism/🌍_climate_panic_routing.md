# 🌍 Climate Panic Routing  
**First created:** 2025-09-12  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*On the extremist capture of climate despair — eco-fascism, collapse prepping, and recruitment through environmental grief*

---

## Purpose
To map how ecological anxiety is harvested and redirected into authoritarian, nationalist, or survivalist movements.  
This node treats *climate panic* not as an emotional flaw but as an exploited resource — a renewable fuel for extremism, datafication, and fear-based identity building.

---

## Mechanisms of Capture
| Vector | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Fear Translation** | Climate dread reframed as personal guilt, then externalised toward scapegoats. |
| **Moral Exhaustion Loops** | Constant exposure to doom narratives leading to susceptibility for “strong leader” solutions. |
| **Algorithmic Amplification** | Engagement metrics that privilege outrage and accelerate fatalism. |
| **Prepping Economies** | Commercialisation of scarcity; survival gear marketed as moral clarity. |
| **Eco-Purity Myths** | Racialised or exclusionary environmentalism (“return to purity”, “defend the land”). |

---

## Warning Signs
- Online communities using climate discourse to justify border closure or demographic control.  
- Messaging that shifts from collective repair to personal purification.  
- Recruitment through “resilience hubs,” “eco-retreats,” or prepping podcasts with covert ideological lean.  
- Reframing of mental-health language (“climate grief”) into behavioural surveillance or radicalisation triggers.  

---

## Research Threads
- Comparative study of eco-fascist aesthetics in digital media.  
- Tracking crossover between wellness, sustainability, and accelerationist spaces.  
- Content-analysis of algorithmic suggestion chains post-disaster coverage.  
- Survivor ethnographies of climate-related online communities.  
- Policy review: how counter-extremism teams classify or misclassify climate activism.

## Future Expansion
This node will evolve into a **Big Picture Protocol** within  
🪬 *Radicalisation & Extremism*, connecting to:
- **💀 Collapse Ideology Pipelines** – tracing despair → purity → violence arcs.  
- **🕊️ False Counter-Extremism Dialogues** – where environmental activism is co-opted by Prevent-style frameworks.  
- **⚙️ Algorithmic Governance Nodes** – documenting how platform logics monetise eco-panic.

## 🏮 Footer
This node studies how hope is re-engineered into fear, and how fear is repackaged as purity.  
The climate was never the only thing being engineered.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
