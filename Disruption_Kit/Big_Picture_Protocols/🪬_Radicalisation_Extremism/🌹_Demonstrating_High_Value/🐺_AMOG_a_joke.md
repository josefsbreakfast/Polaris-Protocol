# 🐺 AMOG (Alpha Male of Group): A Joke 
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-08  
*From bar-room rivalry to political street violence.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The term “AMOG” (Alpha Male of Group) comes from PUA forums, where it described the rival male who must be outshone, humiliated, or displaced in social interactions.  

The fixation on defeating rivals migrated directly into far-right masculinities, where dominance contests extend from clubs to streets, rallies, workplaces, and digital spaces.  

---

## 🚚 In the PUA World  
- **Definition:** The “alpha male” present in any interaction who must be dethroned.  
- **Tactics:** Status games, interruptions, physical crowding, undermining jokes, pre-selection through attention from women.  
- **Function:** Secure social dominance and portray oneself as the “true alpha.”  

---

## 🧪 The Wolf Myth  
- The concept of the “alpha male” in wolf packs came from early research on wolves in captivity.  
- Those wolves were unrelated individuals forced together, which produced artificial dominance hierarchies.  
- Later studies of wolves in the wild showed a very different reality: wolf packs are family groups, led by parents, with cooperative care of young.  
- The term “alpha” is now considered outdated by biologists, but it persists in PUA and far-right masculinities as a myth of naturalised dominance.  

### Domestication Insight  
- Russian experiments in the late 20th century demonstrated that wolves — like foxes and dogs — can be bred for docility and cooperation within just a few generations.  
- This shows how quickly “dominance behaviours” can shift when environments and incentives change.  
- The PUA and extremist fixation on wolves as eternal symbols of violent hierarchy is not only sexist — it’s scientifically wrong.

## 🧬 Humans Are Not Alpha-Wolf Packs  
- Anthropological evidence shows humans, like other apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas), do not organise around a single “alpha male” leader of the group.  
- Human societies are **pro-social by default**: survival depends on cooperation, food sharing, and collective childrearing.  
- Left to their own devices, many human groups show **matriarchal or distributed leadership patterns** rather than rigid male dominance hierarchies.  
- Patriarchy is not “natural destiny” — it is a **social enforcement system**, reinforced through law, religion, and violence.  

### Evolutionary Context  
- Claims that patriarchy is a driver of human evolution are **arguments about power, not neutral science**.  
- Far-right and eugenicist logics rely on the idea that what you are “born as” fixes who you are forever.  
- In reality, **socialisation, environment, and historical conditions** shape human behaviour far more than any myth of “destiny.”  
- To claim otherwise is to confuse ideology for evidence — like arguing whether the sky is green or blue when the facts are already visible.

## 🍆 Sexual Competition Evidence  
- In mammals, body morphology tells us a lot about mating systems.  

  - **Gorillas**: Huge bodies, very small testicles relative to size. Alpha male monopolises females; little sperm competition.  
  - **Chimpanzees**: Multi-male mating, moderate testes. Sperm competition matters; no single male dominates permanently.  
  - **Humans**: Large testicles *and* relatively large penis size for body mass. This suggests our ancestors lived in groups where **multiple males had access to females**, and sperm competition was central.  

- The human body does **not** point to a harem model where one male monopolises women.  
- Instead, it shows that men evolved in systems where they had to compete *with each other* for women’s attention and choice.  

### The Patriarchy Paradox  
- You can either have:  
  - **Big testes and large penises** (signalling sperm competition and multi-male mating),  
  - **Or** rigid patriarchy with total male monopolies.  
- Human biology shows we evolved the former.  

### Relationship Note  
- This evidence is not an argument against monogamy or exclusivity.  
- There is nothing wrong with traditional marriages, sexual exclusivity, or post-modern interpretations of partnership.  
- The point is simple: when men claim “science proves” they should control several women, they are misusing biology.  
- If they want to appeal to evolutionary science, the evidence proves the opposite of what they claim.  

### Why This Matters  
- Patriarchy is not nature; it is enforcement.  
- And the louder men shout that it is “scientific,” the clearer it is that they’re defending insecurity, not truth.

## 🪬 Political Masculinity Afterlife  
- **Street AMOG:** Competing rallies and counter-protests framed as battles for dominance over public space.  
- **Digital AMOG:** “Owning the libs” or destroying rivals in comment wars, livestream clashes, and ratio contests.  
- **Movement Framing:** Politics reduced to humiliation rituals, where power is proved through victory over rivals, not policy or governance.  

---

## 💼 AMOG in Workplaces  
The AMOG mindset also bleeds into professional life.  

- **Dominance Displays:** Men interrupting or speaking over colleagues, especially women or younger men, to assert authority.  
- **Social Undermining:** Jokes or subtle put-downs delivered in meetings to reduce another’s credibility.  
- **Status Choreography:** Engineering scenarios where others appear subordinate — seating, introductions, who gets credit for ideas.  

Like negging, these behaviours often hide behind “professional banter” or “team dynamics,” but their root is a PUA-style obsession with hierarchy.

### 📊 AMOG Logics Across Contexts  

| **Context**     | **How AMOG Appears** | **Function**                              |  
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| PUA subculture   | Outshine rivals in bars/clubs | Secure status, win attention from women |  
| Far-right rallies| Dominate streets, intimidate opponents | Prove group strength through physical presence |  
| Online culture   | “Own” opponents in debates | Claim discursive superiority, rally followers |  
| Workplaces       | Interruptions, undermining jokes | Enforce hierarchy, block others’ credibility |

## 🚩 Red Flag: Competitive Humiliation  
- If a man treats every interaction as a zero-sum contest, that’s AMOG logic at work.  
- What looks like “confidence” often masks insecurity and hostility.  
- Plausible deniability (“I was just joking,” “I didn’t mean anything by it”) doesn’t erase the effect: others experience humiliation and erosion of trust.  

---

## 🔥 Continuity & Harm  
- **Zero-Sum Logic:** Value is only gained by taking it from others.  
- **Violence Drift:** Social rivalry logics escalate into justification for street-level violence.  
- **Workplace Damage:** Meetings turn into contests of ego, sidelining collaboration and driving attrition.  
- **Democratic Erosion:** Politics collapses into performance of dominance rather than structures of care or governance.  

---

## 🛠️ Guidance for Recognition  
- Notice repeated one-upmanship, especially directed at women or junior staff.  
- Watch for forced “tests” in group settings — interruptions, mocking questions, public undermining.  
- Distinguish between healthy debate and AMOG contests: the latter seek humiliation, not clarity.

## 🐺 The Grey Wolf Beneath AMOG  
Alchemy already named the creature the PUA world thinks it discovered.  
The **Grey Wolf** (*lupus metallorum*) was said to devour the King — to eat the proud metal until it shone again.  
Jung read that wolf as the shadow that swallows the brittle ego of masculinity, burning it down to truth.  

The wolf was never a symbol of domination. It was a **teacher of humility**.  
In alchemy, the devouring leads to purification: the death of the false King and the resurrection of the Self.  
Jung saw in this the same arc as crucifixion and rebirth — descent, surrender, transformation.  

Modern “alpha male” culture repeats only the first half of the ritual.  
It stages endless crucifixions but forgets resurrection.  
Every rivalry becomes another self-inflicted death with no transcendence — an ouroboros of humiliation.  

The real alchemical turn happens when the wolf is internalised, not projected.  
When a man stops hunting rivals and asks instead: *what in me is hungry? what needs to be fed, not fought?*  
That question changes everything.  
Because once the wolf is seen as inner fire, the contest dissolves. What remains is heat — the warmth that can forge character rather than destroy it.

## 🚀 Turning the Image Around  
The myths and pseudoscience of “alpha” culture have one accurate intuition: **we are dissatisfied**.  
Men sense their lives shrinking into obedience or inertia, and someone tells them the answer is dominance.  
But the truth hiding inside that hunger is not for conquest — it’s for *aliveness*, direction, meaning.  

By re-reading the symbols — the wolf, the king, the crucifixion — we open new paths.  
We can look at ourselves without shame or posturing and ask:  

> What am I actually yearning for?  
> What would make me proud to be alive?  
> What would make the people around me safer, freer, happier because I exist?  

Alchemy’s lesson is not that men must die; it’s that we can **transform**.  
Dominance theatre sells obedience in disguise — obedience to algorithms, influencers, ideologues.  
Alchemy invites something else: agency.  
To burn away the false metals and find, underneath, a self that acts from purpose, not panic.  

That is the real work of the Grey Wolf.  
To devour the pretence so that the man — not the mask — can live.

*AMOG (Alpha Male of Group)* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how bar-room rivalry logics became the street theatre of political extremism, and how the same tactics corrode workplaces.
