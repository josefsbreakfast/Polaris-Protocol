*Exaggerated self-display as a demonstration of high value in PUA and extremist recruitment scripts.*

## 🌱 Scope  

Peacocking is a tactic in pickup artistry (PUA) and adjacent radicalisation cultures.  
It involves deliberate, often absurd, self-display — clothing, props, speech, or behaviour —  
to force social attention and signal supposed “high value.”  

What begins as coloured hats and loud shirts in PUA handbooks  
becomes a transferable logic in extremist milieus:  
loud provocation to test who looks, who laughs, who stays close.  

---

## 🦚 Definition  

- **PUA origin:** Neil Strauss’s *The Game* (2005) popularised the term.  
- **Behavioural tactic:** Dress or act in a way that *violates norms* to draw notice.  
- **Signal logic:** Creates a forced asymmetry: “I am the one you are all noticing.”  
- **Recruitment adaptation:** Converts into group tests — chanting, banner drops, or meme floods —  
  where spectacle functions as proof of status.  

---

## 🎭 Mechanisms  

- **Disruption of baseline:** Noise, costume, or props alter the usual flow of space.  
- **Attention hijack:** Anyone responding validates the peacock’s supposed social dominance.  
- **Group sorting:** Those amused or attracted are funnelled closer; those resistant are dismissed as irrelevant.  
- **Pipeline overlap:** Shared with marketing “shockvertising” and extremist meme warfare.

## 🧩 Links to Radicalisation  

- Early PUA → “Red Pill” forums → far-right influencers.  
- The lesson: control the gaze. If you can engineer who looks, you can engineer who stays.  
- Extremist groups scale peacocking to mass media: marches, uniforms, provocative flags, or slogans.

## 🪖 Uniforms as Peacocking  

The line from pickup artistry to political uniforms is straighter than it looks.  
PUA handbooks said: *“Wear something that makes people look.”*  
Fascist street movements applied the same logic: *“Dress alike so the street looks at us.”*  

- **Alt-right polos & khakis** — borrowed “everyman” uniform to stage mass belonging.  
- **Tiki torches (Charlottesville 2017)** — props as peacock feathers, engineered for TV.  
- **Paramilitary cosplay** — camouflage, tactical vests, insignia that exaggerate “warrior” value.  
- **Black Bloc** — inverse tactic: sameness + anonymity as the uniform that dominates the gaze.  

Uniform peacocking magnifies status display into **collective spectacle**.  
What was once “notice me” becomes “notice *us* — and fear or follow.”
