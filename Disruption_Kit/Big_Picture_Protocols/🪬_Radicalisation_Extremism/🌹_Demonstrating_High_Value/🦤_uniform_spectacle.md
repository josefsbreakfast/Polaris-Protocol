*When clothing becomes theatre: uniforms as collective peacocking and radicalisation signal.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

Uniform spectacle is the scaling-up of peacocking into a collective format.  
Where individual PUA tactics said *“wear something to force attention,”*  
extremist movements learned to coordinate dress and props to command the gaze.  

Uniforms function as theatre.  
They broadcast cohesion, provoke reaction, and offer initiates a ready-made identity.

## 🪖 Core Logics  

- **Sameness** — identical dress (polos, khakis, armbands, black hoodies) to signal belonging.  
- **Props as feathers** — torches, flags, shields, tactical vests; ordinary objects turned symbolic.  
- **Fear by symmetry** — the visual rhythm of dozens moving alike magnifies threat.  
- **Media capture** — uniforms engineer photographs: every lens is a recruiting poster.

## 🔄 Cross-Movement Variants  

- **Alt-right** — polos & tiki torches as “everyman cosplay” with menace.  
- **Fascist street movements** — armbands, banners, boot marches.  
- **Black Bloc** — anonymity uniform; power in sameness and indistinction.  
- **Religious sects** — robes, head coverings, colour codes as markers of moral high ground.  
- **Activist costume logics** — from clown blocs to Extinction Rebellion’s red robes: uniforms provoke and disarm in different registers.  

Uniform spectacle is not confined to the far-right.  
It is a transferable tactic: whoever can own the look, can own the gaze.

## 🎯 Mechanism of Radicalisation  

1. **Initiation** — “Dress like us” is the lowest-barrier test of loyalty.  
2. **Belonging** — visual sameness produces instant community.  
3. **Escalation** — once dressed, participants are more likely to act in line with the costume.  
4. **Spectacle loop** — the more the uniform circulates in media, the more recruits recognise the look.
