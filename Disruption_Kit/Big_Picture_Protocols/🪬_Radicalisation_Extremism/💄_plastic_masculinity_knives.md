## 📖 Testimony  

> I don’t hate machetes — machetes can be beautiful, serious tools.  
> What I hate are the bravado men with their bargain-bin cosplay knives.  
> The Andrew Tates and their plastic masculinity.  
>  
> It’s like a boy playing dress-up with a toy Hoover or a plastic kitchen set,  
> except these are grown men, seriously believing they’re tougher than everyone else.  
>  
> It’s cheap lipstick logic: the pound-shop gloss and glitter eyeshadow version of manhood.  
> Slap it on and call it strength.  
>  
> Capitalism feeds it — the plastic version of masculinity sold for a fiver down the market.  
> Diet pills for blokes. A quick fix for deep insecurity.  
>  
> It would be cute if it were a three-year-old waving a toy gun with a bright orange stopper.  
> But it’s not. It’s men who should know better, convinced their props make them powerful.  
>  
> It’s pathetic. It’s plastic. And it’s everywhere.

## 🔎 Analysis  

- **Frame:** Cosplay masculinity — insecurity disguised with props, toy-logic dressed as adult strength.  
- **Mechanism:** Consumer capitalism supplies the quick-fix symbols (cheap knives, diet pills, lipstick gloss) and markets them as identity.  
- **Effect:** Collapses masculinity into a purchasable surface. Humanity reduced to cheap display.
