## 🔍 What This Is (and Isn’t)
This is a **history-taking + response protocol** for suspected **Frankenstack** exposure — i.e., hybrid, dual/multi-use behavioural systems (CT/safeguarding/health + commercial recommender stacks) acting on a person and their social field.  
It is **not** diagnosis or treatment guidance; it gives **common language + structure** so survivors, supporters, researchers, and practitioners can see the same picture.
