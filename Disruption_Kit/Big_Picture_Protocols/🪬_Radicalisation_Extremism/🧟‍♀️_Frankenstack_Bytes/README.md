**First created:** 2025-10-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Frankenstack spin-offs — focused nodes tracing how hybrid behavioural systems generate and manage radicalisation, social-field effects, and recovery responses*

---

## ✨ Purpose  
**Frankenstack Bytes** is a micro-cluster within **🪬 Radicalisation & Extremism**, built to track the many ways that “stitched” systems reproduce radicalisation and social fracture.  
Each file isolates one dimension of the problem — from fear-driven breakdown to network destabilisation and community-level counter-stacks.  

These nodes operate as both **forensic analysis** and **clinical counter-practice**, showing how survivor-centred observation can rebuild understanding where policy has failed.

## 🛰️ Contents  

| File | Scope |
|------|--------|
| [🧟‍♀️ Frankenstack Radicalisation Hypothesis](./🧟‍♀️_frankenstack_radicalisation_hypothesis.md) | How hybrid safeguarding–CT stacks generate fear-driven violence and dysregulation. |
| [🪼 Frankenstack Social Field Effects](./🪼_frankenstack_social_field_effects.md) | How stacks destabilise whole networks through excitability and inhibition levers. |
| [🩺 Frankenstack Intake & Response Protocol](./🩺_frankenstack_intake_and_response_protocol.md) | Clinician-style playbook for identifying and de-escalating stack exposure; phased public rollout. |
| [🕸️ Frankenstack Multi-Modal Response Frame](./🕸️_frankenstack_multi_modal_response_frame.md) | Broad-spectrum, community-anchored counter-stack design using parallel interventions and tolerant metrics. |

## 🧠 Core Threads  
- **Dual/Multi-Use Theory:** same tools repurposed across security, health, and welfare.  
- **Excitability/Inhibition Dynamics:** how behavioural systems can over-stimulate or sedate publics.  
- **Clinical & Community Response:** intake, grounding, and multi-disciplinary rehabilitation models.  
- **Governance Failure:** absence of regulation enabling dual-use crossover.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Frankenstack Bytes* is a living sub-cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It extends **🪬 Radicalisation & Extremism** by gathering practical, clinical, and systemic responses to hybrid stack-induced radicalisation and social-field collapse.
