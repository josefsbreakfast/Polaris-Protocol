## 🧭 Orientation  

An article highly ranking on related SEO terms frames Christian nationalism not as a clear danger but as a spectrum of positions.  

It divides the ideology into categories (*confessional*, *cultural*, *civil*), offering a way for readers to see some versions as legitimate or at least debatable.  

This rhetorical move is a laundering mechanism. It makes Christian nationalism — which overlaps structurally with British fascist tendencies — appear normal, discussable, and even compatible with “good faith” politics.

## 🧩 Key Features of Laundering  

- **Taxonomising extremism**: turning authoritarian ideology into a typology with “acceptable” variants.  
- **Shifting the Overton window**: moving nationalism + religion discourse from fringe to centre by giving it “moderate” categories.  
- **Recasting risk as contest**: presenting existential threats to pluralism as a “debate about the nation’s soul.”  
- **Sugarcoating fascist adjacency**: softening associations with exclusion, authoritarianism, and violence.

*For many people in Britain, in the UK, being vague or taking a "non-partisan" approach is, by impact and by choice, taking a side against protecting our children and our loved ones.*
*Human lives cannot be political footballs, without the expectation of resistence.*
