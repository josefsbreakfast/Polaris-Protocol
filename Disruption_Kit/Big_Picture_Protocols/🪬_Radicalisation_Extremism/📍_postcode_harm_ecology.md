# üìç Postcode Harm Ecology: From Injury to Radicalisation

*Mapping how accumulated harms at local level create radicalisation ecologies*  

---

## ‚ú¶ Overview  
A postcode is more than a boundary: it can be an **ecology of harm**.  
When enough local institutions default to negligence or blame, entire areas become saturated with unresolved trauma. This saturation is fertile ground for radicalisation.  

## ‚ú¶ Structural Markers  
Key signals of postcode-level harm ecology include:  
- High prevalence of eating disorders and untreated trauma.  
- Widespread incapacity from workplace injuries without adequate recovery.  
- Visible intravenous drug use, spice, and other chronic self-medicating behaviours.  
- Council or university cultures where **the individual is always the problem**.  
- Cycles of child abuse and intergenerational violence.  

These signals stack. One university + one council mishandling harm can tip a locality into systemic breakdown.  

## ‚ú¶ Survivor Account  
> ‚ÄúNottingham has a huge eating disorder problem. A huge trauma problem. Spice, incapacity, injury. It‚Äôs not even hard to see. You only need a couple of institutions behaving this way for a whole area to collapse into harm.‚Äù  

## ‚ú¶ Radicalisation Link  
Extremism rarely comes ‚Äúout of nowhere.‚Äù It grows in soil where:  
- Marginalisation is long-term and embodied.  
- Institutions train people to blame themselves.  
- Violence and neglect become the normal climate.  

This is as true of alt-right emergence as it has been in UK case studies of Islamist radicalisation. Both exploit communities already eroded by harm.

*Postcode Harm Ecology* is a structural node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces how local harm accumulation becomes a demographic faultline and a vector for extremism.
