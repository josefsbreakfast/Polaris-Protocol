## ✨ Classic Coup Indicators  

| Indicator                               | Present? | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| Military takes direct control of govt   | ❌        | No tanks in the streets; military remains formally under civilian control. |
| Suspension of Parliament                | ❌        | Parliament still functions, though legislative scrutiny is hollowed out. |
| Mass arrests of opposition leaders      | ⚠️        | Not overtly, but policing of protesters and targeted harassment functions as "soft arrests." |
| State of emergency declared             | ❌        | No formal emergency; measures are disguised as security/terror policy. |

## 🩻 Creeping / Constitutional Coup Indicators  

| Indicator                               | Present? | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| Capture of watchdogs/regulators         | ✅        | Watchdogs stacked with loyalists; regulators (Charity Commission, EHRC, Ofcom) politicised. |
| Suppression of protest & dissent        | ✅        | Gaza protests restricted; CVE/Prevent reframed to label dissent as extremism. |
| Judicial/oversight erosion              | ⚠️        | Courts still independent, but systemic delays (SAR, MoJ) weaponise bureaucracy against critics. |
| Security agencies entangled in politics | ✅        | Intelligence/security policy tied directly to political aims (domestic containment, foreign policy). |
| Strategic contracts for allies          | ✅        | £2bn Elbit deal post-NEST divestment looks like bailout politics, not neutral procurement. |
| Media alignment & narrative control     | ✅        | Right-wing think tanks (HJS, Policy Exchange) deeply embedded in broadcast/media discourse. |
| International far-right alignment       | ✅        | Clear ideological sync with US/Israel security doctrine; cross-border funding + lobbying. |

## 📺 Public Sphere Effects  

| Indicator                               | Present? | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| Algorithmic throttling of dissent       | ✅        | Documented LinkedIn/other platform suppression of survivor-led anti-genocide voices. |
| Civil society neutralised               | ⚠️        | NGOs pressured, some academics silenced; still fragmented resistance. |
| Fear + chilling effect widespread       | ✅        | Dissenters report harassment, metadata capture, surveillance-based intimidation. |

## ⚠️ Consequences  

- **Classic coup?** → No (no overt seizure of power).  
- **Creeping/constitutional coup?** → Strong indicators present.  
This looks like **a right-authoritarian capture in progress** — slow, bureaucratised, plausibly deniable, and internationalised.
