## 📑 Summary  

Radicalisation and high-control systems thrive on **exploiting vulnerability**. This is not confined to one ideology. It is a cross-cutting tactic, visible from alt-right online communities to cult recruitment to state-level psychological operations.

---

## 🕹️ Core Mechanism  

1. **Find or create vulnerability.**  
   – People at points of stress (job loss, divorce, moving house, new baby, bereavement) become more pliable.  
   – Groups look for those “soft spots” or manufacture them.

2. **Seed a simple, emotionally charged frame.**  
   – Money fetishism, “alpha/beta” hierarchies, “other people are out to get you,” etc.  
   – Creates a sense of scarcity, status anxiety, and grievance.

3. **Offer belonging + an explanation.**  
   – Exploit feelings of being “half in, half out” of a dominant group.  
   – Present your ideology as the safe, strong option.

4. **Escalate control.**  
   – Combine sexism, misogyny and sexualised violence to enforce loyalty and create fear.  
   – Create insider/outsider dynamics; keep recruits feeling they might be rejected if they dissent.

## 🧠 Notes  

– Fetishisation of money and status isn’t incidental: it’s a vulnerability lever.  
– Alt-right and “pick-up artist” cultures are examples of monetised and weaponised male insecurity.  
– Cult recruitment patterns mirror intelligence-style psychological operations.  
– In British Jewish contexts there is an additional trauma-anchor: Holocaust memory and “trauma porn” narratives can be used both to elicit sympathy and to keep a community feeling permanently unsafe.  <!--Please can the white people who are not Jews and have no belonging to a persecuted group, kindly choose a different historical setting? Or a fantasy worldbuild? You have AI and the internet; you can do it! -->  
– Liberal Zionism’s tension (“in but not in” the dominant group) illustrates how this vulnerability can be double-edged: desire for safety and power vs. desire for autonomy and ethics.
