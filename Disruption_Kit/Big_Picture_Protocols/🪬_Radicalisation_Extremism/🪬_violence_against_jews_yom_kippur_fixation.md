## 🏮 Recognition  

On Yom Kippur 2025, two worshippers were murdered outside a synagogue in Manchester. A third person died when police opened fire.  

At the time of writing, details remain under investigation. But what is clear is this: violence on Yom Kippur is not aberration. It is continuity. Far-right extremists, pogromists, and Nazis have long chosen sacred time to inflict maximum desecration and pain.  

No one deserves to die by murder — not worshippers, not bystanders, not even perpetrators. Murder is not justice.

## 📜 Historical Patterns  

Antisemitic violence has often clustered around holy days. The perpetrators knew when Jews would be most visible, most gathered, most vulnerable. They struck then.  

- **Pogroms in the Russian Empire** often coincided with festivals.  
- **Hep-Hep riots (Bavaria, 1819)** erupted after emancipation, punishing Jews for citizenship.  
- **Kishinev pogrom (1903)** killed 49 and became a propaganda template: Jews cast as “agitators” even in their own destruction.  
- **Post-imperial pogroms (1917–1920)** across Austria-Hungary, Galicia, and Ukraine killed tens of thousands, framed as punishment for “Judeo-Bolshevism.”  

The Holocaust did not come from nowhere. It built on a century of pogrom logic, already well-practised in targeting Jews at their moments of visibility.

## 🕯️ Yom Kippur Under the Holocaust  

- **Łódź Ghetto, 1940 (Oct 9)**  
  Jews gathered in a makeshift synagogue were assaulted by Nazi troops and ghetto police. A **blood-stained tallit fragment** later recovered from the site bears witness to desecration on the holiest day.  

- **Babi Yar, 1941 (Sept 29–30)**  
  SS orders to assemble Kyiv’s Jews were issued on Yom Kippur. Over 33,000 were murdered at Babi Yar — one of the largest mass shootings of the Holocaust.  

- **Warsaw Ghetto, 1942 (Sept 21)**  
  Yom Kippur marked the **final day** of the Great Deportation to Treblinka. Tens of thousands were denied the chance to fast, pray, or be inscribed in the Book of Life.  

- **Clandestine observance**  
  Despite prohibitions, Jews whispered prayers in barracks, smuggled siddurim, and fasted in starvation. In Parschnitz camp (1944), Livia Koralek preached a Yom Kippur sermon to fellow prisoners. In Lodz, a clandestine YK service was photographed in 1941.

## 🪔 Survivor Testimonies  

- **Miriam Shevet (Northern Greece, 1941)** described Bulgarian reprisals that coincided with Yom Kippur as *“our black Yom Kippur.”* Though most victims were Greeks, she named the day as the only language vast enough to contain the massacre.  

- Survivors across ghettos and camps recalled **Nazi mockery**: offering extra rations on the fast day, intensifying labour, or timing raids to Yom Kippur — deliberate humiliation through desecration.  

- For many, Yom Kippur became a site of theological fracture: *why seek God’s forgiveness when annihilation was upon us?* Some lost faith, others held more tightly. Observance itself became an act of defiance.

## 🪬 Modern Echoes  

- **Halle, Germany (2019)**  
  On Yom Kippur, a neo-Nazi attempted to storm a synagogue with 52 worshippers inside. Armed with eight firearms and explosives, he failed to breach the entrance. He murdered a woman outside the synagogue, then drove to a kebab restaurant where he murdered a young man he believed to be Muslim. Convicted in 2020 of two murders and 68 attempted murders, his actions revealed the same logic: one hatred, many targets.  

- **Charleston, USA (2015)**  
  Dylann Roof murdered nine Black worshippers during Bible study in a historic church.  

- **Christchurch, New Zealand (2019)**  
  A white supremacist massacred 51 Muslims during Friday Jumʿah prayers.  

The pattern is constant: extremists strike when communities are most visible in sacred time and space.  

---

## 🕸️ Language and Suppression  

- Media framing rarely calls white supremacist attacks “terrorism” immediately, even when they are ideologically motivated and designed to terrorise.  
- Selective quoting of manifestos hides the tactical logic — the choice of sacred days is erased.  
- Online, searches for “Yom Kippur violence” are redirected to the Yom Kippur War or October 7th, burying Holocaust-era desecrations. This is **denial by suppression**: not screaming “it never happened,” but quietly removing it from sight.  

---

## ⚱ Continuity of Perpetrator Behaviour  

From pogromists in Bavaria to Nazis in Lodz, from Halle to Manchester, the logic is the same:  
- Strike on sacred days.  
- Attack Jews, Muslims, Black congregants — anyone marked as “foreign.”  
- Repeat until it looks like doctrine, because it is.  

---

## 🕯️ Kaddish  

We say Kaddish for those killed in Manchester on Yom Kippur 2025, and for those killed on the same day in Lodz, Kyiv, Warsaw, and Halle.  

Sacred time has been desecrated again and again. Suppression cannot erase it; perpetrators repeat themselves too clearly.  

To name the pattern is to resist it. To say Kaddish is to remember not only the murdered, but the continuity of violence that binds them.

## 🌌 Constellations  

These works form a constellation of texts orbiting Jewish survival, resistance, and meaning. None are neutral. Each offers tools or tensions that shape how we remember, resist, and repair.  

- **Mike Rothschild — *Jewish Space Lasers: The Rothschilds and 200 Years of Conspiracy Theories***  
  *Anchor:* Carefully documents the centuries of antisemitic conspiracy myths that culminate in modern far-right paranoia.  
  *Critical read:* Strong on history but tends to flatten lived Jewish experience into victimhood narratives rather than Jewish creativity and resistance.  
  *Connects:* Frames the conspiratorial backdrop that fuels pogroms, Holocaust denial, and neo-Nazi Yom Kippur attacks.  

- **Cindy Milstein (ed.) — *There Is Nothing So Whole as a Broken Heart: Mending the World as Jewish Anarchists***  
  *Anchor:* Collects anarchist Jewish voices who turn grief into radical solidarity.  
  *Critical read:* Risks romanticising fragmentation and pain; sometimes gestures more than it maps strategy.  
  *Connects:* Names mourning as political praxis — directly resonant with Kaddish in the face of desecrated Yom Kippur.  

- **Ariana Katz & Jessica Rosenberg — *For Times Such as These: A Radical’s Guide to the Jewish Year***  
  *Anchor:* Reimagines the Jewish calendar as a resource for radical, resilient practice.  
  *Critical read:* Its radicalism is uneven; sometimes more pastoral than political.  
  *Connects:* Places Yom Kippur and other festivals in living, resisting cycles, countering their erasure in state-driven memorialisation.  

- **Wendy Elisheva Somerson — *An Anti-Zionist Path to Embodied Jewish Healing***  
  *Anchor:* Grounds healing work explicitly outside Zionist frameworks.  
  *Critical read:* A manifesto more than a handbook; hard to access if you’re outside activist circles.  
  *Connects:* Insists Jewish survival and healing must be lived in the body, not outsourced to nationalist myth.  

- **Eliana Rubin — *Taking the State out of the Body: A Guide to Embodied Resistance to Zionism***  
  *Anchor:* Explores somatic practice as anti-state, anti-Zionist resistance.  
  *Critical read:* Highly personal voice, not always systematic in its guidance.  
  *Connects:* Offers embodied strategies to counter the exact logics of desecration and suppression documented in Yom Kippur testimonies.  

- **Alissa Wise & Rebecca Vilkomerson — *Solidarity Is the Political Version of Love: Lessons from Jewish Anti-Zionist Organizing***  
  *Anchor:* Draws on decades of Jewish Voice for Peace organising experience.  
  *Critical read:* Deeply tied to US activist context; risks being read as narrowly American.  
  *Connects:* Shows how solidarity redefines Jewish survival not as militarised sovereignty, but as mutual care with Palestinians and other oppressed communities.  

### ✦ Counterpoint Star  

- **Dara Horn — *People Love Dead Jews: Reports from a Haunted Present***  
  *Anchor:* Pierces the hypocrisy of cultures that venerate Jewish death while ignoring Jewish life.  
  *Critical read:* Written from within a liberal Zionist frame; avoids antiracist critique and fears diaspora survival.  
  *Connects:* Useful not as a guide but as a foil — it makes visible the gap between memorialising Jews as dead and living with Jews as neighbours.  

### ⭐ Resistance Star (The Chaser; "One For The Road"; The Unspoken Token That Any Ashke Jewish Voice Is *Forever* Expected To Include)  

- **Judy Batalion — *The Light of Days: The Untold Story of Women Resistance Fighters in Hitler’s Ghettos***  
  *Anchor:* Documents the overlooked stories of Jewish women who smuggled weapons, led uprisings, and fought back inside ghettos.  
  *Critical read:* Marketed as “untold” when many survivors told these stories for decades; risks framing women’s resistance as novelty.  
  *Connects:* Closes the constellation by insisting that Holocaust history must be remembered not only through mourning, but through resistance — armed, spiritual, and embodied.
