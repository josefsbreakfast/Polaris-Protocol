# ⚖️ The Strangest Duty of Care  
**First created:** 2025-09-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  
*The legal grey zone around universities’ responsibilities to students, and the cost of denial*

## 🌱 Scope  

This node documents the **duty of care paradox** in UK universities.  
Students are legally adults, yet structurally vulnerable.  
Universities are legally charities, yet structurally incentivised to distance themselves.  

The result:  
- Ambiguous duty of care lines.  
- Victim-blaming of distressed students.  
- Families left to campaign after loss.  

---

## 🧠 Stress Environment  

Even without prior diagnoses, entering university is destabilising:  
- Leaving home & networks.  
- Housing precarity.  
- Academic intensity & assessment stress.  
- Financial debt + part-time jobs.  
- Social isolation.  
- For international students: culture shock, visa insecurity, racism.  

These are *predictable structural risks*.  
They are not individual failings.

## ⚖️ Legal Ambiguity  

- Universities = **exempt charities**. Their trustees’ duty is framed as educational, not pastoral.  
- Students = **adults at 18**, no child safeguarding mandate applies.  
- Result: a vacuum.  
- Inquests and coroners (Bristol, Manchester cases) have pushed for statutory duties.  
- Universities resist: fear of liability, cost, and reputational exposure.

## 🗳️ Strange Comparison  

- **Voting**: Students can register at both term and home address; the state trusts them to self-regulate.  
- **Health & care**: No dual-safety-net. GPs, mental health services, and universities often assume “someone else” is responsible.  
- Outcome: vulnerable young adults fall through the cracks.  

---

## 🏛 Why Government Should Care  

- **Treasury**: Graduate output underpins economic forecasts. Student deaths and dropouts derail productivity assumptions.  
- **Politics**: A system visibly failing young people erodes legitimacy. Rebuilding trust pays electoral dividends.  
- **Democracy**: Universities shape citizens. Neglect strengthens authoritarian capture; care strengthens resilience.

## ✨ The Precipice  

We are standing at an edge.  

We can double down on denial — keep pretending distress is an individual flaw,  
let students fall, and watch resentment hollow out a generation.  

Or we can look directly at the grey zone: admit the risk environment,  
share responsibility honestly between government and universities,  
and design duty of care as if it matters to the survival of a democracy.  

Because it does.  

A country that abandons its students abandons its future.  
A country that cares for them can still redirect toward something better,  
something hopeful, especially for the young who are just starting their lives.

*Strange Duty of Care* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It captures how legal ambiguity, austerity logics, and reputational fear converge,  
leaving students unprotected in their most vulnerable transition.
