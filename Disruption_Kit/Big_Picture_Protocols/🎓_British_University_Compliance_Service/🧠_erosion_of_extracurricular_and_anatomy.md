*How per-head funding logic strips away tacit skills and cultural experience*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

This node records how spreadsheet logic has eroded  
the unspoken parts of British higher education:  
- **Cadaveric dissection teaching**  
- **Sports and societies**  
- **Informal cultural exchange**  

These were once central to the British education “brand.”  
Now they are the first to be cut, because they do not map onto KPI or per-head metrics.

## 🫁 Anatomy Lost  

- Dissection rooms once trained not just skills, but values.  
- Human Tissue Act + per-head economics = closures.  
- Replaced by models, software, “AI cadavers.”  
- Lost: tacit knowledge of the body, resilience in theatre, respect for donors.

## ⚽️ Extracurricular Squeezed  

- Wednesday afternoons off (for sport/societies) eroded.  
- Students working part-time jobs to cover living costs.  
- International students find siloed, closed-off experience instead of vibrant cultural exchange.

## 🔑 Consequence  

The UK is selling a **diminished product** at a higher price.  
What once made a British degree prestigious — breadth, tacit skills, cultural life —  
is hollowed out by spreadsheet logic.
