# 🌍 Soft Power and International Resentment  
**First created:** 2025-09-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-23  
*How UK higher education relies on international students, and how hostile politics erodes that trust.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

International students are the financial backbone of UK universities.  
They are also a pillar of Britain’s global soft power.  
When the UK projects hostility, instability, or complicity with violence,  
that soft power collapses.  

---

## 💸 Reliance  

- Overseas students pay £20–60k/year in fees.  
- Universities run deficits without them.  
- Alumni networks = global diplomatic asset.  

---

## 📉 Erosion  

- **Brexit**: EU students reclassified as internationals → collapse in flows.  
- **Research**: exclusion from Horizon Europe; consortia dropped UK overnight.  
- **Rhetoric**: “Stop the boats,” 2024 riots, alliance with violent regimes broadcast worldwide.  
- Result: UK seen as hostile and unstable.  

---

## 🔑 Consequence  

- Soft power premium = corroded.  
- Students and families resent paying more for less.  
- Universities exposed to financial shocks as recruitment falters.

*Soft Power and International Resentment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates British universities in the global perception economy —  
and records how political hostility undermines their very business model.
