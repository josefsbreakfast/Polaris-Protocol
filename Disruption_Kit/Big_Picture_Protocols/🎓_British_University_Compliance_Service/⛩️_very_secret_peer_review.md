*Hidden assessment practices inside British universities*

---

## ✨ Overview  

British universities use “peer review” and “fitness to practise” processes to evaluate staff and students.  
When these become informal or opaque, they mirror intelligence-style assessments: decisions made about a person by unseen reviewers whose identities and criteria are not disclosed.

## 🌀 How It Works in Academia  

- **Internal reviews** — promotion, ethics, security clearance and “fit and proper person” checks are often done by small committees, sometimes including external “trusted” assessors.  
- **Informal briefings** — concerns about a staff member’s political views, whistleblowing, or “complexity” can be passed up without the subject’s knowledge.  
- **Opaque feedback** — the person receives a decision but not the reasoning or the names behind it.

---

## 🌱 Consequences  

- Creates a hidden, parallel judgement system inside universities.  
- Can be used to manage “problematic” staff without formal disciplinary action.  
- Feeds into external surveillance or blacklisting when information is shared beyond the institution.

## 📜 Historical Precedents  

Hidden or secretive review processes inside universities are not new.  
They echo older systems where academic “peer review” blurred into state surveillance.  

- **USSR (1930s–1980s)**  
  Academic careers depended on “party reliability.”  
  Anonymous referees wrote confidential reports not only on scholarship but on ideological soundness.  
  Negative words — “bourgeois,” “cosmopolitan,” “anti-Soviet” — could end careers.  
  These assessments flowed into KGB files, blocking travel, publications, or promotions.  

- **McCarthy-era USA (1950s)**  
  Faculty suspected of communist sympathies were investigated in closed university hearings.  
  Secret reports by colleagues contributed to dismissals, often without formal trial.  

- **East Germany (GDR)**  
  The *Stasi* embedded informants in universities.  
  Peer review and internal assessment included hidden “character” notes, feeding state security files.  

- **Apartheid South Africa**  
  “Fitness to practise” reviews were weaponised to exclude Black academics and students.  
  Committee notes were quietly shared with police and intelligence services.  

**Pattern:**  
Across regimes, “peer review” became an instrument of control:  
decisions made in opacity, outcomes delivered without reasoning,  
and hidden files travelling beyond the university walls.
