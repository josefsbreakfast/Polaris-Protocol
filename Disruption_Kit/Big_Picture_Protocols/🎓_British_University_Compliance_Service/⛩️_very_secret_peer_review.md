*Hidden assessment practices inside British universities*

---

## 🧭 Overview  

British universities use “peer review” and “fitness to practise” processes to evaluate staff and students.  
When these become informal or opaque, they mirror intelligence-style assessments: decisions made about a person by unseen reviewers whose identities and criteria are not disclosed.

## 🌀 How It Works in Academia  

- **Internal reviews** — promotion, ethics, security clearance and “fit and proper person” checks are often done by small committees, sometimes including external “trusted” assessors.  
- **Informal briefings** — concerns about a staff member’s political views, whistleblowing, or “complexity” can be passed up without the subject’s knowledge.  
- **Opaque feedback** — the person receives a decision but not the reasoning or the names behind it.

## 🌱 Consequences  

- Creates a hidden, parallel judgement system inside universities.  
- Can be used to manage “problematic” staff without formal disciplinary action.  
- Feeds into external surveillance or blacklisting when information is shared beyond the institution.
