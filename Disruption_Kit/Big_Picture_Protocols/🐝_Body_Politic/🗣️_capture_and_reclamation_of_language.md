# 🗣️ Capture and Reclamation of Language  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*How disabled people reclaim terms like “crip” — and why outsider use is not the same*  

---

## 📖 Definition  

Language is never neutral. Words like *crip*, *mad*, *lame*, *idiot* were all used historically to mark disabled people as inferior, institutionalise them, or justify violence.  

Disabled communities sometimes **reclaim** those words — not to endorse the insult, but to invert it, to make it ours, to use it as a tool of solidarity and refusal.  

That reclamation does not license outsiders to use the same terms. Context matters. Relationship matters. Survivorship matters.

## 🌀 Patterns  

- **Eugenic capture:** language historically used to categorise, sterilise, and segregate disabled people.  
- **Insult mainstreaming:** words like “idiot” or “moron” were once medical categories — now everyday slurs.  
- **Community reclamation:** terms like *crip* and *mad* turned inside-out as solidarity, humour, and defiance.  
- **Outsider misuse:** when non-disabled people use the same words, they reinscribe harm rather than break it.  

---

## 🌱 Counterforce  

- **Context clarity:** who is speaking matters. Survivors reclaiming ≠ outsiders mocking.  
- **Education:** explain the history so outsiders understand why the distinction exists.  
- **Cultural sovereignty:** disabled communities decide how their words live, not institutions.

*Capture and Reclamation of Language* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates language as both a tool of containment and a site of disabled resistance.
