# 🦿 Eugenics as Everyday Metaphor  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*How insults and metaphors recycle eugenic logics even in radical spaces*  

---

## 📖 Definition  

Eugenics is not just sterilisation programs. It is in our language. Every time we call a bad policy “crippled,” every time we mock a politician as “brain-dead,” we reinforce the idea that disability = inferiority.  

Even emancipated thinkers use disability as their insult of choice. They would never use racist or misogynist slurs, but they still compare their enemies to disability. That is eugenic logic in drag.  

---

## 🌀 Patterns  

- **Mockery as shorthand:** Idiot, moron, lame — casual words with institutional roots.  
- **Policy discourse:** “Crippled economy,” “blind justice.”  
- **Leftist hypocrisy:** Radicals critique empire and patriarchy but still use disability as a smear.  
- **Erasure of history:** Forgetting that disabled people were first targets of extermination programs.  

---

## 🌱 Counterforce  

- **Name it:** Don’t let “just an insult” slide — call it what it is.  
- **Unlearn:** Replace lazy metaphors with accurate critique.  
- **Reframe:** Disability is not the opposite of intelligence, value, or humanity.

*Eugenics as Everyday Metaphor* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It exposes how ableism remains the unbroken chain of eugenic logic in everyday language and politics.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
