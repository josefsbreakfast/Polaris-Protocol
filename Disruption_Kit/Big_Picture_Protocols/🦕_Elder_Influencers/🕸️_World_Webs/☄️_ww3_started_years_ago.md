# ☄️ Already in World War 3  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*The argument that a third world war is ongoing, but mis-recognised.*  

---

## 📖 Core Claim  

World War 3 is not a hypothetical future.  
It is ongoing — diffuse, distributed, and already several years deep.  

The refusal to name it as such is itself a containment tactic: by calling each front a “conflict,” a “counterterror campaign,” a “security operation,” systems defer acknowledgement of a global war already in motion.

## 🌀 Features of an Ongoing World War  

- **Multi-front** → Ukraine, Gaza, the South China Sea, Horn of Africa — each “localised” but structurally linked.  
- **Distributed warfare** → Cyber, finance, disinformation, sanctions, migration routes.  
- **Climate as weapon** → control of water, food, and disaster response.  
- **Invisible thresholds** → no single declaration; escalation smuggled through “special operations.”  

---

## 🔮 Why Mis-Recognised?  

- **Language management** → war renamed as “police action” or “counter-extremism.”  
- **Media suppression** → ongoing casualties framed as “clashes” or “flare-ups.”  
- **Legitimacy stakes** → admitting WW3 breaks the myth of post-1945 peace order.

*☄️ Already in World War 3* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It argues that the third world war is not a coming possibility but a present, mis-labelled condition.
