# 🕌 Muslims as Primary Outgroup in Holocaust Mechanism  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-19  
*Why contemporary fascist patterning centres Muslims, with antisemitism acting as connective tissue.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node articulates how Muslims have become the **centralised “threat object”** in modern Western eliminationist narratives.  
It situates Islamophobia as the primary vehicle of contemporary Holocaust-like dynamics, while antisemitism persists as the explanatory myth that “justifies” the system.

## 🧩 Structural Outline  

### 1. Post-9/11 Identity Architecture  
- “War on Terror” as civilisational schema  
- Demographic fears and securitised citizenship  
- Islamophobia as political adhesive

### 2. Great Replacement as Framework  
- Muslims cast as demographic threat  
- Jews framed as orchestrators → antisemitic glue  
- Multi-group elimination logic

### 3. Policing, Migration, and Surveillance  
- Counter-terror laws weaponised as racial tools  
- Border securitisation as proto-fascist architecture  
- Prevent-style frameworks and metadata profiling

### 4. Axis of Blame  
- Muslims/Black/queer communities as targets  
- Jews as guilty by both proximity to power and imagined conspiracy  
- How fascism repeats but rotates its primary victim
