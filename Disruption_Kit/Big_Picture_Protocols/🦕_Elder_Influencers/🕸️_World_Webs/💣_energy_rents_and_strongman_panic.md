*How Putin‚Äôs reliance on oil and gas rents shaped power consolidation and fuels recurrent insecurity.*

## Summary  
This node examines how the collapse of the USSR, the sudden rise of oligarchic oil barons, and the consolidation of Gazprom and other rent streams under state control created the architecture of Putin‚Äôs rule. It maps key public incidents (Yukos, Nord Stream, post-2022 sanctions) to show why the Kremlin treats energy threats as existential ‚Äî and why that produces both calculated coercion and panic-style overreach.

## Historical Arc

### 1990s: Post-Soviet collapse and oligarch rise  
- Privatisation created a new oligarch class, many tied to oil and gas.  
- These families gained disproportionate leverage, filling the vacuum of Soviet central planning.  
- Society was accustomed to a single figurehead; oligarchs filled that role collectively until Putin re-centred it in himself.

### Early 2000s: Consolidation through alliances and coercion  
- **Khodorkovsky / Yukos (2003):** Arrest and dismantling of Yukos after moves toward independence and funding of opposition. Message: oligarch wealth survives only under loyalty to the Kremlin.  
- Gazprom positioned as both national champion and Kremlin patronage vehicle; energy rents became regime lifeblood.  

### 2010s: Pipeline politics and strategic leverage  
- **Nord Stream 1 & 2:** pipelines framed as tools of influence over Europe.  
- EU diversification and Ukraine‚Äôs westward turn seen as direct threats to Russia‚Äôs energy leverage.  
- Kremlin deepened asymmetric tools (cyber, disinformation) to offset structural energy vulnerabilities.

### 2022‚Äìpresent: Shock and isolation  
- Sanctions and Europe‚Äôs rapid energy diversification collapsed long-standing markets.  
- Moscow‚Äôs revenue stream destabilised, producing both aggressive signalling (airspace incursions, nuclear rhetoric) and compensatory diplomacy toward China, India, and the Global South.  
- Internal paranoia escalated: purges, elite defections, and tighter control of Gazprom/energy rents.

## Why energy is treated as existential
1. **Revenue lifeline:** Budgetary dependence on oil/gas rents funds the state and buys elite loyalty.  
2. **Geopolitical lever:** Pipelines and supply control double as foreign-policy weapons.  
3. **Regime glue:** Oligarch bargains hinge on the state‚Äôs control of resource rents.  
4. **Psychological anchor:** For Putin, shaped by KGB/Stalinist control culture, energy is the one lever he believes cannot be surrendered.

## Panic dynamics of strongman rule
- Strongmen consolidate power by monopolising rents.  
- Over time, they cannibalise their own networks, threatening or absorbing former allies.  
- Every rival (foreign pipelines, border controls, alternative suppliers) is treated as existential ‚Äî producing overshoot and volatility.  
- The result: a system that appears strong externally but is internally fragile, hypersensitive, and prone to ‚Äúpanic moves‚Äù when control feels threatened.

---

## Analytical take
Energy rents explain why:  
- Russia invests heavily in asymmetric disruption (nudging, cyber, disinformation) when energy leverage looks weakened.  
- Kremlin responses often look like both strategy and panic ‚Äî strategic in preserving rents, panic in their disproportionate intensity.  
- Putin‚Äôs system exemplifies the strongman paradox: centralisation produces apparent stability, but over time it erodes itself through paranoia and overreach.
