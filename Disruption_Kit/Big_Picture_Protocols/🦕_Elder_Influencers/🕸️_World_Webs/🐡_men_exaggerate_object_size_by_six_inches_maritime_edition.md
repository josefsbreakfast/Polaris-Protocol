# 🐡 Men Exaggerate Object Size by Six Inches (Maritime Edition)  
**First created:** 2025-11-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-09  
*A Polaris comedic-anthropological analysis of why sailors consistently exaggerated the size of sea creatures, ship damage, threats, and “things encountered at sea” — and how this behaviour helped create the Kraken myth.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Every woman on earth knows the ancient law:

> **Men add at least six inches to every size estimate.**

This law applies universally to:

- fish  
- danger  
- success  
- failures  
- penises  
- and sea monsters.

This node explains how masculine estimation bias + alcohol + maritime conditions + storytelling culture = a centuries-long epidemic of Kraken sightings.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Links exaggeration bias to the creation of maritime monsters.  
- Explains why sailors were uniquely prone to size inflation.  
- Shows how exaggerated stories became political and mythic tools.  
- Uses humour as cultural analysis and narrative deconstruction.  
- Maps the pipeline from “normal squid” → “colossal beast.”

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 🧍‍♂️ 1. The Fundamental Principle  
Men do **not** see things as they are.  
Men see things as:

- bigger  
- more dramatic  
- more dangerous  
- more impressive  
- more important  
- more “historic”  

This is especially true when:

- there are other men around,  
- there is alcohol involved,  
- reputation is at stake,  
- boredom is crushing,  
- and the story needs to be good.

Maritime conditions strongly favour all of the above.  
<!--Men are also terrible gossips, overly emotional, and can't admit to any of this. Add being sealed inside a tin can for a few months. Only the strong survive. Give them a little squid mythos.-->

### 🌊 2. Maritime Amplification Factors  
Sailors suffer from:

- poor lighting  
- storm-blown perspective distortion  
- adrenaline  
- fear  
- rum  
- exhaustion  
- competitive storytelling  
- emotional deprivation  
- cramped quarters  
- needing *something* to talk about  

These produce **chronic object inflation disorder**.

### 🐙 3. How a Normal Little Squid Becomes a Man-Eating Giga-Charged Kraken  
The Maritime Inflation Pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Small squid seen"] --> B["Size misjudged in storm"]
    B --> C["Rum consumed"]
    C --> D["Story told to crew"]
    D --> E["Crew adds 6 inches each retelling"]
    E --> F["Officer reports 'large sea creature'"]
    F --> G["Historian records Kraken encounter"]
```

This process accounts for at least **75%** of Kraken lore  
(and 100% of men’s personal anecdotes).

### ⚓ 4. Why Men Do This (Not Your Grandmother's Marriage Advice)  
Men exaggerate size because of:

- social bonding  
- hierarchy signalling  
- fear-masking  
- boredom  
- masculinity performance  
- survival storytelling  
- desire not to look foolish  
- the need for narrative control  
- prestige rituals  

Telling the truth (“it was probably a log”) undermines all these functions.

So the lie persists — with enthusiasm.

---

### 🏴‍☠️ 5. How Exaggerated Stories Became Institutional Truth  
Once an exaggeration enters the logbook:

- it becomes “primary evidence”  
- it is cited by naturalists  
- it appears in naval reports  
- it becomes proof for more funding  
- politicians reference it  
- poets inflate it further  
- the public believes it  
- future sailors expect it  
- the myth becomes “real”  

This is how men lying about size changed world folklore.

---

### 🚀 6. Contemporary Parallels  
The same size-exaggeration logic appears in:

- defence spending  
- threat modelling  
- police risk categories  
- political speeches  
- tabloid headlines  
- military procurement documents  
- every man explaining “how big the fish was”  
- Trident renewal paperwork  
- the Department of Defence’s “threat envelopes”  

Exaggeration is an **institutional behaviour**, not personal flaw.  

---

### 🪞 7. Why Polaris Takes This Seriously  
Because size-exaggeration narratives are:

- tools for power  
- sources of myth-making  
- political cover for budgets  
- reputational shields  
- emotional compensation structures  
- narrative inflation engines  

The Kraken did not exist.

But the *emotional incentives* behind describing a squid as “absolutely massive” absolutely did — and still do.
