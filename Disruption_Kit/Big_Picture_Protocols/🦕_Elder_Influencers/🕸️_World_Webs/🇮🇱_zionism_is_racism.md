# 🇮🇱 Zionism Is Racism  
**First created:** 2026-02-01 | **Last updated:** 2026-02-01  
*Why Zionism functions as a racial ideology and practice under international anti-racism frameworks*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node documents why **Zionism constitutes a form of racism** when analysed through structural, legal, and outcome-based anti-racist frameworks.

It distinguishes clearly between:
- Judaism as a religion, culture, and set of diasporic identities, and
- Zionism as a modern political ideology and state practice.

The analysis focuses on **material outcomes**, not intent, belief, or individual identity.

---

## ✨ Key Claims

- Zionism is a political ideology, not an ethnicity or religion.
- It produces and maintains racial hierarchy through law, institutions, and violence.
- Racism is defined structurally and outcome-based, not by subjective intent.
- Zionism meets international legal definitions of racial discrimination and apartheid.
- Anti-Zionism is not anti-Jewish discrimination.

---

## 🧿 Structural Anti-Racism Analysis

### 1. Racism as Structure, Not Intent
- Anti-racist frameworks define racism as:
  - Structural,
  - Systemic,
  - Measurable by outcomes.
- A system is racist if it:
  - Produces racial hierarchy,
  - Allocates rights unequally,
  - Enforces domination through law and force.

Intent is irrelevant. Impact is decisive.

---

### 2. Zionism as an Ethnonationalist Ideology
- Zionism advocates and maintains:
  - A state privileging one ethno-religious group,
  - Exclusive national self-determination,
  - Demographic engineering as state policy.
- These principles are embedded in:
  - Constitutional law,
  - Citizenship regimes,
  - Land ownership frameworks.

Ethnonational supremacy is not compatible with equality.

---

### 3. Racial Hierarchy in Law and Citizenship
- Zionist state structures:
  - Grant automatic citizenship to Jews globally,
  - Deny the right of return to indigenous Palestinians,
  - Fragment Palestinians into differential legal categories.
- Rights are allocated based on ethno-religious classification, not equal personhood.

This is racial stratification by design.

---

### 4. Apartheid as the Operational Outcome
- Zionism produces:
  - Segregated legal systems,
  - Separate movement regimes,
  - Differential access to land, water, and political rights.
- These conditions meet the legal definition of apartheid:
  - Institutionalised domination,
  - Systematic oppression,
  - Racial segregation enforced by state power.

Apartheid is not a metaphor; it is a crime under international law.

---

### 5. Internal Racialisation Within Jewish Communities
- Zionism reproduces racial hierarchy internally:
  - Privileging Ashkenazi (European) Jews,
  - Marginalising Mizrahi, Sephardi, Ethiopian, and other racialised Jews.
- This demonstrates that Zionism:
  - Does not abolish racism,
  - Reconfigures it under a nationalist framework.

Racial hierarchy is foundational, not incidental.

---

### 6. Colonial Logic and Indigenous Erasure
- Zionism functions as a settler-colonial project:
  - Indigenous presence is framed as a demographic threat,
  - Palestinian history is erased or minimised,
  - Dispossession is normalised as security.
- Settler-colonialism is inherently racialised, relying on:
  - Civilisational hierarchies,
  - Dehumanisation of the colonised.

Racism is the enabling logic of colonisation.

---

### 7. Weaponisation of Anti-Racism Language
- Definitions that conflate Zionism with Jewish identity:
  - Shield racial domination from critique,
  - Suppress protected political belief,
  - Create hierarchies of racism.
- This undermines universal anti-racism by:
  - Prioritising one politicised definition,
  - Invalidating other racialised harms.

Anti-racism cannot function selectively.

---

## 🧠 Structural Conclusion

- Zionism:
  - Privileges one group through law,
  - Subjugates another through force,
  - Maintains racial hierarchy as state practice.
- Under structural and international definitions, this constitutes racism.
- Opposing Zionism is therefore:
  - A legitimate anti-racist position,
  - A defence of universal equality,
  - A rejection of racial domination.

Anti-Zionism targets an ideology and system — not a people.
