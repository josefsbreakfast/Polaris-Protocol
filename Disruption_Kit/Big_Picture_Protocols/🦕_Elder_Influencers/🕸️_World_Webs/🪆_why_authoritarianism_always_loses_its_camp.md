*The structural reasons autocracies shed flamboyance, humour, spectacle, and charisma as they radicalise.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Authoritarianism is incompatible with camp — not immediately, but inevitably.  
Early in their lifecycle, regimes often produce theatrical, melodramatic, kitschy, even glamorous cultural output.  
But as they consolidate, paranoia rises, joy disappears, and the regime’s aesthetic narrows to greyscale severity.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  
### 1. Camp Requires Safety  
Camp needs irony, play, confidence, and an unafraid audience. Autocracies can’t sustain it long.

### 2. Paranoia Kills Play  
Humour becomes dangerous; theatricality becomes suspicious.

### 3. Cultural Producers Flee  
Camp dies when artists, musicians, dancers, comedians are pushed out.

### 4. The Camp Death Spiral  
Early regime: theatrical self-confidence  
Mid regime: managed kitsch  
Late regime: paranoia → purging of fun  
Final stage: bunker aesthetic
