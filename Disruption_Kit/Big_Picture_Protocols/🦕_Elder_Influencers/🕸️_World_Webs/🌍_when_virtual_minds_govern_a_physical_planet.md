# 🌍 When virtual minds govern a physical planet  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*How computational worldviews came to dominate governance — and why they fail when confronted with material reality.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node addresses a structural mismatch at the heart of contemporary governance:  
**systems shaped by computational abundance are now being used to govern a planet defined by physical scarcity.**

Decision-makers increasingly emerge from environments where:
- limits are abstract  
- resources feel infinite  
- failure is reversible  
- scale is cheap  
- replication costs nothing  

But the world being governed is not virtual.

Energy systems, medical infrastructure, food production, mineral extraction, nuclear safety, and climate stability are **material systems**. They obey physics, chemistry, biology, and geology — not software logic.

This node examines what happens when **virtual minds** are placed in charge of a **physical planet**.

## ✨ Key Features  

- Identifies computational abundance as a worldview, not just a toolset  
- Explains how software logic distorts perception of limits and risk  
- Traces why tech-led governance consistently underestimates material constraints  
- Connects digital optimism to growth ideology and substitution myths  
- Builds a bridge between applied science, degrowth, and governance failure

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Computational abundance as lived reality  

For several decades, a growing class of decision-makers has lived inside systems where:
- storage expands exponentially  
- processing power increases predictably  
- errors can be rolled back  
- environments can be simulated  
- scale is achieved through abstraction  

Within these systems, limits appear temporary.  
Constraints are framed as engineering challenges rather than boundaries.

This lived experience quietly becomes a **generalised worldview**:
> *If computing scaled this fast, everything else should too.*

That assumption is false — but it feels true to those who have never had it contradicted.

---

### 2. Virtual systems train false intuitions about risk  

In digital environments:
- failure is local  
- harm is rarely irreversible  
- damage is usually economic rather than physical  
- consequences are delayed or externalised  

This trains intuitions that:
- experimentation is always good  
- aggressive iteration is rational  
- worst-case scenarios are improbable  
- systems will stabilise post-hoc  

Physical systems behave differently.

When material systems fail:
- people die  
- environments are contaminated  
- resources are permanently lost  
- recovery spans generations  

The intuition gap is not small — it is catastrophic.

---

### 3. The collapse of material accounting  

Virtualised governance tends to treat the planet as:
- a substrate for optimisation  
- an input to economic models  
- a backdrop for growth narratives  

This leads to systematic underweighting of:
- depletion rates  
- declining ore grades  
- thermodynamic costs  
- maintenance burdens  
- ecological feedback loops  

When physical reality contradicts projections, the response is often disbelief rather than revision.

The model is defended.  
The world is blamed.

---

### 4. Why substitution myths thrive in virtual cultures  

Software teaches that:
- components are modular  
- functions can be swapped  
- dependencies can be abstracted away  

This logic is misapplied to material systems.

In reality:
- helium is not interchangeable  
- copper cannot be virtualised  
- oil is not infinitely replaceable  
- soil cannot be rebuilt on demand  
- ecosystems do not reboot  

Substitution works in code.  
It fails in matter.

Virtual minds consistently overestimate how transferable their problem-solving tools are.

---

### 5. Governance failure as epistemic failure  

The recurring crises of the last half-century — financial, ecological, infrastructural — share a pattern:
- confidence outruns material analysis  
- growth assumptions override constraints  
- abstraction replaces stewardship  

These failures are often framed as political or moral.

They are also **epistemic**.

The wrong kind of knowledge is being privileged for the task at hand.

Running a planet requires:
- systems thinking grounded in physics  
- respect for non-negotiable limits  
- long-term maintenance logic  
- humility before irreversible processes  

Virtual systems do not train for this.

---

### 6. Degrowth as re-materialisation of governance  

From this perspective, degrowth is not an ideology of less — it is an **epistemic correction**.

It reasserts that:
- economies exist within ecosystems  
- computation does not annul physics  
- optimisation cannot exceed carrying capacity  
- governance must start from material truth  

Degrowth asks virtual minds to re-enter the physical world — not to abandon technology, but to place it back within its proper domain.
