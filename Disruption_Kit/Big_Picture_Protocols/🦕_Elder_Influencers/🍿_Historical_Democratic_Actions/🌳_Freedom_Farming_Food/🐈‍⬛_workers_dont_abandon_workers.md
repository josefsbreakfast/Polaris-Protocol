*Why excluding farmers from “worker” politics was a strategic error — and how it enabled capture.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

There is a persistent fracture in left and Marxist-adjacent discourse that has never been properly resolved:

**farming is treated as an anomaly rather than labour.**

As a result, people who:
- work long hours,
- carry uninsurable risk,
- do not control the value of their output,
- and are structurally exposed to market shocks,

are rhetorically nudged outside the category of “workers.”

This has not harmed farming elites.  
It has harmed **working farmers** — and weakened worker politics more broadly.  

Farmers do not live on the traditional binary of "owner" of means of production, vs "labourer" who creates capital under ownership; praxis must respresent *who farmers are*, not what they may be under classification systems not-yet-decolonised.

## 🧿 What we mean by “worker” here  

For the purposes of this node:

> A worker is anyone who does not control the full value of their labour  
> and must continue working in order to survive.

By that definition:
- tenant farmers are workers,  
- family farmers under price pressure are workers,  
- smallholders locked into debt and supply chains are workers,  

even if:
- they own tools,
- they hold land on paper,
- or their assets look “large” from the outside.

Ownership of *means* does not equal ownership of *outcomes*.

## 🌾 The farming blind spot  

Classic industrial labour models prioritised:
- wage labour,
- factory settings,
- clear employer–employee relations.

Farming doesn’t fit neatly into that frame.

As a result, farming was often:
- treated as petit bourgeois,
- framed as “aspirational ownership,”
- or dismissed as politically ambiguous.

This misclassification ignored reality:
- price is set elsewhere,
- risk is socialised downward,
- debt disciplines behaviour,
- and exit is often impossible.

Farmers do not sit outside capitalism.  
They sit **under** it.

---

## 🧠 How this enabled conservative capture  

When left movements failed to recognise farmers as workers, a vacuum opened.

Conservative and reactionary actors stepped in by offering:
- cultural recognition,
- dignity of work narratives,
- and protection rhetoric (even when policy didn’t match).

This was not ideological magic.  
It was **basic solidarity being withheld** — and then supplied elsewhere.

Once that happens, alliances harden.

---

## ⚖️ Same stakes, different surface  

Working farmers and other workers share core conditions:
- loss of price-setting power,
- exposure to external shocks,
- downward pressure from consolidation,
- and moral injury when survival conflicts with ethics.

The difference is not stakes.  
It’s *visibility*.

When worker politics excludes food producers, it excludes the material base of survival itself.

That is not radical.  
It is self-defeating.

---

## 🧩 Why this fracture matters now  

In periods of stress:
- climate volatility,
- food price shocks,
- land consolidation,
- and aggressive enforcement,

farmers are pushed into overt political action.

If worker movements respond with suspicion or distance, they repeat the error.

Solidarity that stops at sectoral aesthetics is not solidarity.  
It is branding.

---

## ⚠️ The cost of abandonment  

When workers abandon workers:
- movements fragment,
- elites arbitrage the divide,
- and pressure is displaced downward.

This is how:
- food producers get isolated,
- enforcement gets normalised,
- and legitimacy fractures widen.

History is clear on this point.

---

## 🧩 Re-grounding solidarity  

A worker politics that survives the coming decades must:
- include food producers,
- understand land-based labour,
- and resist false binaries between “owner” and “worker.”

Because when food systems fail,  
*everyone* becomes a worker again — just without leverage.
