# 🚜 Tools Are Not Costumes

*When the state criminalises the means of participation, it isn’t “public safety” — it’s civic filtering.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Some protests are policed by debating the message.  
Others are policed by quietly removing the **body** — by criminalising the tool, the route, the outfit, the object that makes the protest possible.

For farmers, that object is the tractor.

A tractor is not a prop. It is:
- a work tool,
- a workplace,
- a symbol that is functional (not theatrical),
- and often the only practical way to move as a group from rural places into civic space.

So when police treat tractors as an inherent problem — rather than managing them — what they are really policing is not disorder, but **identity**.

## 🧿 The move: turn “who you are” into “what you did wrong”  

The **Met Police tractor ban** around the November 2025 Budget Day protests was framed as conditions to allow the demonstration while preventing tractors/agricultural vehicles entering Whitehall.  [oai_citation:0‡Farmers Guardian](https://www.farmersguardian.com/news/4522371/breaking-news-budget-day-protest-doubt-police-issue-tractor-ban?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
Arrests then followed for allegedly **refusing to comply with imposed conditions**, with reporting explicitly noting that the conditions involved tractors/agricultural vehicles.  [oai_citation:1‡Farmers Guardian](https://www.farmersguardian.com/news/4522362/live-updates-police-arrest-farmers-bringing-tractors-protest?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

This is a classic modern tactic:

- Don’t argue with the grievance  
- Don’t ban the protest outright  
- Impose conditions that target the **logistics**  
- Enforce the conditions and call it neutral  

It’s “you can protest, just not like *that*,” which often means: **not as yourselves**.

## ⚖️ What legal powers does this usually sit on?  

### 1) Conditions on protests: Public Order Act 1986 (s.12 / s.14)  
In England & Wales, the main framework for imposing conditions on protests is the **Public Order Act 1986**, including **s.12** (processions) and **s.14** (static assemblies).  [oai_citation:2‡Research Briefings](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05013/SN05013.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
These powers are routinely used to prescribe things like location, route, duration, and other restrictions — the “protest pen” logic.  [oai_citation:3‡Home | Green and Black Cross](https://greenandblackcross.org/guides/laws/section-12-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

FarmersGuardian’s reporting describes arrests as refusal to comply with “conditions.”  [oai_citation:4‡Farmers Guardian](https://www.farmersguardian.com/news/4522362/live-updates-police-arrest-farmers-bringing-tractors-protest?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
(Where police communications specify s.14, you often see it stated explicitly in similar policing contexts.)  [oai_citation:5‡The Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/met-police-arrests-pink-lady-migrant-canary-wharf-hotel-london-b1243374.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 2) “Obstruction” backstop: Highways Act 1980 (s.137)  
When the fight becomes physical space (roads, bridges, access routes), “wilful obstruction of the highway” under **s.137 Highways Act 1980** is the classic charge.  [oai_citation:6‡Legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/part/IX/crossheading/obstruction-of-highways-and-streets?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
It’s used across movements — from climate actions to road-based disruption — because it’s simple and spatial.  [oai_citation:7‡Supreme Court UK](https://supremecourt.uk/uploads/uksc_2019_0106_judgment_0bf6f93fde.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3) Newer protest offences/powers: Public Order Act 2023  
The CPS flags the **Public Order Act 2023** as adding specific protest-related offences and powers (including measures to assist policing of protests).  [oai_citation:8‡Crown Prosecution Service](https://www.cps.gov.uk/prosecution-guidance/offences-during-protests-demonstrations-or-campaigns?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Practical translation:** conditions (POA 1986) do the shaping; obstruction (Highways Act) does the clearing; newer protest law expands the toolkit.

## 🔎 Why tractors are targeted (and why it feels underhand)  

Because tractors do three things at once:

1) **They make the protest visible**  
A march looks like “a march.”  
A tractor convoy looks like **infrastructure** entering politics.

2) **They move rural people into civic space at scale**  
The tractor is the bridge between dispersed farms and concentrated government.

3) **They collapse the PR frame**  
It’s hard to portray a tractor as “symbolic disruption” when it is literally the symbol of work.

So the state tries to treat tractors as “threat objects” (danger, obstruction) rather than “work objects” (identity, livelihood). That reframing is what you clocked as underhand — because it’s not morally neutral, it’s a filter.

## 🇵🇸 Comparison: Palestine protests (UK)  

The policing pattern is similar: **conditions + enforcement + broad interpretive discretion**.

Liberty’s explainer on Palestine solidarity protests lists a menu of powers that show how quickly policing can shift from “manage” to “constrain,” including:
- Public Order Act 1986 offences (e.g., s.5 harassment/alarm/distress),
- breach of the peace (common law),
- dispersal powers,
- and more.  [oai_citation:9‡Liberty](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/explainer-palestine-protests/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

More recently, reporting has described criticism of the Met for citing “cumulative disruption” reasoning even after related regulations were quashed by the Court of Appeal (May 2025), raising concerns about legal basis and overreach.  [oai_citation:10‡The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/20/met-using-outdated-powers-to-police-pro-palestine-protests-say-legal-experts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
And we’re seeing arrests and enforcement attention pivot onto language/slogans as well as space.  [oai_citation:11‡The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/17/met-police-gmp-crackdown-intifada-chants-pro-palestine-protests?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Parallel:**  
- Farmers: “You can protest, but not with tractors.”  [oai_citation:12‡Farmers Guardian](https://www.farmersguardian.com/news/4522371/breaking-news-budget-day-protest-doubt-police-issue-tractor-ban?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Palestine: “You can protest, but not *there*, not *like that*, and sometimes not with *those words*.”  [oai_citation:13‡Liberty](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/explainer-palestine-protests/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## ♀️ Comparison: women’s protest and #MeToo-era demonstrations  

A clean UK reference point here is the **Sarah Everard vigil** and related women’s organising.

The policing of the Clapham Common vigil drew major scrutiny, including an official inspectorate report.  [oai_citation:14‡hmicfrs.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk](https://hmicfrs.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/publication-html/inspection-metropolitan-police-services-policing-of-vigil-commemorating-sarah-everard-clapham-common/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
Reclaim These Streets’ legal challenge later resulted in a High Court finding that police acted unlawfully in preventing organisers from holding a vigil, because they failed to properly consider Articles 10 and 11 (expression/assembly).  [oai_citation:15‡lag.org.uk](https://www.lag.org.uk/article/212477/met-police-violated-human-rights-in-thwarting-reclaim-these-streets-vigil?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
A civil claim also ended in damages relating to arrest/fixed penalty context connected to Covid regulations.  [oai_citation:16‡Bhatt Murphy](https://bhattmurphy.co.uk/newsroom/metropolitan-police-pay-10000-in-damages-to-a-woman-arrested-at-the-sarah-everard-vigil/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Parallel:**  
- Women’s protests: grief + safety + public space → policed through “regulations” and procedure.  [oai_citation:17‡hmicfrs.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk](https://hmicfrs.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/publication-html/inspection-metropolitan-police-services-policing-of-vigil-commemorating-sarah-everard-clapham-common/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Farmers: livelihood + food infrastructure → policed through “conditions” and procedure.  [oai_citation:18‡Farmers Guardian](https://www.farmersguardian.com/news/4522371/breaking-news-budget-day-protest-doubt-police-issue-tractor-ban?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

In both cases, the public doesn’t experience it as neutral enforcement.  
They experience it as the state insisting on paperwork while people try to speak in the only language they’ve got: bodies, objects, presence.

## 🧠 The deeper pattern: civic space gets “middle-classified”  

When tools-of-work are treated as illegitimate in protest:
- rural workers are filtered out,
- disabled or mobility-limited protesters are filtered out,
- trade-based collective action is filtered out,
- anyone whose protest requires equipment is filtered out.

The permitted protest becomes:
- foot-based,
- symbol-light,
- easily penned,
- and culturally “tidy.”

This is not only a policing choice.  
It becomes a democratic design choice — without anyone admitting they redesigned democracy.

*🚜 Tools Are Not Costumes* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents a recurring containment method: restricting civic participation by criminalising the equipment and logistics that make certain groups publicly legible.
