# 🫛 Why Community Gardens Get Pre-Crimed

*How small-scale food autonomy triggers modern surveillance, risk logic, and political anxiety.*

## 1. Overview  
Community gardens should be the **least suspicious places on earth**:  
- beans,  
- compost,  
- pensioners with secateurs,  
- a fox passing judgment.  

Yet in 2025 they are routinely treated as:  
- “unregulated gatherings,”  
- “potential radicalisation hubs,”  
- “resource distribution anomalies,”  
- “risk environments.”

This node explains **why community gardens get pre-crimed** in modern risk-governance systems — not because they are dangerous, but because they **break the logic of scarcity, dependency, and data visibility** that the system quietly depends on.

## 2. The Threat of Unmonitored Abundance  

### 2.1. Food Without Profit  
When a community grows its own food:

- no supermarket tills,  
- no loyalty card data,  
- no profit chain,  
- no scarcity narrative.

The system is built around **food as commodity**, not food as commons.  
A tomato grown outside the market is:

> **a breach in the economic perimeter.**

### 2.2. Calories That Cannot Be Modeled  
Data-poor food production means:

- no purchase history,  
- no algorithmic sentiment inference from goods bought,  
- no behavioural prediction from staples consumed.

A garden is a **data void**, and data voids cause anxiety in systems oriented to predictability.

### 2.3. Contained Scarcity Gets Leaky  
Governments reliant on carefully managed scarcity (cost-of-living, welfare sanctions, supply chain dependency) dislike **autonomous abundance**.

A garden is a:

- leak,  
- breach,  
- unlicensed granary.

## 3. The Pre-Crime Paradigm: Why Risk Systems Flag Gardens  

### 3.1. Collective Action Without Permission  
Gardens gather:

- neighbours,  
- strangers,  
- retirees,  
- students,  
- activists,  
- tenants,  
- kids.

Unmonitored collective action is intrinsically suspicious in a pre-crime framework because:

- it is offline,  
- unpredictable,  
- not mediated by institutional gatekeepers.

### 3.2. Cross-Class / Cross-Demographic Mixing  
Risk frameworks hate environments where:

- age groups mix,  
- class divides blur,  
- ethnicities interact freely,  
- social capital grows outside official channels.

In safeguarding logic, “mixed, unmonitored community spaces” automatically trip risk heuristics.

### 3.3. The Absence of a Central Authority  
No:

- formal convenor,  
- official safeguarding lead,  
- institution to take liability,  
- surveillance infrastructure.

Which means the system has no one to **hold responsible** if something happens — and therefore flags the space as risky.

### 3.4. Gardens Look Like Pre-Existing Radical Movements  
Historically, authorities have surveilled:

- allotments (miners’ strikes),  
- co-operatives,  
- mutual aid networks,  
- food-sharing circles,  
- anti-austerity kitchens,  
- squatter gardens,  
- land-back projects.

So the mental map of “grassroots food production = potential radical organising” already exists.

## 4. Food Sovereignty as a Quiet Threat  

### 4.1. Autonomy Undermines Compliance  
If people can feed themselves without:

- supermarkets,  
- landlords,  
- welfare payments,  
- conditionality,

…their vulnerability decreases.

Systems that rely on **dependency** for behaviour-shaping find food sovereignty threatening.

### 4.2. Mutual Aid Breaks the Scarcity Narrative  
Scarcity must be experienced individually to feel real.  
A garden is collective abundance.  
Abundance is politically dangerous.

### 4.3. “Too Much Free Food” Looks Like Radicalisation  
In 2025 risk logic:

- free meals,  
- mutual kitchens,  
- crop swaps,  
- seed exchanges…

…are read as:

- “incentivisation,”  
- “trust building,”  
- “recruitment behaviour.”

Even when the only thing being recruited is **slug patrol**.

## 5. Data Governance: Why Gardens Confuse the Machine  

### 5.1. Behaviour Without Digital Correlates  
Most modern risk systems map people through:

- purchases,  
- location traces,  
- digital engagement,  
- welfare interactions.

A community garden produces:

- calories,  
- relationships,  
- belonging,

…**none of which leave digital footprints**.

### 5.2. Positive Social Indicators Look “Outlier-ish”  
Strong ties, mutual support, resilience, collective labour —  
qualities desired by communities but statistically coded as:

- “unusual clustering,”  
- “parallel networks,”  
- “non-institutional organising.”

These get misread as **pre-associative networks**.

### 5.3. The Machine Cannot Parse Joy  
Algorithms fed on crime, deprivation, compliance, and risk struggle to interpret:

- joy,  
- care,  
- solidarity,  
- beans.

The system is not calibrated to recognise “community thriving” as non-threatening.

## 6. The Political Reason: Gardens Point to Government Failure  

### 6.1. They Provide What the State Withheld  
A garden is living evidence that:

- public services are failing,  
- welfare is insufficient,  
- food systems are broken.

Every carrot is a **rebuke**.

### 6.2. Gardens Reveal False Scarcity  
When people see food literally **growing out of the ground**, it undermines:

- supermarket narratives of inflation,  
- government helplessness,  
- corporate necessity,  
- austerity inevitability.

### 6.3. The Threat of Demonstrated Competence  
Competent communities delegitimise the “there is no alternative” mantra.

A thriving community garden says:

> “We can govern ourselves better than you govern us.”

That’s threatening.

## 7. Why They Really Get Pre-Crimed: The Equation  

The unspoken logic:
