# 🥔 Why States Starve Us When There Is Enough  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*Why artificial scarcity emerges in systems of plenty, and how risk-governance quietly normalises hunger.*

## 1. Overview  
This node explores **why people are going hungry in systems where there is enough food** — enough calories, enough arable land, enough logistics capacity — yet **subsistence is unstable and conditional**.

It argues that:

- Most contemporary hunger in rich states is **politically and structurally produced**, not a failure of absolute supply.  
- Modern states are governed by **risk, optics, and market dogma**, not by a duty to feed.  
- As a result, they routinely **tolerate or generate hunger** even when food is abundant, because hunger now functions as:  
  - a **behavioural disciplining tool**,  
  - a **market stabiliser**, and  
  - a **by-product of algorithmic governance**.

We starve in the shadow of full granaries because the system optimises for **predictability and profit**, not for **enoughness**.

## 2. From Duty to Feed → Freedom to Let Starve  

### 2.1. Loss of Custodial Ethic  
Historically, many states carried an implicit or explicit ethic that **rulers owe their people bread**:

- Grain reserves, public granaries, rationing, price caps.  
- Political crises when bread ran out (bread riots, revolutions).  

In contemporary neoliberal democracies, this ethic has been eroded and replaced by:

- “The market will provide.”  
- “Personal responsibility for budgeting.”  
- “The state’s duty is to regulate, not to supply.”

The shift is subtle but devastating:

> **The state no longer sees hunger as its failure — only as a regrettable outcome of individual circumstances and market conditions.**

### 2.2. Legal Silence on Positive Duties  
Human rights frameworks often articulate **freedom from torture, arbitrary detention, and discrimination** more clearly than they articulate **a right to material subsistence**.

Where the right to food exists on paper, enforcement is weak; there is rarely a **clear, enforceable duty** on the state to:

- ensure affordable staples,  
- control profiteering,  
- maintain strategic reserves for civilians,  
- intervene against predatory pricing.

This legal ambiguity allows political actors to **normalise hunger as unfortunate but lawful**.

## 3. Market Logic: Scarcity as a Feature, Not a Bug  

### 3.1. Profitable Scarcity  
In consolidated food systems (supermarket oligopolies, global commodity traders):

- Prices can be kept **artificially high** via logistics bottlenecks, branding, and speculative trading.  
- Wastage and overproduction sit next to food banks and hunger.  
- “Just-in-time” supply chains prioritise efficiency over resilience.

Scarcity is not a failure; it is **built into the profit model**:

- Higher margins on “value” food during crises.  
- Premium niches for “ethical” food while basic staples are squeezed.  
- Rent extraction through land, storage, and distribution chokepoints.

### 3.2. State Capture and Policy Inertia  
When **food and retail lobbies** are closely entangled with political parties:

- Anti-monopoly action is weak.  
- Price controls are framed as “market interference.”  
- Welfare uprates lag behind inflation by design, not accident.

States will often **tolerate preventable hunger** rather than confront:

- supermarket chains,  
- agribusiness conglomerates,  
- landlord and logistics lobbies.

---

## 4. Risk Governance: Hunger as Behavioural Discipline  

### 4.1. From Safety Net to Sanctions Regime  
Modern welfare systems are increasingly built around:

- **conditionality** (“prove you deserve help”),  
- **sanctions** (“we remove your income if you do not comply”),  
- **behavioural nudges** (job search, training, “activation”).

When benefits are removed or delayed:

- Rent, food, and utilities become **directly contingent on compliance**.  
- Hunger functions as a **silent enforcement tool**.

The state does not have to **actively starve** anyone.  
It simply **designs rules knowing** that failure to comply often means **you will not eat**.

### 4.2. Algorithmic Triage  
Automated systems now:

- flag “fraud risk”,  
- freeze payments,  
- misclassify people as ineligible,  
- apply sanctions at scale.

In practice:

- glitches and false positives = sudden income loss,  
- Kafkaesque appeals processes = prolonged food insecurity.

The machine can starve thousands while **no individual official ever touches the lever.**  
The hunger is “nobody’s fault” — it belongs to **the system**.

---

## 5. Predictability, Control, and Why Scarcity is “Convenient”  

### 5.1. Scarcity Makes People More Predictable  
Under pressure:

- people narrow their choices,  
- focus on immediate survival,  
- become more risk-averse,  
- reduce experimentation and dissent.

For systems obsessed with stability, this is **desirable**:

- scarce resources → constrained behaviour → easier modelling.  
- those who “step out of line” are visibly desperate and discreditable.  

### 5.2. Hunger as a Quiet Deterrent  
Knowing that hunger awaits if you fall out of:

- employment,  
- bureaucratic compliance,  
- “acceptable” risk categories…

…works as a **silent threat**.

You do not need secret police if:

- people police themselves to avoid falling into the food bank queue.

Hunger becomes **a diffuse instrument of control** embedded in every policy that refuses to guarantee enough.

## 6. How States Justify Starving People in a World of Plenty  

### 6.1. Narrative Frames  
To live with the contradiction (“we have enough food” / “some people can’t eat”), states deploy contagious narratives:

- “Personal responsibility / budgeting.”  
- “Welfare dependency / benefits culture.”  
- “Fraud and abuse.”  
- “Tough choices in hard times.”  
- “We must not distort the market.”  
- “Inflation is an unfortunate global issue.”

These stories offload blame onto:

- individuals,  
- external shocks,  
- abstract markets,  
- previous governments.

### 6.2. Moral Numbing  
When hunger is:

- spatially segregated (poor neighbourhoods, detention centres, camps),  
- administratively framed (sanctions, “non-compliance”),  
- medicalised (malnutrition as “lifestyle”),  
- charity-ised (food banks instead of rights),

…it becomes easier for officials, professionals, and voters to **not feel** the violence.

Hunger is there, but it is **out of narrative scope**.

## 7. It’s Not Just “Control”: The Structural Feedback Loop  

It’s tempting to say: *“states starve us because they want control.”*  
The fuller picture is a feedback loop:

1. **Neoliberal market logic** prioritises profit and efficiency over resilience and universal access.  
2. **Risk governance** prioritises stability, prediction, and liability management.  
3. **Algorithmic tools** reward compressed behaviour ranges and penalise unpredictability.  
4. **Welfare architectures** use sanctions and conditionality as default management tools.  
5. **Political narratives** blame individuals, not structures.  

Together, these produce a regime where:

> **Hunger is an acceptable side-effect of how the system optimises itself.**

The granary is not empty.  
It is **locked behind code, policy, and price** — and the system considers that normal.

## 8. What This Means for Resistance  

This node underpins the wider **🥨 Bread No Roses** folder:

- Hunger in 2025 is a **political instrument**, not just a humanitarian emergency.  
- Actions that interact with food (consumption strikes, supply chain blockades, anti-sanction campaigns, supermarket pressure, mutual aid kitchens) are **core democratic tactics**, not charity.  
- Exposing the **granary logic** — showing where food is overabundant while people starve — is central to **countering the legitimacy of risk-governance**.

Any serious attempt to rebuild democracy in conditions of plenty has to:

- reassert a **duty to feed**,  
- treat hunger as a **governance failure**,  
- and refuse to accept **artificial scarcity** as inevitable.

**Why States Starve Us When There Is Enough** is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, analysing how modern democracies normalise hunger in conditions of abundance. It traces the convergence of market logic, risk governance, and algorithmic control that makes artificial scarcity appear rational, and situates food insecurity as a central mechanism of contemporary containment.
