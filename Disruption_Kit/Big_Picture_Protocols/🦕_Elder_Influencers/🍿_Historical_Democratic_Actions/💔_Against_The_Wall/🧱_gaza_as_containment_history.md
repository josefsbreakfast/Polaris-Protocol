# 🧱 Gaza as Containment: Displacement, Walls, and the Long Arc of Closure  
**First created:** 2026-01-01 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-01  
*How forced displacement, enclosure, and securitisation produced Gaza as a site of permanent containment*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node provides historical context for understanding Gaza not as an isolated conflict zone, but as the **product of staged displacement, enclosure, and progressive containment**.

It traces:
- how Gaza became a site of forced concentration following ethnic cleansing  
- how militarisation and securitisation intensified over time  
- how Palestinians have repeatedly attempted to leave Gaza — legally and physically  
- why the wall is not symbolic, but materially central to survival  
- why resistance has repeatedly focused on the barrier itself  

This is an overview node.  
It is not exhaustive, but it establishes **continuity**.

## 🧭 Gaza’s Formation: Forced Displacement (1947–1949)  

Gaza did not become densely populated through natural migration.

During the 1947–1949 period:
- Palestinians were forcibly displaced from **hundreds of villages and towns**  
- many were expelled from areas in what became southern Israel  
- Gaza, then under Egyptian administration, became a **refuge zone of last resort**

The majority of Gaza’s population descends from families displaced from:
- villages in the southern coastal plain  
- towns such as Jaffa, Ashkelon, Beersheba, and surrounding rural areas  
- an estimated **200+ depopulated localities**

This was not incidental movement.  
It was **mass displacement as part of ethnic cleansing**, later frozen in place.

From its origin, Gaza functioned as:
> a space where displaced people were *contained*, not resettled.

## 🏕️ From Refuge to Enclosure (1950s–1980s)  

Over subsequent decades:
- refugee camps became permanent  
- return was denied  
- borders hardened  
- mobility narrowed  

While Gaza was not yet fully sealed, it was:
- economically marginalised  
- politically managed  
- structurally dependent  

Palestinians in Gaza remained displaced people **without an exit**.

---

## 🧱 Securitisation and Closure (1990s–2007)  

The 1990s marked a decisive shift:
- movement increasingly controlled through permits  
- labour access restricted  
- borders formalised  
- infrastructure designed for separation  

Following 2005 and especially after 2007:
- Gaza was subjected to comprehensive closure  
- airspace, sea access, and land borders sealed  
- population registry and movement controlled externally  

This is when containment became **systemic and total**.

## 🚫 Life Under Closure: The Material Function of the Wall  

The wall and closure regime are not abstract.

They regulate:
- food quantities and categories  
- medical equipment  
- building materials  
- educational supplies  
- everyday items deemed “dual use”  

Over the years, restrictions have included bans on items as trivial as:
- spices  
- foodstuffs  
- basic household goods  

These restrictions were not about symbolism.  
They were about **governing life through scarcity**.

The wall is the mechanism that enforces this.

## 🚶 Attempts to Leave Gaza: A Repeated History  

Palestinians in Gaza have repeatedly attempted to leave:
- through legal crossings  
- through labour permits  
- through medical evacuation  
- through sea access  
- through mass protest  

Each attempt has been:
- restricted  
- delayed  
- criminalised  
- or violently suppressed  

The **Great March of Return (2018–2019)** was one such attempt — not an invasion, but a mass civilian approach asserting:
> the right to movement, return, and dignity

It was met with lethal force, including the killing of unarmed civilians.

---

## 🕊️ Resistance Focused on the Barrier  

Because the wall:
- enforces hunger  
- enforces immobility  
- enforces dependency  

it has repeatedly become the **focus of resistance**.

Groups opposing the wall — including joint Palestinian–Israeli formations — have treated it not merely as a symbol of apartheid, but as the **primary instrument of collective punishment**.

The wall is not a metaphor.  
It is the choke point.

## ⚔️ October 7 and the Logic of Escape (Contextualised Carefully)  

This node does **not** deny that war crimes occurred on October 7.

It does assert that:
- the operation known as *Al-Aqsa Flood* was viewed by Hamas, and many al-Nakba survivors and their descendants, as a **breach of containment**
- the wall was treated as the central obstacle to be overcome
- the logic was escape from permanent enclosure  

Understanding this does not excuse atrocities; it explains **why the wall remains the strategic and symbolic centre**.

Containment produces explosion.  

Notably, Hamas under the leadership of Yahya Sinwar were willing to undergo investigation for war crimes, subject to fair trial norms.  

If the West genuinely wanted to persue due process and justice, it would not use Jewish women's dead bodies as rhetorical capital, nor would it support the assasination of a willing party with command influence.

## 🧠 Analytical Through-Line  

From 1948 onward, Gaza has been:
1. a site of forced displacement  
2. a space of managed survival  
3. a laboratory of securitised enclosure  
4. a population denied exit  
5. a territory governed through walls  

Resistance has therefore consistently oriented toward:
> breaking containment, not conquering territory.

*🧱 Gaza as Containment* is a contextual node within **💔 Against The Wall**, situating contemporary resistance and repression within the long history of displacement, enclosure, and blocked mobility.

It exists to make clear that Gaza’s wall is not incidental — it is the organising structure of life and death.
