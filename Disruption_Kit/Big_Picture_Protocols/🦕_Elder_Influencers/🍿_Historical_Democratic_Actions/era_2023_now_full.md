# 🌪️ 2023–Now — The Legitimacy Crisis Era

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**2023–Now** is *The Reckoning*:  
Not justice, but the collapse of institutional credibility.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Public distrust becomes total  
- Authoritarian drift as containment  
- Economic exhaustion → political anger  
- Survivor logic becomes public logic  
- Institutions fear scrutiny more than accountability  

---

## 1. 2023 — Crisis Becomes Visible  
Public sees:  
- collapsing NHS  
- housing unaffordable  
- police misconduct  
- court delays  
- corruption stories  
- austerity fallout  

Trust collapses.

---

## 2. 2024 — Authoritarian Drift  
Governments try to contain:  
- anger  
- inequality  
- legitimacy collapse  

Tools:  
- protest restrictions  
- culture war scapegoating  
- “law and order” rhetoric  

But the anger is material, not ideological.

---

## 3. “Everyone Is Lying” Politics  
People stop believing official narratives.  
Truth comes from:  
- leaks  
- whistleblowers  
- investigations  
- survivor testimonies  

Not governments.

---

## 4. Post-Austerity Rage  
Decade+ of cuts created:  
- class disgust  
- economic trauma  
- moral injury  

People feel betrayed.

---

## 5. Elite Miscalculation  
Elites think:  
- public is distractible  
- denial still works  
- PR can repair anything  

Wrong.  
People expect scandal.

---

## 6. Emotional Landscape  
People feel:  
- exhausted  
- angry  
- alert  
- morally insulted  
- unwilling to pretend  

This is irreversible.
