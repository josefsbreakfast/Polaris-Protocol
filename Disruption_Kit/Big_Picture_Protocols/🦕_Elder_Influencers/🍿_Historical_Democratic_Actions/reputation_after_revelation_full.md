## 🛰️ Orientation  
The old “hide, minimise, contain” model no longer protects institutions.  
Post-2022, public anger + pattern literacy = new governance landscape.

Institutions must adapt or face collapse.

# 1. How Institutions Handled Safeguarding in 2022  
- containment  
- downscaling  
- delay  
- sanitised records  
- poor SAR responses  
- fear of litigation from accused, not concern for survivor  

They assumed the public would forget.

---

# 2. How Institutions Behave Now (2023–2025)  
Motivated by:  
- fear of retrospective review  
- FOI/SAR scrutiny  
- public distrust  
- legitimacy collapse  

Behaviours:  
- over-documentation  
- belated policy updates  
- panic audits  
- greater apparent transparency (performative)  

Institutions now fear the *public*, not survivors.

---

# 3. Why Reputation Management Collapsed  
Because the public now sees:  
- minimisation = guilt  
- missing records = cover-up  
- “threshold not met” = negligence  
- silence = complicity  

Patterns are too familiar.

# 4. What Institutions Must Do Now (Strategically, Not Morally)  

## 4.1 Acknowledge Failure Early  
“Reviewing,” “cooperating,” “recognising missed opportunities.”

## 4.2 Stop Hiding Behind Procedure  
Provide:  
- timelines  
- rationale  
- escalation logic  

## 4.3 Prepare for Retrospective Review  
Reconstruct records now to avoid inquiry consequences.

## 4.4 Fear Public Anger, Not Survivor Disruption  
The public has more power than any individual complainant.

## 4.5 Provide Full SARs  
Incomplete SARs = scandal risk.  
Transparency = reputation survival.

---

## 🏮 Conclusion  
Post-2022, the cost of concealment > cost of accountability.  
Institutions that fail to update their behaviour will face public and regulatory consequences.
