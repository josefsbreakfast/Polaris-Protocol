## 🛰️ Orientation  
**Predation Logic** maps how abusers select, target, groom, exploit, silence, and abandon victims.  
It is not about desire.  
It is not about impulse.  
It is not about “misunderstanding.”

Predation is:

- opportunistic  
- strategic  
- patterned  
- trained over time  
- shaped by past impunity  
- strengthened by institutional weakness  
- driven by power, not pleasure  

Survivors often blame themselves,  
because they were taught to evaluate the situation through morality.

Predators evaluate through **opportunity**.

This node explains the real mechanics.

# 1. Predation Is About Power, Not Attraction  
Most survivors ask:

- “Why me?”  
- “What did I do?”  
- “Was I chosen for something I did wrong?”  

The truth:

> **Predators do not pick the “special” one.  
They pick the *accessible* one.  
The unprotected one.  
The one who cannot fight back.**  

They choose based on:

- opportunity  
- risk calculation  
- likelihood of silence  
- expected institutional apathy  
- social vulnerability  
- isolation  

You were not “chosen.”  
You were **available in the predator’s risk model**.

---

# 2. The Predator’s Core Calculation: “Will I Get Away With It?”  
Predators assess four things:

### ✔ *Vulnerability* (can I overpower them socially/emotionally/physically?)  
### ✔ *Isolation* (are they alone? unsupported? misunderstood?)  
### ✔ *Credibility* (will people believe them?)  
### ✔ *Institutional Climate* (is this environment permissive?)  

This is not about who the survivor *is*.  
It is about what the predator *can do without consequence*.

This shift is crucial for survivor liberation.

# 3. The Three V’s: Why Predators Select Survivors  
Predators target along three broad axes:

### **1. Vulnerability**  
- youth  
- disability  
- poverty  
- immigration insecurity  
- illness  
- trauma  
- marginalisation  
- being new to a system  
- dependence  

### **2. Visibility Gap**  
People who are:

- overlooked  
- unheard  
- dismissed  
- disbelieved  
- inconvenient to systems  

### **3. Ventilation**  
People whose disclosure won’t spread because:

- their networks are thin  
- the institution is insulated  
- the predator has allies  

It is never about “desirability.”  
It is always about **access + silence + impunity**.

---

# 4. The Grooming Architecture  
Grooming is not an event.  
It is an architecture:

### ✔ Attachment  
Creating trust, attention, specialness.

### ✔ Dependency  
Positioning themselves as essential, supportive, irreplaceable.

### ✔ Isolation  
Reducing outside support or credibility.

### ✔ Testing  
Minor boundary violations to check compliance.

### ✔ Entrapment  
Escalation into irreversible harm while ensuring silence.

Grooming works because survivors are human, relational, and vulnerable — not because they are naive.

---

# 5. Institutional Predation  
Predation flourishes in systems that:

- ignore complaints  
- punish whistleblowing  
- rely on hierarchy  
- reward silence  
- discourage empathy  
- prioritise reputation over justice  
- minimise safeguarding failures  
- protect powerful people  

These environments make predation:

- easier  
- safer for the predator  
- more dangerous for the victim  
- harder to disclose  
- harder to escape  

Institutions create the conditions predators exploit.

---

# 6. The Predator’s Reward Loop  
Predators continue because:

- they got away with it last time  
- their environment protects them  
- victims were disbelieved  
- colleagues looked away  
- institutions minimised harm  
- accountability was avoided  
- they gained status instead of losing it  

Each escape from consequences **reinforces their belief**:

> “I can do this. Nothing will happen.”  

Reward shapes repeated behaviour.

---

# 7. Survivor Logic in Predatory Systems  
Survivors adapt in brilliant ways:

- reading danger quickly  
- sensing shifts in tone  
- avoiding certain corridors or hours  
- managing proximity  
- reducing vulnerability  
- controlling disclosure  
- building mental maps of safe people  

None of this is paranoia.  
It is **forced expertise** in survival.

---

# 8. Predation Is Not Personal  
This is often the hardest truth:

You were targeted *not because* of who you are,  
but because of:

- who the predator is  
- what the institution allowed  
- what vulnerability they perceived  
- what narrative they expected to control  
- what silence they assumed would follow  

Predation is not a compliment.  
It is not desire.  
It is not personal.

It is **a predator doing what predators do,  
inside a system that let them do it.**

---

# 9. Aftermath: How Predators Rewrite History  
After harm, predators deploy predictable reframes:

- “It was consensual.”  
- “They misunderstood.”  
- “They’re unstable.”  
- “They’re exaggerating.”  
- “They’re vengeful.”  
- “They’re confused.”  
- “They’re mistaken.”  
- “It wasn’t that bad.”  

This is not about truth.  
It is about **restoring control**.

The survivor’s credibility is always the first target.

---

# 10. Why Predation Logic Matters  
Understanding predation logic frees the survivor from:

- shame  
- self-blame  
- confusion  
- perceived complicity  
- misplaced guilt  
- internalised minimisation  
- the belief that they “should have known better”  

Predation is systematic.  
Patterns, not personal failings, explain what happened.

This gives back:

- dignity  
- clarity  
- narrative sovereignty  
- self-compassion  
- structural understanding  
- rightful anger  

Predation logic reframes the story  
in a way that points to responsibility —  
and it is never the survivor’s.
