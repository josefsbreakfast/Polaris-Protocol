# 🏛️ Neutralising Frankenstacks: Civil Service Guidance  
**A practical framework for departmental staff and senior officials for identifying, mitigating, and preventing accidental cross-system harm.**

_Last updated: 2025-11-16_

---

## 1. Purpose  
This document provides clear procedural guidance for identifying and addressing instances where multiple legacy systems, datasets, or behavioural tools may interact in unintended ways (“Frankenstack conditions”).  
The aim is to reduce inadvertent harm, improve data quality, restore procedural clarity, and maintain public trust.

---

## 2. Key Principles  

- **Unintentional Emergence:** Frankenstack conditions arise through systemic misalignment rather than deliberate design.  
- **Structural Responsibility:** Harmful outcomes typically result from process fragmentation, not individual negligence.  
- **Proportional Mitigation:** Departments should address misalignment with targeted interventions rather than broad system shutdowns.  
- **Transparency:** Where safe and appropriate, staff should provide clear explanations of process boundaries to service users.  
- **Risk Reduction:** Correct identification of system interplay reduces reputational, legal, and operational risk.

---

## 3. Indicators of Frankenstack Conditions  
Departments should monitor for:

- Contradictory outputs from separate systems handling the same case.  
- Repeated escalation without resolution (“infinite review loops”).  
- Staff uncertainty about system of record or authoritative dataset.  
- Inconsistent demographic or risk categorisation.  
- Legacy flags influencing current decision-making without review.  
- Behavioural nudges or safeguarding prompts triggering out of context.  
- Increased formality, delay, or avoidance behaviours at frontline level.  

These indicators suggest systemic misalignment requiring structured intervention.

---

## 4. Immediate Actions for Staff  

### 4.1 Acknowledge System Boundaries  
Staff should clearly communicate:
- which system they are using,  
- what information it contains,  
- and what its limitations are.

Avoid implying that all systems share the same data or context.

---

### 4.2 Reduce Duplication  
Where safe, avoid requiring repeated submission of identical information unless mandated by policy.  
Where duplication is unavoidable, provide rationale to service users.

---

### 4.3 Clarify Ownership  
If multiple teams are involved, establish which unit or individual holds primary responsibility for the next action.  
Record this ownership clearly in the case notes.

---

### 4.4 Mitigate Misinterpretation  
Where behavioural or sentiment-inference tools are in use, staff should avoid inferring intent, stability, or credibility from automated outputs.  
Human review is essential where digital interpretation may trigger escalation.

---

### 4.5 Maintain Consistent Tone  
Staff should adopt a neutral, courteous, and predictable communication style, recognising that inconsistency may increase distress for affected individuals.

---

## 5. Operational Steps for Team Leaders  

### 5.1 Conduct a Local Systems Map  
Identify:
- all platforms used in case handling,  
- their data sources,  
- update cycles,  
- and any known interoperability issues.

Highlight areas of potential conflict or duplication.

---

### 5.2 Review Legacy Risk Flags  
Implement a scheduled review of historical risk categories that may be automatically re-applied by outdated systems.  
Ensure expired or irrelevant flags are removed according to policy.

---

### 5.3 Establish a Single Point of Contact  
Where multiple teams contribute to a case, designate a single officer responsible for ensuring alignment across systems.  
This reduces fragmentation and prevents contradictory communication.

---

### 5.4 Escalate Structural Failures  
If misalignment appears systemic rather than case-specific, escalate to the relevant digital governance group or Chief Data Officer.  
Provide evidence of observed inconsistencies.

---

## 6. Recommended Department-Level Reforms  

### 6.1 Cross-System Auditing  
Departments should undertake periodic audits to identify:
- unintended data flows,  
- redundant pipelines,  
- risk inference tools operating outside intended parameters,  
- discrepancies between legacy and modern systems.

---

### 6.2 Minimum Standards for Risk Flags  
Develop a unified framework covering:
- flag creation,  
- retention periods,  
- read/write permissions,  
- review mechanisms,  
- cross-department portability,  
- and mandatory sunset dates.

---

### 6.3 Governance of Behavioural Tools  
Ensure all behavioural insight modules, sentiment analysis tools, and digital nudges undergo:
- impact assessment,  
- bias review,  
- and cross-system compatibility checks.

Suspend tools that create harmful interactions with safeguarding or HR systems.

---

### 6.4 Redress Route  
Create a clear mechanism allowing members of the public to request:
- review of data inaccuracies,  
- correction of misclassification,  
- removal of obsolete risk flags,  
- and clarification of system actions.

Target response time: **30 days**.

---

## 7. Summary for Senior Officials  
Frankenstack conditions represent:
- operational inefficiency,  
- data protection risk,  
- reputational exposure,  
- and avoidable harm to service users.

Mitigation requires:
- clear ownership,  
- structured auditing,  
- better interoperability,  
- and consistent communication.

Addressing these issues strengthens governance, improves service quality, and protects both staff and citizens.
