## 🛰️ Orientation  
**Crisis Absorption Logic** describes how governments under domestic strain use external atrocities, international emergencies, or distant violence to stabilise or delay their own legitimacy collapse.

This is not about fabricating crises.  
It is about **absorbing** them:

- politically  
- emotionally  
- rhetorically  
- institutionally  

A foreign crisis becomes:

- a distraction  
- a pressure valve  
- a unifying threat  
- a moral diversion  
- a shield against accountability  
- a way to regulate public attention  
- an opportunity to build political capital  
- a justification for domestic authoritarianism  

Crisis absorption is not conspiracy.  
It is governance opportunism in a failing system.

# 1. When Domestic Legitimacy Cracks  
Crisis absorption emerges when a government faces:

- falling trust  
- scandals  
- corruption exposure  
- failing public services  
- economic deterioration  
- internal factionalism  
- institutional rot  
- collapsing narratives  

These conditions produce political panic.

The state becomes desperate for a narrative strong enough to pull attention outward.

---

# 2. The Atrocity as Organising Principle  
External suffering becomes politically useful because:

- it is morally overwhelming  
- it creates a simplified narrative  
- it compresses public attention  
- it generates emotional absorption  
- it shifts scrutiny away from domestic failures  
- it offers a story of “leadership” in crisis  

The state displaces internal instability  
onto an external spectacle.

---

# 3. The Emotional Hijack  
Human beings cannot emotionally metabolise:

- widespread suffering  
- state violence  
- genocide  
- humanitarian collapse  
- international brutality  

The political class knows this.

External atrocities pull on:

- compassion  
- horror  
- guilt  
- fear  
- moral urgency  
- ideological identity  

This emotional overload indirectly stabilises the government because the public has:

- less bandwidth  
- less focus  
- less clarity  
- less energy for domestic accountability  

This is not public failure.  
It is **emotional triage** in a crisis-saturated world.

---

# 4. Crisis as a Legitimacy Buffer  
Crisis absorption allows the state to say:

- “Now is not the time for division.”  
- “We must stand together.”  
- “National unity is essential.”  
- “Security comes first.”  
- “Scrutiny undermines us.”  
- “This is bigger than politics.”  

This reframes:

- dissent → disloyalty  
- criticism → destabilisation  
- accountability → irresponsibility  

The absorption of crisis becomes a **temporary political shield**.

---

# 5. Institutional Uses of External Suffering  
Governments leverage external crises in ways that:

### ✔ Expand executive power  
Emergency rhetoric justifies bypassing scrutiny.

### ✔ Delay accountability processes  
Parliamentary inquiries stall under “national security concerns.”

### ✔ Silence internal whistleblowers  
“Not helpful at a time like this.”

### ✔ Rebuild public tolerance for austerity  
“Resources must be redirected.”

### ✔ Increase surveillance  
“Risk levels are elevated.”

### ✔ Reframe domestic anger  
The public is told their suffering is insignificant compared to the global scale.

Crisis absorption becomes a governance tool.

# 6. The Media as Amplifier  
Most media institutions are structurally compelled to follow:

- spectacle  
- suffering  
- urgency  
- moral polarisation  

An external atrocity provides:

- easy narratives  
- emotional clarity  
- continuous footage  
- simplified villains  
- reduced journalistic risk  

Domestic complexity is pushed down the stack.

The government benefits because the media’s attention economy aligns with crisis absorption.

---

# 7. The Public’s Psychological Triage  
When people are:

- exhausted  
- economically stressed  
- betrayed by institutions  
- politically homeless  
- emotionally depleted  

A large external crisis provides:

- clarity  
- emotional expression  
- a sense of moral direction  
- a space to place anger  
- something bigger than their own survival struggles  

People do not “fall for distraction.”  
They are **dragged into triage** by overwhelming events.

The government exploits this.

---

# 8. When Crisis Absorption Backfires  
Absorption fails when:

- the domestic collapse is too severe  
- the public no longer trusts any narrative  
- the atrocity is seen as politically manipulated  
- the suffering is too clearly instrumentalised  
- people detect cynicism  
- domestic anger outweighs emotional diversion  

Then, the external crisis becomes:

- a symbol of hypocrisy  
- a reminder of domestic neglect  
- a catalyst for protest  
- evidence of moral bankruptcy  

The absorption strategy breaks.

---

# 9. Why Crisis Absorption Is Intensifying (2023–2025)  
The modern landscape produces:

- constant global crises  
- instant visibility  
- fragmented information  
- eroded trust  
- collapsing middle-class buffers  
- authoritarian drift  
- historical survivor movements  
- widening inequality  

Governments under these pressures  
lean heavily on external atrocities to stabilise themselves.

You can see this pattern everywhere.

---

# 10. The Survivor Parallel  
Crisis absorption mirrors what survivors already know:

- abusers distract  
- institutions deflect  
- silence is bought with spectacle  
- complexity is buried under urgency  
- harm is displaced onto other narratives  

The macro mirrors the micro.

This is why so many survivors recognise political denial patterns instantly.  
They’ve lived the prototype.

*Crisis Absorption Logic* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how states under domestic strain absorb external atrocities to stabilise internal legitimacy, regulate attention, and delay accountability during political collapse.
