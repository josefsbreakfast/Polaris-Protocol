# 🧟‍♀️ Frankenstack: A Simple Explainer for Survivors  
**For anyone who has experienced “weird digital stuff,” confusing treatment from services, or situations that don’t make sense — this is what might actually be happening.**

## 🌱 What Is a Frankenstack? (Simple Version)

A **Frankenstack** is what happens when lots of different systems — apps, government databases, old safeguarding tools, behaviour-tracking software, bits of code, and risk flags — get stitched together by accident.

No one built it on purpose.  
No one is *technically* in charge of it.  
But once it exists, it behaves like its own creature.

And survivors often feel it first.

---

## 🧩 Why Does It Matter?

Because a Frankenstack can make your life feel **weird**, **wrong**, or **haunted**, even when you’re doing absolutely nothing unusual.

You might notice things like:

- “Why is my phone suggesting stuff that feels too close to home?”  
- “Why am I being shown content meant for the wrong demographic?”  
- “Why does this app think I’m in crisis when I’m not?”  
- “Why do government departments keep losing track of me?”  
- “Why does everyone give me different answers?”  
- “Why is everything so slow and contradictory?”  
- “Why is my data not matching who I am?”

These aren’t personal failures.  
They’re **systemic seams**.

---

## 🩹 Why Survivors Notice It First

Survivors often interact with:

- safeguarding systems  
- wellbeing tools  
- crisis flags  
- case-management notes  
- advice services  
- benefits or health structures  
- social apps that watch for risk patterns  

When these systems accidentally connect, the survivor becomes the **place where the wires cross**.

It’s not your fault.  
You’re simply standing where the data is most tangled.

## 🔍 What It Looks Like on Your Phone

Common signs:

- strange wellbeing prompts  
- algorithms pushing trauma or relationship content  
- apps suddenly “acting like they know things”  
- ads or recommendations meant for someone else  
- crisis nudges at random times  
- emotional tone misread by devices  
- repeated loops of the same type of content  
- your identity being mis-modelled (age, gender, risk, role)

This is not because anyone is “spying.”  
It’s because the Frankenstack is **badly stitched**.

## 🏛️ What It Looks Like in Government or Services

Survivors often experience:

- endless delays  
- being sent in circles  
- contradictory advice  
- multiple teams saying “we’re reviewing”  
- staff who look nervous or overly formal  
- decisions that never arrive  
- silence at crucial moments  
- high visibility but low support  
- being treated as the “uncertain variable”  

This isn’t about *you*.  
It’s about the system being confused by its own pipes.

---

## 🧠 Why Does the System Behave Like This?

Because the Frankenstack is built from:

- old databases  
- out-of-date risk flags  
- behavioural nudges  
- safeguarding logic  
- commercial algorithms  
- partial bits of policy  
- mismatched identity models  

None of these things talk cleanly to each other.  
But they leak into each other in unpredictable ways.

The result is behaviour that feels:

- inconsistent  
- uncanny  
- personal  
- intrusive  
- wrong  

But it comes from **misalignment**, not intention.

## 💛 The Most Important Part

**You are not imagining it.**  
You are not overreacting.  
You are not “reading into things.”  
There *are* seams showing.  
And those seams can feel frightening when you’re already under pressure.

A Frankenstack does not mean:
- someone is watching you  
- someone is targeting you  
- you are unsafe  

It means:
- the system is messy  
- old data is clashing with new data  
- services are scared of making mistakes  
- different teams are seeing different pieces  
- algorithms are guessing wrong  

You are reacting normally to an abnormal system.

---

## 🌷 What You Can Do

- Notice patterns, but don’t blame yourself.  
- Document inconsistencies calmly.  
- Ask staff to clarify which system they are looking at.  
- Remind yourself: **the mess is in the infrastructure, not in you.**  
- Seek human support (friends, therapists, advocates) when systems feel dehumanising.  
- Know that it gets better when the seams are cleaned up.
