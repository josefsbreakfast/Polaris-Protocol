# 🧟‍♀️ Frankenstack: Neurodivergent-Friendly Explainer  
**A clear, structured guide for when digital systems or services feel “off,” confusing, or inconsistent.**

## 🧠 What This Document Is For  
This guide is for you if you have thought:

- “My phone is acting weird and I don’t know why.”  
- “Different services keep giving me different answers.”  
- “People are treating me like I’m unpredictable when I’m not.”  
- “Nothing adds up and I can’t get a straight answer.”  

You are not imagining it.  
There is a systems reason.  
It is not about *you*.

## 🧰 What Is a Frankenstack? (Clear definition)

A **Frankenstack** = when lots of different systems accidentally get stitched together.

These systems might include:

- old safeguarding notes  
- behaviour-tracking software  
- wellbeing prompts  
- risk flags  
- demographic models  
- commercial algorithms  
- government databases  

They don’t talk to each other properly.  
But sometimes their data leaks into each other.

When this happens, the system behaves:

- unpredictably  
- inconsistently  
- in ways that feel too close  
- or as if it “knows something it shouldn’t”  

This is not because anyone is watching you.  
It is because the systems themselves are messy.

## 🧩 Why Neurodivergent People Notice First  
You might notice Frankenstack behaviour earlier because:

- you track patterns closely  
- you see inconsistencies faster  
- your sensory system picks up changes  
- you notice tone shifts in apps  
- you remember the “usual way” things behave  
- misclassification affects you more strongly  
- you rely on consistency to feel safe  

There is nothing wrong with your perception.  
Your perception is **accurate** — the systems are the ones misfiring.

## 📱 What It Looks Like on Your Phone  
You might see:

- recommendations that don’t match your interests  
- wellbeing or “are you okay?” prompts at random times  
- sudden bursts of trauma or relationship content  
- apps reacting to emotional tone you didn’t express  
- ads meant for the wrong demographic  
- loops of the same type of content  
- your device assuming you’re someone you’re not  

**Reason:**  
Different algorithms are pulling from mismatched bits of data and making wrong guesses.

This is a Frankenstack seam, not a personal flaw.

## 🏛️ What It Looks Like in Government or Support Services  
You might experience:

- slow replies  
- contradictory instructions  
- being sent to multiple teams  
- everything “on hold”  
- formality that feels cold  
- staff sounding nervous  
- unclear decisions  
- needing to repeat yourself  
- circular procedures  

**Reason:**  
Each team is looking at a different “slice” of the system.  
None of them see the whole picture.

It is the system that is inconsistent — not you.

---

## 📌 Key Reassurances (important)

- You are not in trouble.  
- You are not being monitored.  
- You are not imagining patterns.  
- Your mind is noticing real inconsistencies.  
- The system is confused, not you.  
- It is normal to feel unsettled by inconsistency.  
- Frankenstacks affect calm people, distressed people, *everyone*.  
- You are allowed to find it overwhelming or uncanny.  

Your reaction is valid.

## 🗺️ How to Understand What’s Happening (simple logic)

If the system feels **slow**, **cold**, or **paralysed** →  
**Freeze posture** (institution is scared to act)

If things feel **vague**, **drifty**, or **noncommittal** →  
**Fog posture** (institution is unsure what to do)

If things feel **defensive**, **legalistic**, or **closed** →  
**Fortress posture** (institution protecting itself)

If things feel **very fast** and **over-reactive** →  
**Flood posture** (panic response)

If you are **bounced around** with no owner →  
**Fragmentation posture** (system is split internally)

If everything is **warm**, **predictable**, **clear** →  
**Flow posture** (safe and coherent system)

You did nothing to cause these modes.  
They are environmental, not personal.

## ☀️ What Helps (especially for ND nervous systems)

- Write down contradictions instead of holding them in your head  
- Ask staff: “Which system are you looking at?”  
- Create a timeline to reduce overwhelm  
- Take breaks from apps when they feel uncanny  
- Tell trusted people when inconsistency is triggering  
- Keep interactions factual and brief when overwhelmed  
- Let yourself step back to regulate  
- Remember: inconsistency = system error  

Not you.

## 💛 A Very Important Reminder  
You are not “too sensitive.”  
You are not “overthinking.”  
You are not “paranoid.”  
Your nervous system is correctly detecting that the environment is behaving strangely.

A Frankenstack is confusing for **everyone** —  
neurodivergent people just notice the patterns earlier and more precisely.

That is a strength, not a flaw.
