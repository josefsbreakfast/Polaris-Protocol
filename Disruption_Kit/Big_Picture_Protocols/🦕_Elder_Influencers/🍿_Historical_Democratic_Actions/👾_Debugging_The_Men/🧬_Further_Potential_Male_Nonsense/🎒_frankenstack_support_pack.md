# 🎒 Frankenstack Support Pack  
**First created:** 2025-11-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-16  
*A complete, survivor-friendly toolkit for recognising system inconsistencies, grounding through overwhelm, and communicating safely with staff when the Frankenstack is active.*

---

# 🛰️ Orientation  
This pack is designed for anyone experiencing:

- weird behaviour on their phone  
- contradictory messages from services  
- circular escalation pathways  
- systems that feel “off,” uncanny, or inconsistent  
- procedural freeze, fog, or fragmentation  
- being treated differently depending on which system staff are reading  

You are not imagining it.  
This pack helps you understand what’s happening **and navigate it without losing yourself**.

# 1️⃣ 🧠 Quick Explainer: What a Frankenstack Is  
*A simple definition*

A **Frankenstack** is what happens when different government, safeguarding, technical, and commercial systems accidentally join together in the wrong way.

- They weren’t meant to connect.  
- No one is officially in charge of the seams.  
- They leak into each other in unpredictable ways.  

This can cause:

- weird digital behaviour  
- inconsistent risk signals  
- contradictory responses  
- system paralysis  
- misclassification  
- confused staff  
- delays that don’t make sense  

None of this is your fault.  
None of this means anyone is watching you.  
It means the infrastructure is behaving badly.

# 2️⃣ 🧟‍♀️ ND-Friendly Version (Pattern-Focused, Low-Ambiguity)

A Frankenstack shows up when:

- old data + new data collide  
- systems give conflicting information  
- apps misread your mood or identity  
- different teams see different versions of you  
- recommendation loops reflect the wrong story  

You notice it because:

- your brain tracks patterns accurately  
- you remember how things *normally* behave  
- inconsistency is hard on ND nervous systems  
- tone shifts and logic gaps stand out instantly  

You are right to notice.  
Your pattern-recognition is not the problem.  
The system’s patterns are the problem.

# 3️⃣ 🪴 Grounding Script for Frankenstack Overwhelm

Take a breath.

You are here.  
You are real.  
The system is glitching.  
**You are not.**

Say:

- “Systems glitch. I do not.”  
- “This is confusion, not danger.”  
- “My reactions make sense.”  
- “This is a system error, not a me error.”  

Feel your feet.  
Feel the floor.  
Pause.

Nothing is required of you right now.  
You can step back.  
You can log off.  
You can come back later.

You are not alone.  
You are not imagining it.  
You are safe enough to pause.

# 4️⃣ 🗣️ How to Talk to Staff When Systems Don’t Talk  
*Scripts that reduce misinterpretation and avoid triggering freeze.*

### ✔️ Name the mismatch
- “Different parts of the system are giving me different information.”  
- “I think the systems aren’t talking to each other.”  

### ✔️ Ask what dataset they’re viewing  
- “Can I check which system you’re seeing my case in?”  
- “Is this the safeguarding record, HR record, or another one?”  

### ✔️ Ask for ownership, not urgency  
- “Who currently owns the next step?”  
- “Who should I follow up with?”  

### ✔️ Ask for clarity, not action  
- “I’m not asking for everything at once — just clarity on what’s happening.”  

### ✔️ Validate the worker as human  
- “I know this must be difficult with multiple systems.”  
- “Thanks for helping me navigate this.”  

This shifts staff out of Fortress Mode into Soft Clerk Mode.

# 5️⃣ 🧾 Pocket Cards (quick-reference phrases)

### 🔹 When the system is confusing  
**“This looks like a system inconsistency — can you help me interpret it?”**

### 🔹 When you get contradictory updates  
**“Can we map where the contradiction is coming from?”**

### 🔹 When staff seem nervous  
**“No pressure — clarity is all I need today.”**

### 🔹 When you fear being misread  
**“I’m presenting information, not emotion.”**

### 🔹 When you’re overwhelmed  
**“I need to pause and return when regulated.”**

### 🔹 When you need stability  
**“Who should I follow up with, and when?”**

# 6️⃣ 🧭 Escalation Map (Simple Logic)

### If everything is sloooow + formal → **Freeze Mode**  
→ Ask for clarity. Don’t push for action.

### If everything is vague → **Fog Mode**  
→ Ask who owns the case.

### If everything is defensive → **Fortress Mode**  
→ Keep conversations factual, brief.

### If everything suddenly explodes → **Flood Mode**  
→ Step back. Let the spike pass.

### If you’re bounced around → **Fragmentation Mode**  
→ Ask: “Who is the single point of contact?”

### If things are clear and warm → **Flow Mode**  
→ Proceed with normal engagement.

# 7️⃣ 🔍 Signs It’s a System Issue (Not You)

- safeguarding or wellness prompts appear at the wrong time  
- the process resets without explanation  
- delays make no structural sense  
- escalation loops round in circles  
- the tone shifts depending on which department responds  

If 3+ are true → **you’re not the problem — the Frankenstack is.**
