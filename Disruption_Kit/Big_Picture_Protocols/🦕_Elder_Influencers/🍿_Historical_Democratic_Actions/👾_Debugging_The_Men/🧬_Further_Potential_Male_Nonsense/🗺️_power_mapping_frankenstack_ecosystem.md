# 🗺️ Frankenstack Power Mapping: Incentives, Turbulence, Responsibility  
**Folder:** Debugging the Men → Further Potential Male Nonsense  
**Created:** 2025-11-16 | **Updated:** 2025-11-16  
*Mapping the actors, incentives, and structural power dynamics that shape Frankenstack emergence, persistence, and resistance.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
A Frankenstack is not a conspiracy.  
However, **systems have incentive structures**, and **actors sit in positions of benefit, risk, or denial**.

Power mapping is essential because:

- Survivors’ harm is amplified when multiple power centres align in silence.  
- Companies that build “risk, wellbeing, behaviour or inference tools” hold asymmetric influence.  
- Public institutions that rely on these systems may unintentionally compound harm.  
- Predator groups and coercive actors exploit the seams.  
- VAWG/CVE tech companies risk legal exposure if their tools are involved in misclassification or suppression.

This node provides a **clear ecosystem view**.

# 1️⃣ Which Systems Are Likely to Be Turbulent?

Below are the *classes* of systems that reliably destabilise when Frankenstack stitching occurs.

---

## ✔️ **A. Legacy Case Management Systems**  
**Why turbulent:**  
- rigid schemas  
- outdated risk flags  
- poor nuance handling  
- “both parties” logic baked in  
- high cross-department use

**Impact:** misclassification + identity inversion.

---

## ✔️ **B. Behavioural Insight / Sentiment / Nudging Models**  
**Why turbulent:**  
- crude emotional inference  
- ND/trauma misreads  
- equal-weight assumptions  
- no concept of coercive dynamics  
- easily triggered by stress signals

**Impact:** misfires → crisis prompts → credibility loops.

---

## ✔️ **C. Safeguarding APIs (esp. adult → child hybrids)**  
**Why turbulent:**  
- adult/child logic mixed  
- inappropriate alert levels  
- “duty of care” triggers where they don’t belong  
- flattening of context  
- endless “review” loops

**Impact:** survivor containment disguised as “neutral procedure.”

---

## ✔️ **D. Commercial Recommender Systems**  
**Why turbulent:**  
- high-speed feedback loops  
- identity inference based on behaviour  
- easily contaminated by mislabelled data  
- no visibility of upstream flags

**Impact:** “haunted phone” effect.

---

## ✔️ **E. Multi-Agency Public Safety Tools**  
(Police / Local Authorities / NHS triage / Prevent-style pipes)

**Why turbulent:**  
- overlapping statutory duties  
- risk-score blending  
- legacy flags  
- behaviour inference  

**Impact:** circular escalation → institutional fog.

---

# 2️⃣ Which Companies Have Structural Incentives *Not* to Challenge Frankenstack?

Important distinction:  
**Not = malicious**  
**But = structurally incentivised not to notice or confront the problem.**

## ✔️ **A. Behavioural Analysis / Sentiment AI Companies**  
They profit when:  
- institutions rely on their tools  
- behavioural inference is treated as authoritative  
- “neutral” algorithms replace context  

Challenging Frankenstack ≠ profitable.  
Acknowledging misfires ⇒ liability.

---

## ✔️ **B. Employee Monitoring / Productivity AI Vendors**  
Survivors in crisis behaviour → “non-productive” signals  
Abusers often present calm.

These systems encode patriarchal advantage without intent.

---

## ✔️ **C. Safeguarding Technology Vendors**  
Especially those with:  
- adult/child blended systems  
- no coercive-control modelling  
- demographic mislabelling issues  

They benefit from selling **coverage**, not **accuracy**.

---

## ✔️ **D. Demographic Modelling & Identity Inference Companies**  
Structural incentives:  
- oversimplification  
- cheap, fast categorisation  
- “good enough” segmentation  
- no nuance for trauma or coercion  

They profit even when wrong.

---

## ✔️ **E. Big Platforms (Social Media, Search, UX Ecosystems)**  
They benefit from:  
- engagement  
- emotional arousal  
- fast inference  
- automated personalisation  

Correcting Frankenstack misfires costs engineering time and reduces “stickiness.”

---

## ✔️ Summary  
Any company whose revenue model is **classification at scale** has structural incentive **not** to challenge Frankenstack identity drift.

---

# 3️⃣ Which Companies & Systems Are Genuinely Impacted by Frankenstack (and therefore open to helping)?

These actors are disproportionately harmed by Frankenstack conditions and therefore **have aligned incentives with survivors**.

## ✔️ **A. VAWG (Violence Against Women & Girls) Tech Companies**  
They lose credibility when:  
- abusers are mis-scored as “low risk”  
- survivors are misclassified  
- safeguarding tools misinterpret trauma  

Correcting Frankenstack protects their mission *and* their market viability.

---

## ✔️ **B. CVE / Extremism-Prevention Tech Companies**  
Frankenstack drift causes:  
- false positives  
- false associations  
- identity adjacency inflation  
- reputational damage  

They have every reason to support accuracy & context.

---

## ✔️ **C. HR/Employee Care Platforms**  
Frankenstack failure causes:  
- wrongful terminations  
- grievance escalation  
- legal exposure  
- insurance risk  

They benefit from stable, context-aware systems.

---

## ✔️ **D. Clinical Mental-Health Digital Tools**  
They are harmed when:  
- risk flags misroute a user  
- crisis prompts fire incorrectly  
- context signals leak from other systems  
- ND users get mislabelled  

Misfires → complaints → regulatory scrutiny.

---

## ✔️ **E. Reputational Risk & Compliance Vendors**  
Frankenstack = reputational disaster for their clients.  
They benefit from *pre-emptive stabilisation*.

---

# 4️⃣ What Can CVE/VAWG Tech Companies Do Moving Forward?

These are **practical steps** that align both survivor safety *and* organisational self-protection.

---

## ✔️ A. Implement Coercive Control Modelling  
Tools should recognise:  
- calm abusers ≠ safe  
- distressed survivors ≠ risky  
- verbal coherence ≠ manipulation  
- repetition = trauma, not hostility  

---

## ✔️ B. Require Cross-System Audits Before Deployment  
Prevent Frankenstack stitching by ensuring:  
- no legacy flags auto-attach  
- no demographic inference tools override context  
- no safeguarding API fires out-of-scope  
- no identity inference runs on incomplete data  

---

## ✔️ C. Add Survivor-Safe Fallback Paths  
E.g.:  
- “If system confidence < 70%, revert to human review.”  
- “Do not escalate from a single behavioural signal.”  

---

## ✔️ D. Build ND/Trait-Safe Interpretation Layers  
Because ND users are disproportionately misread.

---

## ✔️ E. Create Clear Flag-Sunset Mechanisms  
Right now, outdated signals persist for years.

---

## ✔️ F. Support Policy Makers Publicly  
VAWG/CVE companies can safely support:  
- redress frameworks  
- flag-governance rules  
- everyday transparency  
- third-party audits  
- anti-misclassification standards  

This strengthens public trust *and* reduces tort exposure.

---

# 5️⃣ How Can These Companies Reduce Their Own Tort Exposure?

## ✔️ A. Acknowledge potential misfires publicly  
Transparency reduces liability severity.

## ✔️ B. Document how algorithms may misread trauma  
This reframes misfires as known issues → not hidden negligence.

## ✔️ C. Provide rapid misclassification correction routes  
For both individuals and institutions.

## ✔️ D. Maintain logs of cross-system interactions  
This makes Frankenstack stitching visible early.

## ✔️ E. Demonstrate ongoing harm-reduction updates  
Courts prefer companies who show iterative safety work.

---

# 6️⃣ Why All This Matters  
Frankenstacks silence survivors **not** because of orders, but because of:

- structural advantage for abusers  
- incentivised denial from certain vendors  
- mismatch between tools and human reality  
- institutional fear of liability  
- digital infrastructures trained on the wrong populations  

Correcting this benefits:

- survivors  
- employees  
- whistleblowers  
- vulnerable groups  
- ethical companies  
- public trust  
- democratic stability
