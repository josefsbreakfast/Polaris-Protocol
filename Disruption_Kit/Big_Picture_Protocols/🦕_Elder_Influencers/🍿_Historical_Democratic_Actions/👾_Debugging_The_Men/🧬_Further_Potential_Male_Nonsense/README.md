## 🛰️ Orientation  
This cluster deals with **systemic male-pattern behaviour** as it emerges in governance, institutions, data systems, and digital infrastructures — not as individual pathology, but as **repeatable algorithmic failure modes**.

It includes analysis of:

- coercive actor exploitation pathways  
- Frankenstack emergence and failure conditions  
- token switching & identity inversion  
- institutional freeze/fog/fortress behaviour  
- credibility loops, witch logic, and ND misread patterns  
- data twinning & metadata adjacency  
- predator-group dynamics in misaligned systems  
- emergent harm patterns that disproportionately impact women & survivors

This folder provides **diagnostics**, **explainers**, **survivor tools**, and **governance-level recommendations** for identifying and neutralising these harm patterns.

Tone: part anthropological, part technical, part “for the love of god, can we please stop this nonsense.”

## ⚖️ Licensing & Ethics  
Polaris operates under a dual-licensing ethos:

### **🟦 Creative Commons — for survivors, advocates, public-interest use**  
Any material intended to help survivors, vulnerable users, or harmed communities is freely shareable, printable, adaptable, and distributable with attribution.

### **🟥 Strict IP Protection — for extractive, exploitative, or harmful use**  
Any entity attempting to use Polaris material to:
- develop behavioural-inference tech  
- create profiling tools  
- expand surveillance infrastructures  
- manipulate or contain survivors  
- monetise lived experience  
- or replicate these systems commercially  

will trigger **full IP enforcement**, including tort, breach, and misuse-of-research protections.

Polaris exists to protect people, not to fuel extractive architectures.

## 🏮 Footer  
This folder is part of the Disruption Kit’s Elder Influencer ecosystem —  
a set of tools for tracing historic, behavioural, and infrastructural patterns of democratic failure and quietly fixing them from the inside.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
