# 🫀 A Question of Questions  
### Prolonged Starvation, Parliamentary Process, and Democratic Accountability

---

## Executive summary

This document examines a governance failure arising during a prolonged hunger strike involving individuals held on remand. It does not assess guilt or innocence, nor does it argue the merits of any prosecution. Instead, it addresses a narrower and more fundamental issue:

> **How democratic institutions respond to time-dependent, escalating physiological harm in custody, and whether parliamentary processes are functioning fairly, proportionately, and accountably under those conditions.**

Hunger strikes are not static political events. They are **predictable, medically progressive emergencies** in which each day of delay compounds risk non-linearly. Once prolonged starvation is established, harm is no longer fully reversible; even refeeding carries a significant risk of mortality.

During this period, Parliament sat repeatedly without a corresponding pattern of routine oral scrutiny. This absence raises serious questions about process, deterrence, securitisation of scrutiny, and the credibility of democratic accountability mechanisms — particularly where the underlying actions relate to attempts by the public to hold government accountable under international law.

## 1. Starvation physiology: a time-dependent emergency

After approximately **4–6 weeks of inadequate caloric intake**, the human body transitions from adaptive fasting to **pathological starvation**. At this stage, multiple organ systems are structurally and metabolically compromised.

### 1.1 Metabolic and endocrine changes
- Chronic **insulin suppression** with glucagon and cortisol dominance  
- **Low T3 syndrome** (adaptive hypothyroidism)  
- Suppression of gonadotropins and disruption of the HPA axis  
- Reduced basal metabolic rate, insufficient to prevent organ catabolism  

### 1.2 Electrolyte and micronutrient depletion (total body)
Serum values may appear deceptively normal while **total body stores are profoundly depleted**.

Key ions affected:
- **Phosphate (PO₄³⁻)** – depleted due to ATP consumption and lack of intake  
- **Potassium (K⁺)** – intracellular depletion despite normal serum levels  
- **Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** – depletion increasing arrhythmia risk  
- **Calcium (Ca²⁺)** – dysregulation secondary to phosphate shifts  
- **Thiamine (vitamin B₁)** – depletion risking acute neurological injury  

### 1.3 Organ system consequences
- **Cardiac**: myocardial atrophy, reduced stroke volume, QT prolongation, arrhythmogenic myocardium  
- **Neurological**: peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, Wernicke–Korsakoff risk  
- **Hepatic**: impaired gluconeogenesis, altered drug metabolism, hypoalbuminaemia  
- **Respiratory**: diaphragmatic muscle wasting  
- **Immune**: lymphocyte suppression, blunted inflammatory response  
- **Musculoskeletal**: skeletal muscle catabolism, frailty, risk of sudden collapse  

At this stage, the body is no longer “waiting to be fed”. It is **structurally compromised**.

---

## 2. Refeeding syndrome: predictable and lethal

Refeeding syndrome is a **well-characterised and mechanistically inevitable risk** following prolonged starvation.

### 2.1 Mechanism
- Reintroduction of carbohydrates → **insulin surge**  
- Rapid cellular uptake of **phosphate**, **potassium**, and **magnesium**  
- Resulting **hypophosphataemia** → ATP depletion  

### 2.2 Clinical consequences
- Acute cardiac failure and malignant arrhythmias  
- Respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic weakness  
- Rhabdomyolysis  
- Seizures  
- Sudden death, often within days of refeeding  

**Key implication:**  
> Allowing starvation to progress increases mortality risk **even if feeding later resumes**.

Delay is therefore not neutral. It is **risk accumulation**.

## 3. Remand and duty of care

Individuals held on **remand**:
- have not been convicted,  
- are presumed innocent,  
- and may only be detained on grounds of risk.  

Where:
- health deterioration is foreseeable,  
- harm is time-dependent and escalating,  
- and non-custodial alternatives exist,  

continued detention engages:
- **Article 2 ECHR** (right to life),  
- **Article 3 ECHR** (inhuman or degrading treatment),  
- the state’s **positive duty of care**.  

Parliamentary scrutiny of these issues does **not** interfere with court proceedings.

---

## 4. Parliamentary process and absence of scrutiny

During the hunger strike:
- Parliament sat on multiple occasions.  
- A single Early Day Motion was tabled.  
- No routine pattern of oral questions addressing escalating medical risk emerged.  

In comparable time-critical contexts, Parliament typically:
- rotates MPs asking similar questions,  
- repeats scrutiny across sittings,  
- escalates attention as harm worsens.  

The absence of this pattern suggests one of three possibilities:
1. MPs did not submit questions.  
2. Questions were submitted but procedurally blocked.  
3. Informal deterrence suppressed scrutiny.  

Each scenario represents a governance failure.

---

## 5. Accountability inversion and international law

The actions leading to detention arose from **attempts to hold the UK Government accountable under international law**, including the Genocide Convention and international humanitarian law.

Despite public pressure and partial measures such as selective arms licence suspensions, meaningful accountability has not materialised. Instead:
- individuals pursuing accountability have been criminalised,  
- subjected to prolonged remand,  
- exposed to reputational and career-ending harm,  
- allowed to deteriorate physiologically in custody.  

This represents an inversion of responsibility.

---

## 6. Weaponisation of democratic values

Under UK counterterrorism policy, “British values” include:
- democracy,  
- rule of law,  
- individual liberty,  
- accountability of government.  

Lawful dissent is framed as a **protective factor against radicalisation**.

In this case, those values have been operationally inverted, producing the perception that:
> democratic action is tolerated only when it is inconsequential.

---

## 7. Psychological and security implications

The hunger strike is:
- publicly visible,  
- algorithmically amplified,  
- disproportionately viewed by populations already exposed to severe distress.  

The combination of bodily deterioration in UK custody, mass civilian suffering abroad, and institutional silence produces:
- vicarious trauma,  
- alienation,  
- erosion of trust,  
- increased destabilisation risk.  

From a security perspective, **procedural indifference is a liability**.

---

## 8. National security and scrutiny

If scrutiny has been limited due to national security considerations, justification must be:
- explicit,  
- legally grounded,  
- proportionate,  
- accountable.  

Securitising parliamentary questions about health and detention undermines legitimacy.

---

## 9. The core governance question

> **How does the system respond when harm is escalating daily, predictably, and irreversibly — and silence itself becomes a decision?**

A system unable to tolerate routine scrutiny under these conditions is not resilient.

---

## 10. Minimum requirements for accountability

Governance integrity requires:
- traceability of whether questions were asked or blocked,  
- transparency around exceptional justifications,  
- proportional response to physiological reality.  

Silence without explanation is not neutrality.  
In time-dependent injury, it is **policy by omission**.
