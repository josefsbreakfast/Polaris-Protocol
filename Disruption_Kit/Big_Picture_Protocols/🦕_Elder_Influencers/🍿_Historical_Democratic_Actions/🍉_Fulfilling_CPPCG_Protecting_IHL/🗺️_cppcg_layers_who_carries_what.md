# 🗺️ CPPCG Layers: Who Carries What

**Folder:** Disruption_Kit / Big_Picture_Protocols / 🦕_Elder_Influencers / 🍿_Historical_Democratic_Actions / 🍉_Fulfilling_CPPCG_Protecting_IHL  
**Status:** Skeleton  
**Scope:** Legal–ethical mapping across actors  
**Function:** Clarificatory + accountability-routing

---

## Orientation

- Why genocide prevention fails when responsibility is treated as singular  
- How the CPPCG distributes duties across actors, not just states  
- Why confusion over “who should act” enables inaction

---

## The core premise

The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) does not assign responsibility to a single actor.

It creates **layered, overlapping duties** that operate simultaneously.

Failure occurs when:
- each layer waits for another, or
- one layer suppresses the actions of another.

---

## Layer 1: Individuals

### What individuals can reasonably carry
- Raising alarm
- Bearing witness
- Documenting harm
- Refusing complicity
- Peaceful protest and disruption

### Common failure mode
- Criminalising prevention activity
- Treating moral urgency as instability
- Expecting silence until certainty

**Risk:** Penalising compliance with Article I.

---

## Layer 2: Institutions

### Who this includes
- Universities
- Media organisations
- Police forces
- Corporations
- Professional bodies
- Courts and regulators

### What institutions carry
- Risk assessment without overreach
- Protection of lawful speech
- Transparency in decision-making
- Avoidance of facilitation or laundering of harm

### Common failure mode
- Procedural deferral (“not our remit”)
- Over-classification of risk
- Collapsing dissent into disorder

**Risk:** Structural obstruction of prevention.

---

## Layer 3: State actors

### Who this includes
- Government departments
- Legislatures
- Executives
- Military and security apparatus
- Diplomatic corps

### What states carry
- Duty to prevent (Article I)
- Duty not to aid or abet genocide
- Duty to align domestic law with international obligations
- Duty to protect those acting in prevention

### Common failure mode
- Prioritising narrative stability over legal duty
- Using counterterrorism to manage reputational risk
- Treating prevention as foreign policy disruption

**Risk:** Breach by omission or misapplication.

---

## Layer interaction failures

Prevention collapses when:

- Individuals are silenced by institutions  
- Institutions defer upward to the state  
- States externalise responsibility internationally  
- Each layer claims it acted “within its role”

This produces **total failure without individual intent**.

---

## Anti-Palestinian misrecognition across layers

- Individuals’ speech framed as suspect
- Institutions interpret Palestinian solidarity as inherent risk
- States prioritise alliance maintenance over civilian protection

The harm compounds across layers.

---

## Rebound effects on Jewish dissent

- Jewish individuals punished for breaking expected narratives
- Institutions pathologise dissent as emotional or destabilising
- States benefit from presenting Jewish opinion as monolithic

This is a layered antisemitic failure.

---

## Diagnostic questions

Ask at each layer:

- What is my actual duty under Article I?
- Am I blocking another layer from acting?
- Am I mistaking risk management for prevention?
- Who benefits from delay?

---

## What this node is not

- Not a legal brief
- Not an assignment of guilt
- Not a hierarchy of moral worth

---

## Why this node exists

- To redistribute responsibility correctly
- To prevent paralysis through misrouting
- To make prevention actionable at every level

*Stardust:*  
Genocide prevention fails not because no one is responsible,  
but because everyone assumes someone else is.
