# 🗺️ CPPCG Layers: Who Carries What  
**First created:** 2026-01-02 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Why genocide prevention fails when responsibility is misrouted.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node clarifies how responsibility under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) is **distributed, layered, and concurrent**.

It exists because genocide prevention repeatedly fails when:
- responsibility is treated as singular,
- action is deferred “upward,” or
- one layer suppresses another under the guise of order, neutrality, or competence.

The CPPCG does not imagine a single heroic actor.  
It imagines **systems that work together — or fail together**.

---

## ⚖️ The core premise  

The CPPCG creates **overlapping duties** across different actors.

These duties:
- operate simultaneously,
- are context-dependent,
- and cannot be discharged by delegation alone.

Failure most often occurs not through explicit refusal, but through:
- misinterpretation of scope,
- over-deference to authority,
- or obstruction disguised as procedural caution.

---

## 🧍 Layer 1: Individuals  

### What individuals can reasonably carry  

Under Article I, individuals may act in prevention through:

- raising alarm,
- bearing witness,
- documenting harm,
- refusing complicity,
- peaceful protest and disruption,
- journalism, research, and public communication.

These actions are **not optional moral extras**.  
They are often the *first line* of prevention.

### Common failure mode  

- Criminalising or chilling prevention activity  
- Treating moral urgency as instability  
- Expecting silence until certainty  
- Demanding neutrality in the face of atrocity  

**Risk:** Penalising compliance with Article I.

When individuals are punished for acting early, the system teaches that prevention is unsafe.

---

## 🏛️ Layer 2: Institutions  

### Who this includes  

- Universities and schools  
- Media organisations and publishers  
- Police forces and oversight bodies  
- Corporations and financial institutions  
- Professional associations  
- Courts, regulators, and quasi-judicial bodies  

Institutions are the **transmission layer** between individuals and the state.

### What institutions carry  

Institutions are responsible for:

- receiving dissent and alarm without reflexive suppression,  
- conducting risk assessment without category drift,  
- protecting lawful speech and inquiry,  
- maintaining transparency in justification and process,  
- avoiding material, reputational, or procedural facilitation of harm.

They are not neutral bystanders.  
Their procedures shape outcomes.

### Common failure mode  

- Procedural deferral (“not our remit”)  
- Over-classification of risk  
- Treating dissent as disorder  
- Prioritising institutional comfort over legal duty  

**Risk:** Structural obstruction of prevention.

Institutions often fail by **mistaking risk management for prevention**.

---

## 🏴 Layer 3: State actors  

### Who this includes  

- Government departments  
- Legislatures and executives  
- Military and security services  
- Diplomatic and trade apparatus  
- Senior civil service leadership  

States are the **only layer** with full legal capacity — but not the only one with responsibility.

### What states carry  

Under the CPPCG, states carry:

- the positive duty to prevent (Article I),  
- the duty not to aid or abet genocide,  
- the duty to align domestic law with international obligations,  
- the duty to protect those acting in prevention,  
- the duty to correct misapplication across institutions.

### Common failure mode  

- Prioritising narrative stability over legal obligation  
- Externalising prevention to international bodies  
- Using counter-terrorism or public order law to manage reputational risk  
- Treating prevention as foreign-policy disruption  

**Risk:** Breach by omission or misapplication.

States most often fail by **acting too late, too indirectly, or too defensively**.

---

## 🔄 Layer interaction failures  

Genocide prevention collapses when:

- individuals are silenced by institutions,  
- institutions defer upward to the state,  
- states externalise responsibility internationally,  
- each layer claims it acted “within its role.”

This produces **total failure without individual malice**.

No one actor needs to intend harm.  
The system fails by design.

---

## 🍉 Anti-Palestinian misrecognition across layers  

Across the layers, a consistent distortion appears:

- Individual Palestinian or solidarity speech is framed as suspect  
- Institutions interpret Palestinian advocacy as inherent risk  
- States prioritise alliance maintenance over civilian protection  

Each layer amplifies the next.

What begins as misrecognition becomes **structural exclusion**.

---

## ✡️ Rebound effects on Jewish dissent  

This failure does not only harm Palestinians.

It also produces layered antisemitic effects:

- Jewish individuals are punished for breaking expected narratives  
- Institutions pathologise Jewish dissent as emotional or destabilising  
- States benefit from presenting Jewish opinion as monolithic  

Jewish plurality is sacrificed for political convenience.

This is not protection.  
It is instrumentalisation.

---

## 🧪 Diagnostic questions  

At **each layer**, ask:

- What is my actual duty under Article I?  
- Am I enabling another layer — or blocking it?  
- Am I mistaking stability for safety?  
- Am I treating dissent as information or as threat?  
- Who benefits from delay?

If the answer is “someone else will handle it,” failure is already underway.

---

## 🚫 What this node is not  

This node is not:

- a legal indictment,  
- a hierarchy of moral worth,  
- a claim that all actors have equal power,  
- or a demand for uniform tactics.

It is a **routing map** — not a verdict.

---

## 🧭 Why this node exists  

This node exists to:

- redistribute responsibility accurately,  
- prevent paralysis through misrouting,  
- make prevention actionable at every level,  
- and clarify that *inaction is also a choice*.

*CPPCG Layers: Who Carries What* is a clarificatory node within the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to make prevention concrete, distributed, and actionable — and to show how genocide prevention fails not because responsibility is absent, but because it is continually misassigned.

*Prevention is not a baton to be passed upward.*  
*It is a system that must function at every layer.*
