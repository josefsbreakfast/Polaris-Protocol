## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines what happens when policing is asked to manage a situation that is simultaneously:

- politically unprecedented,  
- legally unsettled, and  
- emotionally charged at a civilisational level.  

From late 2023 onward, UK policing has been required to respond to mass protest framed as genocide prevention while operating amid:

- evolving international legal findings (ICJ, ICC),  
- heightened terrorism narratives,  
- inconsistent institutional signals, and  
- a widening gap between public rhetoric and legal reality.  

What follows is not an accusation of individual malice.  
It is an analysis of **how uncertainty propagates through systems**, and how that uncertainty can quietly solidify into overreach.

---

## ⚖️ The core problem: uncertainty defaults to severity  

When frontline officers and commanders face unclear boundaries, several predictable dynamics emerge:

- **Ambiguity is interpreted conservatively**  
  Where the line is unclear, the safest professional option is to assume risk.

- **Precedent outweighs context**  
  Earlier escalations become templates, even when circumstances differ materially.

- **Responsibility migrates upward**  
  Decisions are deferred to “national security,” “counterterrorism,” or “someone above my pay grade.”

- **Proportionality erodes quietly**  
  The operative question shifts from *“Is this necessary?”* to *“What if we miss something?”*

None of this requires bad intent.  
It is how complex organisations behave under pressure.

## 🧱 Why Palestine-related policing became especially distorted  

Several factors converged to make Palestine solidarity activity unusually vulnerable to misclassification:

- **Policy bleed between antisemitism guidance and public-order policing**  
  Inconsistent understanding of IHRA / JDA distinctions filtered unevenly into practice.

- **Counter-terrorism frameworks standing adjacent to protest policing**  
  Even when not formally invoked, their presence shapes tone, thresholds, and escalation logic.

- **Narrative instability at the state level**  
  As the “Israel acting in self-defence” frame weakened internationally, domestic uncertainty increased.

- **Early high-profile arrests creating informal precedent**  
  Once some cases were escalated, later ones were treated as comparable by default.

The result is a situation where **policing behaviour appeared to change faster than the law itself**.

---

## 🧮 Risk assessment as a moving target  

Risk assessment is not static.  
It is shaped by what police believe other parts of the state are doing.

Where universities, government departments, or allied institutions appear to treat certain sites or protests as **security-relevant**, policing adapts accordingly.

This produces cascading effects:

- individuals become “known” within systems as risks,  
- future encounters are framed through inherited classification,  
- de-escalation becomes less likely, not more,  
- terrorism powers feel closer even when legally unjustified.  

Over time, **risk is no longer assessed afresh**.  
It is inherited.

---

## 🧾 Transparency gaps and institutional drift  

A recurring feature since 2024 has been a mismatch between:

- **formal statements** (FOI responses, public assurances), and  
- **observable practice** (security posture, arrest patterns, escalation levels).  

These statements do not originate from policing alone.  
They arise across the **entire institutional layer** — universities, regulators, government-aligned bodies, and departments.

Where explanation is absent, vague, or implausible:

- policing absorbs political risk,  
- officers become the visible face of decisions they did not set, and  
- legitimacy erodes through confusion rather than confrontation.  

This is compounded by a wider problem:  
**a wartime rhetorical posture operating within peacetime law**.

Without clear, centralised guidance reconciling rhetoric, policy, and statute, uncertainty becomes systemic.

Policing cannot carry this alone.  
Leadership is required to re-anchor the system.

---

## 🎓 MOD-adjacent precedent and risk propagation  

Where university campuses are informally treated as defence-adjacent or asset-sensitive space, a precedent is set.

That precedent propagates through policing systems:

- deployment assumptions (“how many officers last time”),  
- risk flags and annotations,  
- and future response thresholds.  

Once a person or site has been associated with “national security relevance,” that classification can persist — even where underlying activity is lawful, non-violent, and protest-based.

This is not a conspiracy.  
It is **how precautionary systems function**.

The difficulty is that what began as site-based caution can become **person-based inheritance**, including for journalists engaging sources who may themselves be flagged.

---

## ⚖️ Equality impact and baseline securitisation  

In this context, it must be stated clearly:

By definition, Palestinian identity — or being racialised as Palestinian — is securitised at a higher baseline unless one explicitly endorses state violence against Gaza.

This produces foreseeable equality impacts:

- heightened scrutiny of Palestinian students and staff,  
- spillover onto Muslim, Arab, and brown communities more broadly,  
- and disproportionate exposure to policing escalation.

Where protest securitisation disproportionately affects a specific ethnic group, **equality impact assessment is not optional**.

Failure to anticipate and mitigate this impact constitutes a governance failure, even absent discriminatory intent.  

When this co-occurs during active military-perpetuated assaults onto Palestinian civilians across Palestine, including Gaza, British Palestinians and Palestinian diaspora in the UK are being expected to manage:  
- the anticipation of potential death or injury to family and friends in Palestine;
- being flattened to a political talking point by geopolitical news;
- having one's own identity being treated as risk and marker in environments using "diversity" as the rationale;
- being the target group of a credible genocide, perpetrated by an ally of the UK;  
- having own's own mourning, and appropriate anger at suffering, be treated as "inappropriate", made illegal, and securitised.

Asking someone to manage this emotional and cognitive complexity, and expecting them to always be the height of civility and politeness, is inhumane.  

Expecting this of people at risk of genocide, strongly suggests that that risk is not taken with the seriousness it deserves.

## 🪬 Rebound effects on Jewish dissent  

This dynamic does not protect Jewish communities.  
It destabilises them.

As Palestinian expression is increasingly policed:

- Jewish students and staff are implicitly locked into a foreign state narrative,  
- dissenting Jewish voices become more isolated and more visible,  
- crossing even mild lines (“genocide is bad”) becomes higher risk, and  
- alt-right actors gain cover to target Jewish dissenters under the guise of “community conflict.”

This multiplies risk:

- doxxing and harassment increase,  
- antisemitic violence is easier to obscure,  
- and genuine community safety is degraded rather than enhanced.

Securitisation here **creates the harm it claims to prevent**.  

Given the specific histry which tools like the IHRA seek to protect, the foregoing of this standard in order to secure specofiv military narratives can be deeply concerning for the diasporic "middle ground", without producing loud outputs.  

---

## 💔 Police wellbeing and moral injury  

This period has also imposed significant ethical strain on policing.

Officers have been asked to:

- police grief, trauma, and genocide discourse,  
- operate under unclear or shifting guidance,  
- absorb political risk they did not create, and  
- enforce decisions that diverge from everyday norms of public-order policing.

This produces **moral injury** — the psychological harm that arises when individuals are required to act against their ethical understanding of their role.

Common outcomes include:

- procedural rigidity as self-protection,  
- reduced tolerance for ambiguity,  
- faster escalation to avoid professional risk.

These are survival adaptations — but they increase the likelihood of overreach.

## 📦 Arrest pattern snapshot (contextual, non-exhaustive)

> **Purpose:**  
> This table illustrates pattern and clustering, not guilt or innocence.  
> It shows how escalation logic propagated across journalism, protest, and student activity.

## 🧄 Risk untagging and reset (what correction looks like)  

Correction does not require humiliation or admissions of bad faith.

It requires **procedural reset**:

- review and removal of inherited risk tags where no evidence exists,  
- explicit separation between protest, journalism, and terrorism frameworks,  
- guidance updates reflecting international legal developments,  
- permission to de-escalate without career penalty.

Risk, once applied, must be capable of being **unwound**.

---

## 🌀 Why this feels chaotic from the inside  

From within institutions, this period feels fragmented rather than coordinated:

- no single authority clearly “owns” the problem,  
- guidance arrives late or indirectly,  
- reputational risk flows downward,  
- escalation feels safer than restraint.

This is not conspiracy.  
It is **system stress without leadership**.

## 🗺️ CPPCG implications  

Article I of the CPPCG establishes a positive duty to prevent genocide.

Where lawful prevention activity is chilled, criminalised, or misclassified under terrorism frameworks, the failure is not only civil-liberties harm.

It is **structural prevention failure**.

*Policing an Unknown* is a diagnostic node within the **Polaris Protocol**.

It explains how ambiguity, precedent pressure, and misaligned leadership can drive escalation without requiring bad faith — and why clarity, not severity, is the primary safety mechanism.

*Uncertainty unmanaged becomes authority.*  
*Clarity is a form of care.*
