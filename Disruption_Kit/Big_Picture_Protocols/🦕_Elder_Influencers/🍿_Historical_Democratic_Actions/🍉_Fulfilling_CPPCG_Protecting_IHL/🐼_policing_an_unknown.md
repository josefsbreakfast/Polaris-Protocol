# 🐼 Policing an Unknown

## Orientation

This node examines what happens when policing is asked to manage a situation that is:

- politically unprecedented,  
- legally unsettled, and  
- emotionally charged at a civilisational level.  

From late 2023 onward, UK policing has been required to respond simultaneously to:

- mass protest framed as genocide prevention,  
- evolving international legal findings (ICJ, ICC),  
- heightened terrorism risk narratives, and  
- inconsistent or opaque guidance from central government and institutions.

What follows is not an accusation of individual malice.  
It is an analysis of **how uncertainty propagates through policing systems**, and how that uncertainty can harden into overreach.

---

## The core problem: uncertainty defaults to severity

When frontline officers and commanders face unclear boundaries, several predictable dynamics emerge:

- **Ambiguity is interpreted conservatively**  
  If the line is unclear, the safest personal option is to assume risk.

- **Precedent outweighs context**  
  Previous escalations become the template for future decisions, even when circumstances differ.

- **Responsibility migrates upward**  
  Officers defer to “national security,” “counterterrorism,” or “someone above my pay grade.”

- **Proportionality erodes quietly**  
  The question shifts from *“Is this necessary?”* to *“What if we miss something?”*

This is not exceptional behaviour.  
It is how complex organisations behave under pressure.

## Why Palestine-related policing became especially distorted

Several factors converged to make Palestine solidarity activity particularly vulnerable to misclassification:

- **Conflation of antisemitism policy with public order guidance**  
  Inconsistent understanding of IHRA/JDA distinctions filtered unevenly into policing practice.

- **Terrorism frameworks standing “adjacent” to protest policing**  
  Even when not formally invoked, their presence influences tone, thresholds, and escalation.

- **Narrative instability at the state level**  
  As “Israel acting in self-defence” became harder to sustain internationally, uncertainty increased domestically.

- **High-profile arrests creating informal precedent**  
  Once a few cases are escalated, others are treated as comparable by default.

The result is a situation where **policing behaviour appears to change faster than the law itself**.

---

## Risk assessment as a moving target

Risk assessment is not static.  
It is shaped by what police believe other parts of the state are doing.

Where universities, government departments, or other institutions appear to treat certain sites or protests as **national security concerns**, policing adapts accordingly.

This can produce cascading effects:

- Protesters or students become “known” within systems as risks  
- Subsequent encounters are framed through that prior classification  
- De-escalation becomes less likely, not more  
- Terrorism powers feel closer, even if legally unjustified  

Over time, **risk is no longer assessed afresh**.  
It is inherited.

---

## Transparency gaps and their consequences

A recurring issue since 2024 has been the mismatch between:

- **formal statements** (FOI responses, public assurances), and  
- **observable practice** (security presence, arrest patterns, escalation levels).

Where explanations are absent or implausible, policing is left exposed.

This matters because:

- policing legitimacy relies on public intelligibility, not secrecy  
- unexplained severity invites speculation and mistrust  
- officers become the visible face of decisions they did not make  

In such conditions, **policing absorbs political risk**, often unfairly.

---

## How this intersects with CPPCG obligations

Under Article I of the CPPCG, prevention is not optional.

When individuals or groups act under a good-faith belief that they are:

- preventing genocide, or  
- reducing complicity in atrocity crimes,  

the state bears a heightened responsibility to ensure that policing responses do not:

- suppress lawful prevention activity,  
- criminalise early warning signals, or  
- chill participation in atrocity documentation and protest.

Where policing uncertainty results in overreach, the risk is not only civil-liberties harm —  
it is **structural failure of prevention duties**.

---

## What this is *not*

This node does **not** claim that:

- all policing actions were unlawful,  
- all officers acted improperly, or  
- terrorism legislation can never apply.

It does claim that **systemic uncertainty**, left uncorrected, will reliably produce injustice — even without intent.

---

## Diagnostic signals to watch for

You are likely seeing “policing an unknown” when:

- officers cite policy that does not clearly apply  
- different forces respond radically differently to similar activity  
- escalation is justified by reference to *possibility*, not evidence  
- decisions rely heavily on “guidance” rather than statute  
- no one can clearly explain who set the threshold  

At that point, the issue is no longer individual judgment.

It is system design under stress.

---

## Why this node matters

If left unaddressed, this pattern produces three outcomes:

1. **Normalisation of exceptional powers**  
2. **Erosion of trust between communities and police**  
3. **Increased exposure to authoritarian capture**

None of these outcomes enhance safety.

They merely reduce uncertainty for the system, at the expense of justice.
