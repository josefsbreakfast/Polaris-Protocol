*How overreach happens without villains — when uncertainty hardens into authority.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines what happens when policing is asked to manage a situation that is simultaneously:

- politically unprecedented,  
- legally unsettled, and  
- emotionally charged at a civilisational level.  

From late 2023 onward, UK policing has been required to respond to mass protest framed as genocide prevention while operating amid:

- evolving international legal findings (ICJ, ICC),  
- heightened terrorism narratives,  
- inconsistent institutional signals, and  
- a widening gap between public rhetoric and legal reality.  

What follows is not an accusation of individual malice.  
It is an analysis of **how uncertainty propagates through systems**, and how that uncertainty can quietly solidify into overreach.

---

## ⚖️ The Core Problem: Uncertainty Defaults to Severity  

When frontline officers and commanders face unclear boundaries, several predictable dynamics emerge:

- **Ambiguity is interpreted conservatively**  
  Where the line is unclear, the safest professional option is to assume risk.

- **Precedent outweighs context**  
  Earlier escalations become templates, even when circumstances differ materially.

- **Responsibility migrates upward**  
  Decisions are deferred to “national security,” “counterterrorism,” or “someone above my pay grade.”

- **Proportionality erodes quietly**  
  The operative question shifts from *“Is this necessary?”* to *“What if we miss something?”*

None of this requires bad intent.  
It is how complex organisations behave under pressure.

## 🍉 Why Palestine-Related Policing Became Especially Distorted  

Several factors converged to make Palestine solidarity activity unusually vulnerable to misclassification:

- **Policy bleed between antisemitism guidance and public-order policing**  
  Inconsistent understanding of IHRA / JDA distinctions filtered unevenly into practice.

- **Counter-terrorism frameworks standing adjacent to protest policing**  
  Even when not formally invoked, their presence shapes tone, thresholds, and escalation logic.

- **Narrative instability at the state level**  
  As the “Israel acting in self-defence” frame weakened internationally, domestic uncertainty increased.

- **Early high-profile arrests creating informal precedent**  
  Once some cases were escalated, later ones were treated as comparable by default.

The result is a situation where **policing behaviour appeared to change faster than the law itself**.  

---

## 📑 Policy Atmosphere: Project 2025, Project Esther, and the Normalisation of Securitised Dissent

During this same period, a number of policy documents and briefings were circulating within transatlantic political and think-tank ecosystems that framed Palestine solidarity activity as an internal security risk rather than a civil-liberties issue.  

In the United States, Project 2025 and its associated initiatives — including Project Esther — advanced a model in which campus protest, anti-Zionist organising, and certain forms of journalism were conceptualised through counter-extremism and national-security lenses.  

While these projects are not UK government policy, their arguments were widely discussed, cited, and echoed across shared policy spaces, conferences, media commentary, and allied think-tank networks in the UK and Europe.  

This matters not because such documents were formally adopted, but because they helped **normalise a particular way of seeing dissent** — one in which protest against genocide, colonialism, or state violence is reinterpreted as destabilising, radicalising, or security-relevant by default.  

In an environment already marked by legal uncertainty and political discomfort, **the circulation of these frameworks made escalation feel reasonable, precautionary, and professionally defensible** — even where the law itself had not materially changed.  

The risk is not covert coordination, but conceptual alignment:  

When the same assumptions are “in the air,” systems can drift together without anyone explicitly directing them to do so.  

On a background of widespread, historically-normalised anti-Palestinian racism dating from the British Mandate period, and the expansion of British colonial policing and attitudes to Empire subjects under that Mandate, as well as nascient upper-class and legal profession antisemitism in the style of semi-philosemitic Christian Zionism, these policies were not subject to the rigorous scrutiny one might expect.  

This is how it was possible for their information basis to be sparse and their methodological process to be lacking, and yet their policy suggestions taken up so readily.  

---

## 🧮 Risk Assessment As A Moving Target  

Risk assessment is not static.  
It is shaped by what police believe other parts of the state are doing.

Where universities, government departments, or allied institutions appear to treat certain sites or protests as **security-relevant**, policing adapts accordingly.

This produces cascading effects:

- individuals become “known” within systems as risks,  
- future encounters are framed through inherited classification,  
- de-escalation becomes less likely, not more,  
- terrorism powers feel closer even when legally unjustified.  

Over time, **risk is no longer assessed afresh**.  
It is inherited.

---

## 🧾 Transparency Gaps and Institutional Drift  

A recurring feature since 2024 has been a mismatch between:

- **formal statements** (FOI responses, public assurances), and  
- **observable practice** (security posture, arrest patterns, escalation levels).  

These statements do not originate from policing alone.  
They arise across the **entire institutional layer** — universities, regulators, government-aligned bodies, and departments.

Where explanation is absent, vague, or implausible:

- policing absorbs political risk,  
- officers become the visible face of decisions they did not set, and  
- legitimacy erodes through confusion rather than confrontation.  

This is compounded by a wider problem:  
**a wartime rhetorical posture operating within peacetime law**.

Without clear, centralised guidance reconciling rhetoric, policy, and statute, uncertainty becomes systemic.

Policing cannot carry this alone.  
Leadership is required to re-anchor the system.

---

## 🎓 MOD-Adjacent Precedent and Risk Propagation  

Where university campuses are informally treated as defence-adjacent or asset-sensitive space, a precedent is set.

That precedent propagates through policing systems:

- deployment assumptions (“how many officers last time”),  
- risk flags and annotations,  
- and future response thresholds.  

Once a person or site has been associated with “national security relevance,” that classification can persist — even where underlying activity is lawful, non-violent, and protest-based.

This is not a conspiracy.  
It is **how precautionary systems function**.

The difficulty is that what began as site-based caution can become **person-based inheritance**, including for journalists engaging sources who may themselves be flagged.

---

## ⚖️ Equality Impact and Baseline Securitisation  

In this context, it must be stated clearly:

By definition, Palestinian identity — or being racialised as Palestinian — is securitised at a higher baseline unless one explicitly endorses state violence against Gaza.

This produces foreseeable equality impacts:

- heightened scrutiny of Palestinian students and staff,  
- spillover onto Muslim, Arab, and brown communities more broadly,  
- and disproportionate exposure to policing escalation.

Where protest securitisation disproportionately affects a specific ethnic group, **equality impact assessment is not optional**.

Failure to anticipate and mitigate this impact constitutes a governance failure, even absent discriminatory intent.  

When this co-occurs during active military-perpetuated assaults onto Palestinian civilians across Palestine, including Gaza, British Palestinians and Palestinian diaspora in the UK are being expected to manage:  
- the anticipation of potential death or injury to family and friends in Palestine;
- being flattened to a political talking point by geopolitical news;
- having one's own identity being treated as risk and marker in environments using "diversity" as the rationale;
- being the target group of a credible genocide, perpetrated by an ally of the UK;  
- having own's own mourning, and appropriate anger at suffering, be treated as "inappropriate", made illegal, and securitised.

Asking someone to manage this emotional and cognitive complexity, and expecting them to always be the height of civility and politeness, is inhumane.  

Expecting this of people at risk of genocide, strongly suggests that that risk is not taken with the seriousness it deserves.

## 🪬 Rebound Effects on Jewish Dissent  

This dynamic does not protect Jewish communities.  
It destabilises them.

As Palestinian expression is increasingly policed:

- Jewish students and staff are implicitly locked into a foreign state narrative,  
- dissenting Jewish voices become more isolated and more visible,  
- crossing even mild lines (“genocide is bad”) becomes higher risk, and  
- alt-right actors gain cover to target Jewish dissenters under the guise of “community conflict.”

This multiplies risk:

- doxxing and harassment increase,  
- antisemitic violence is easier to obscure,  
- and genuine community safety is degraded rather than enhanced.

Securitisation here **creates the harm it claims to prevent**.  

Given the specific histry which tools like the IHRA seek to protect, the foregoing of this standard in order to secure specofiv military narratives can be deeply concerning for the diasporic "middle ground", without producing loud outputs.  

---

## 💔 Police Wellbeing and Moral Injury  

This period has also imposed significant ethical strain on policing.

Officers have been asked to:

- police grief, trauma, and genocide discourse,  
- operate under unclear or shifting guidance,  
- absorb political risk they did not create, and  
- enforce decisions that diverge from everyday norms of public-order policing.

This produces **moral injury** — the psychological harm that arises when individuals are required to act against their ethical understanding of their role.

Common outcomes include:

- procedural rigidity as self-protection,  
- reduced tolerance for ambiguity,  
- faster escalation to avoid professional risk.

These are survival adaptations — but they increase the likelihood of overreach.

## 📦 Arrest Pattern Snapshot (contextual, non-exhaustive)

> **Purpose:**  
> This table illustrates pattern and clustering, not guilt or innocence.  
> It shows how escalation logic propagated across journalism, protest, and student activity.  

The arrests in this table are laregly of white/passing people who have been subject to arrest, where they have discussed their arrest in the public domain, and who have not required retraction of that information for their own safety.  

As this node is framed to policy and policing spaces in the UK, this should serve to highlight how the escalation is evident.  

We should be very clear, however, that many more people have been arrested, many repeatedly. Many registered professionals have been reported repeatedly to their professional bodies. Many have received complaints where there normally are none to record in their workplaces.  

There have been several arrests of doctors, and several activists have faced repeated arrests; many of whom have faced repeated doxxing, harrassment, and had personal life difficulties which are difficult to explain succinctly to police, and for which would require specialist skills to investigate in policing.  

This table will be updated; some dates are held as I need to retrace initial dates via media sources and check which are in public domain at this time.  

The alt-right activity in both Summer 2024 and Summer 2025 mens that some people who have been subject to significant unprecedented arrests, particularly women who are racialised in the UK, have made bespoke decisions around public knowledge to manage their personal safety as far as they are able to.  

What is notable is that with Project Esther in the policy space (which later fails and undermines Jewish safety, demonstrably, in the US, with the ADL facing in-house push-back for its support), there is the use of the Terrorism Act as a legal instrument, whilst after the Shawcross Report is releeased, whilst imperfect, the legal instruments are altered, but the physicality of policing increases.  

| Date (first arrest / raid) | Individual / Group | Role / Activity | Legal framing used | Notes relevant to this node |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 20 Oct 2023 | Tony Greenstein | Journalist / author | Terrorism Act | Early test case; critique of IHRA and Zionism. Jewish antizionist |
| 06 Aug 2024 | Filton 10 | Direct action (arms factory disruption) | Terrorism Act | Core group; later arrests and hunger strikes |
| 14 Aug 2024 | Richard Barnard | Palestine Action co-founder | Terrorism Act | Non-violent direct action |
| 15 Aug 2024 | Richard Medhurst | Journalist | Terrorism Act | Reporting / analysis; previous OSINT and Wikileaks coverage |
| 29 Aug 2024 | Sara Wilkinson | Journalist / author | Terrorism Act | Gaza reporting |
| 17 Oct 2024 | Asa Winstanley | Journalist | Terrorism Act | Raid; devices seized. Jewish antizionist |
| 01 Nov 2024 | Haim Bresheeth | Activist | Terrorism Act | Protest-related |
| 15 Nov 2024 | Natalie Strecker | Activist | Terrorism Act | Protest-related |
| 19 Nov 2024 | Further Filton activists | Direct action | Terrorism Act | Second Filton cluster |
| Jan - Feb 2025 | PSC national march | Protest participants; inc. John McDonnell MP, Jeremy Corbyn MP, and Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos | Questioning / detention | Unclear operational outcomes, march changed to standing protest short notice. Shortly followed Shawcross Report |
| 16 Apr 2025 | Yael Kahn | Protester, affiliated to IJAN | Public Order | Complainant party from Chabad, framed as intracommunity |

Patterns include repeated arrests, inherited risk, and escalation across roles.

## 🧄 Risk Untagging and Reset (what correction looks like)  

Correction does not require humiliation or admissions of bad faith.

It requires **procedural reset**:

- review and removal of inherited risk tags where no evidence exists,  
- explicit separation between protest, journalism, and terrorism frameworks,  
- guidance updates reflecting international legal developments,  
- permission to de-escalate without career penalty.

Risk, once applied, must be capable of being **unwound**.

---

## 🌀 Why This Feels Chaotic From The Inside  

From within institutions, this period feels fragmented rather than coordinated:

- no single authority clearly “owns” the problem,  
- guidance arrives late or indirectly,  
- reputational risk flows downward,  
- escalation feels safer than restraint.

This is not conspiracy.  
It is **system stress without leadership**.

---

## 🗺️ CPPCG Implications  

Article I of the CPPCG establishes a positive duty to prevent genocide.

Where lawful prevention activity is chilled, criminalised, or misclassified under terrorism frameworks, the failure is not only civil-liberties harm.

It is **structural prevention failure**.
