*(Where universities quietly intersect with defence, jurisdiction, and securitisation)*

---

## 🧭 Node role  

**infrastructure / jurisdiction diagnostic**

- explains why university protest sites are not neutral civic space  
- maps how defence, research, and policing jurisdictions overlap  
- isolates this issue from arrests and prosecutions (by design)

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

- why this node is separate  
- why this topic is volatile  
- why silence here reads as embarrassment, not secrecy  

---

## 🏗️ Universities as dual-use infrastructure  

- universities as research & development sites  
- historic and ongoing MOD / defence integration  
- why “civilian space” is an incomplete description  

---

## ⚖️ Jurisdiction confusion  

- overlapping authorities (university / local police / MOD / others)  
- why jurisdictional ambiguity escalates responses  
- how unclear ownership produces conservative (heavy) policing  

---

## 🧱 Securitisation without explanation  

- how security decisions are made without public narrative  
- why lack of explanation fuels speculation  
- difference between classified secrecy and unexplained silence  

---

## 🐘 Why this is awkward to discuss  

- reputational risk to universities  
- political sensitivity of defence-linked research  
- why no institution wants to be “the one” to clarify  

---

## 🚨 System-wide effects  

- how this spooks local policing ecosystems  
- how exceptional treatment becomes informal precedent  
- how future protest is reclassified as higher risk by default  

---

## 🧩 What this node is not  

- not an allegation of conspiracy  
- not a claim of uniform MOD control  
- not a judgement on protest legitimacy  
- not a substitute for arrests or policing analysis  

---

## 🧭 How this connects to other nodes  

- why this must be read *before* arrest-pattern analysis  
- how it feeds into misrecognition dynamics  
- why it matters for CPPCG/IHL interpretation

*Campuses, assets, and things no one wants to explain* is a contextual node within the **Polaris Protocol**.

It exists to separate **infrastructure realities** from **behavioural judgement**, and to prevent misattribution of motive where jurisdictional ambiguity is sufficient explanation.

*Silence is not the same as secrecy.*  
*Infrastructure shapes response.*
