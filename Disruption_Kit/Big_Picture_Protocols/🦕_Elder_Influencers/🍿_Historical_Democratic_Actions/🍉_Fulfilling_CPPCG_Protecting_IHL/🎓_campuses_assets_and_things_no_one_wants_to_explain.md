*(Where universities quietly intersect with defence, jurisdiction, and securitisation. Shhhh.)*

## 🧭 Node Role  

**Infrastructure / jurisdiction diagnostic**

This node explains why certain university protests were treated as exceptional security events rather than ordinary public-order situations.

It focuses on:
- defence-adjacent research environments  
- jurisdictional ambiguity  
- securitisation without explanation  
- downstream effects on equality, risk assessment, and civil liberty  

This node is intentionally separated from arrest analysis.  
It explains **conditions**, not individual decisions.

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

During the wave of Palestine Solidarity encampments, several university sites were managed as if they posed risks beyond protest activity.

Observers noted:
- unusually high or sustained security presence  
- inconsistent explanations across institutions  
- reluctance to clarify which authority held responsibility  

What stood out was not security alone, but the absence of a coherent public account of *why* those measures were necessary.

This silence does not behave like classified secrecy.  
It behaves like institutional discomfort with explanation.

---

## 🏗️ Universities as Defence-Adjacent Infrastructure  

Many universities host:
- defence-funded research  
- dual-use scientific and technical projects  
- sensitive data environments  
- partnerships with MOD-linked bodies  

These arrangements are lawful, longstanding, and widespread.

However, they complicate the assumption that campuses function solely as neutral educational space. Where a site is treated internally as asset-sensitive, protest activity may be reframed — quietly — as an infrastructure-protection issue rather than a public-order one.

This reframing is rarely made explicit.

---

## ⚖️ Jurisdictional Ambiguity as an Escalation Driver  

Once a campus is informally treated as hosting protected assets, jurisdiction becomes unclear.

Questions arise such as:
- is this local policing or infrastructure protection?  
- who carries responsibility if something goes wrong?  
- which response would be punished most harshly in hindsight?  

In such conditions, institutions tend to default to **over-coverage** rather than restraint.

This does not require coordination or intent.  
It emerges from shared risk aversion.

---

## 🧱 Securitisation Without Narrative  

In several cases, heightened responses were implemented without a corresponding public explanation.

Key features of the pattern include:
- unclear jurisdictional authority  
- no articulation of the specific risk being mitigated  
- no acknowledgement of defence-adjacent context  

This creates a paradox:
- the response appears exceptional  
- but the rationale is not publicly intelligible  
- because explanation would require acknowledging uncomfortable overlaps between civilian education, defence research, and protest rights  

The result is silence, which amplifies uncertainty rather than containing it.

---

## 🧾 Transparency, FOI, and Narrative Gaps  

In multiple instances, universities have responded to FOI requests with figures or descriptions of security provision that appear difficult to reconcile with contemporaneous visual evidence.

Open-source material — including video and photographic content shared publicly — has shown security coverage that appears more extensive, specialised, or sustained than some institutional disclosures suggest.

This does not, on its own, demonstrate bad faith.

However, it does create a **gap in narrative justification** between:
- what institutions report  
- and what observers can see in real time  

Where security posture is invoked, explicitly or implicitly, as part of a risk assessment, this gap matters.

---

## ⚖️ Why This Gap Matters in Terrorism-Related Contexts  

Under counter-terrorism frameworks, perceived risk plays a central role in:
- escalation decisions  
- policing thresholds  
- restrictions on liberty and movement  

Where individuals face investigation, arrest, or charging under terrorism legislation, transparency around the **actual security context** becomes especially important.

This is not a demand for operational disclosure.  
It is a requirement of proportionality and accountability.

If exceptional security conditions are relied upon to justify exceptional measures, the broad contours of those conditions must be intelligible.

Without that clarity:
- risk assessments cannot be meaningfully scrutinised  
- escalation decisions appear arbitrary  
- trust in institutional judgement erodes  

Transparency here is not voyeurism.  
It is a safeguard for civil liberty.

---

## 🧮 Risk-Assessment Drift and Associative Tagging  

Where campuses are treated as defence-adjacent or asset-sensitive, risk classification does not remain spatial.

It becomes **associative**.

Individuals present at, organising, or repeatedly associated with such sites may be:
- recorded as linked to “national security–relevant” environments  
- subject to heightened scrutiny in future encounters  
- assessed under lower ambiguity thresholds  

This can occur even where activity is lawful, non-violent, and protest-related.

Risk classifications, once applied, are difficult to unwind — particularly where the original rationale was never explicit.

---

## 🧿 Racialised Securitisation and Equality Risk  

It is important to be explicit about who is structurally affected by securitisation in these contexts.

Palestinian identity — and those racialised as Palestinian — is more likely to be securitised where Gaza’s destruction is framed as a security imperative.

In practice, unless a Palestinian individual publicly endorses the bombing of Gaza, they are likely to be assessed as higher-risk than the general population by default.

Where protest policing and security escalation disproportionately affect a specific ethnic group, an equality impact assessment is not optional. It is a procedural necessity.

Failure to anticipate and mitigate disparate impact is a governance failure, even absent discriminatory intent.

---

## 🏛️ Executive Coordination and Due Diligence  

It is publicly known that a meeting took place at 10 Downing Street involving university vice-chancellors during the period in which encampments were being actively managed.

It is reasonable to assume relevant departments were engaged. Given defence-linked research within UK academia, MOD consultation would not, in itself, be inappropriate.

Bringing materially affected stakeholders into the same room is not the governance failure.  
The governance failure arises where downstream effects are unequal and unaccounted for.

Once securitisation following high-level coordination produces racially differentiated outcomes, due diligence is triggered regardless of intent.

---

## ⚖️ Dual Duties Engaged: International and Domestic  

At this stage, obligations arise on at least two independent bases:

- **International duties** (CPPCG; and the wider context of ICJ provisional measures): states have positive prevention duties and should not obstruct credible prevention activity through disproportionate securitisation and chilling effects on speech, documentation, and protest.

- **Domestic equality duties** (including the Public Sector Equality Duty): public bodies must have due regard to eliminating discrimination and avoiding unjustified disparate impact.

Good faith does not negate obligation.  
Process still has to be defensible.

---

## 🕊️ Trauma, Timing, and Avoidable Harm  

A further concern is the degree to which some actions taken against encampments were incompatible with trauma-informed practice.

Publicly documented incidents include:
- protest spaces dismantled in symbolically violent ways  
- enforcement or possession actions timed on Nakba Day  
- disregard for the fact that participants were receiving real-time news of family members being killed or displaced  

For Palestinian communities, these actions were not experienced as neutral enforcement.  
They were experienced as **re-enactment**.

Symbolic violence does not require intent.

---

## 🔁 Risk Multiplication Across Communities  

These dynamics also rebound onto Jewish communities — particularly dissenting Jews.

As Palestinian identity is securitised, Jewish students and staff who articulate anti-genocide or anti-Zionist positions are pushed into narrowing corridors of acceptable opinion.

This can:
- lock Jewish identity to a foreign state’s narrative, regardless of personal belief  
- frame dissent as emotional, destabilising, or illegible  
- increase exposure to harassment and doxxing  

Most dangerously, it can create cover for violent antisemitism by allowing attacks on dissenting Jews to be misread as “internal conflict” rather than targeted hate.

Risk multiplies rather than dissipates.

---

## 🚓 Resource Strain and Escalation Bias  

Elevated risk frameworks are resource-intensive. They require:
- more officers  
- more senior oversight  
- tighter procedural compliance  
- heavier reporting burdens  

In stretched environments, this creates escalation bias:
upgrading response is administratively safer than downgrading it.

Disproportion becomes structural.

---

## ⚠️ When Subjectivity Hardens Into System Error  

Where early risk inputs rely on stakeholders later shown to hold strong ideological positions, subjectivity can harden into institutional fact.

Downstream effects include:
- automatic escalation  
- lowered prosecutorial thresholds  
- constrained judicial framing  

Justice can miscarry **by process**, without intent.

---

## 🗺️ CPPCG Mapping (Article I — Duty to Prevent)  

### Individual layer  
Citizens, journalists, academics, and activists may interpret prevention duties as raising alarm, documenting harm, or disrupting complicity. Criminalising such action without necessity risks penalising compliance.

### Institutional layer  
Universities and police must avoid suppressing early-warning signals through opaque securitisation and unmanaged equality impact.

### State layer  
States must ensure counter-terrorism frameworks do not obstruct genocide-prevention duties or international legal obligations.

---

## 🧭 What Correction Looks Like (Without Humiliation)  

Correction does not require spectacle. It requires:
- re-baselining risk assessments and removing inherited tags where no new evidence exists  
- clarifying evidentiary thresholds separating protest from genuinely violent activity  
- updating guidance to decouple political dissent from extremism frameworks  
- restoring proportionality as the default posture  

Policy refinement, not denial.
