# 🧱 Predation Logic — Vulnerability, Power, and Targeting
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*Why sexual violence follows power lines, not gender lines.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node explains the actual operating model of sexual predation:  
**access + vulnerability + impunity = opportunity for abuse**.

It challenges the false idea that sexual violence is driven by sexual attraction or identity.  
Instead, it shows why predators target:
- women  
- trans women  
- trans men  
- nonbinary people  
- boys and men  
- institutionalised people  
- disabled people  
- detainees  
- anyone without protection  

This is the real architecture.

## ✨ Key Features
- Predation as a power calculus  
- Why gender is not the determining factor  
- How institutions create opportunity  
- The role of secrecy and impunity  
- Why marginalised groups are targeted disproportionately  
- Implications for survivor-led policy and culture

## 🧿 Analysis / Content

### 1. Predators act where they have power
They choose victims who lack:
- credibility  
- mobility  
- protection  
- institutional backing  

### 2. Predation is about domination, not desire
Rape is a tactic of:
- humiliation  
- control  
- torture  
- subjugation  

It thrives in institutions with no oversight.

### 3. Gender shapes vulnerability, not causality
Women face epidemic rates — but men and boys are also targeted when conditions allow.

### 4. Impunity is the key factor
Predators calculate:
“Will I get away with it?”

If the system enables them, they act.

### 5. Understanding predation logic strengthens all survivor advocacy
It:
- protects male survivors from erasure  
- supports trans survivors with accuracy  
- avoids misgendered assumptions  
- focuses on systems rather than identities  
- improves policy arguments  
- dismantles myths used to silence victims
