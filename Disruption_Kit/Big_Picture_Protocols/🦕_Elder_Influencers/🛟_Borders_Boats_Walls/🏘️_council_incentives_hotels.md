*How austerity-era cuts and ring-fenced grants shape local authority involvement in asylum accommodation.*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Councils are not running an asylum hotel gold rush.  
- They are operating under austerity scars, where any ring-fenced grant looks like survival money.  
- The placement of asylum hotels in small towns is political: it generates friction, resentment, and headlines.  

---

## Funding Flows  

### Dispersal Grants  
- Councils receive ~**£1,200 per asylum seeker** annually.  
- Additional payments for new bedspaces (e.g. **£3,500 per new occupied bed** during 2023–24 scaling).  
- Funding is ring-fenced but often insufficient to cover actual community service costs.  

### Emergency Hotels  
- Hotels are contracted by the Home Office through providers (Serco, Mears, Clearsprings).  
- Councils have little say over placement but must absorb community impact.  
- They receive small mitigation funds, not the bulk of £3bn+ hotel spend.  

### Austerity Context  
- Local authority budgets were cut by **20–40% in real terms** since 2010.  
- Many councils are now effectively bankrupt (Section 114 notices).  
- Accepting dispersal grants is often less about enthusiasm than avoiding collapse.

## Why Communities Feel the Strain  

1. **Small Town Placement**  
- Hotels often sited in deprived towns, not cosmopolitan cities.  
- Ensures friction where resources are already stretched.  

2. **Lack of Consultation**  
- Councils are bypassed in Home Office decisions.  
- Residents feel blindsided, asylum seekers isolated.  

3. **Political Amplification**  
- Far-right groups stage protests outside hotels.  
- Media amplifies disruption to sustain “crisis” narrative.  

---

## Why This Matters  
- The *appearance* is that councils are “cashing in.”  
- The *reality* is austerity hollowed budgets, leaving authorities desperate for ring-fenced funds.  
- The *effect* is community resentment, used as fuel for national crisis theatre.  

---

## Counterarguments & Rebuttals  
- “Councils benefit financially.” → In practice, contractors take billions; councils get mitigation scraps.  
- “Hotels are unfair on locals.” → Hotels are a symptom of backlog and outsourcing, not a council choice.

*🏘️ Council Incentives Hotels* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how austerity-era cuts and ring-fenced grants shape council incentives, and how placements are weaponised to radicalise communities.
