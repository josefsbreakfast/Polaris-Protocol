**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Historical casefile of the UK Identity Cards Act 2006, its costs, Cabinet churn, repeal in 2010, and lingering data risks.*  

---

## 1. Timeline & legal instruments  
- **2002–2006** — Policy development; **Identity Cards Act 2006** establishes the National Identity Register (NIR) and ID card scheme.  
- **2008–2009** — Limited roll-out: regional pilots; ID cards issued to residents and foreign nationals.  
- **2010–2011** — Coalition repeals scheme via **Identity Documents Act 2010**. NIR officially destroyed, ID cards invalidated.  

---

## 2. Harms & governance risks  
- **Cost spirals** — multi-billion projections; flagged by NAO and select committees.  
- **Cabinet churn** — reshuffles fractured responsibility; Andy Burnham defended costs but lacked continuity.  
- **Civil-liberties clash** — NO2ID campaign + cross-party opposition.  
- **Zombie data worries** — subcontractor datasets may have persisted after destruction orders.

## 3. Lessons  
- Large biometric ID systems produce enduring vulnerabilities even when repealed.  
- Political ownership diffuses risk but guarantees weak delivery.
