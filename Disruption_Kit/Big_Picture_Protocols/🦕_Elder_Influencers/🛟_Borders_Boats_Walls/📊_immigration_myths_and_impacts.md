## 🌀 Section 1 — General Myths  
These myths dominate headlines and political soundbites, but the numbers tell a different story. Most are not rooted in law or data, but in deliberate simplifications that keep anger aimed downward.  

| ❌ Claim | ✅ Reality | 📊 Data |
|----------|------------|---------|
| “Most are economic migrants.” | Recognition rates 47–76% (2022–24); small-boat claims ~68%. | Migration Observatory |
| “They must stop in the first safe country.” | No such rule in the Refugee Convention. Art. 31 forbids penalties for irregular entry. | UNHCR |
| “UK takes the most.” | Per capita far lower than Germany or France. | Eurostat |
| “They should apply legally.” | No visas exist for Syria, Sudan, Afghanistan, Eritrea. | HO policy |
| “Luxury hotels, easy ride.” | £49/week allowance; hotels often unsafe/unfit. | NAO |
| “They clog the NHS.” | NHS pressure comes from cuts + ageing population, not asylum seekers. | IFS |

## 🏘️ Section 2 — Local Impact  
At the community level, the same myths are recycled in different form — usually to justify austerity or pit locals against new arrivals. The financial flows show something else: councils are squeezed, but not because of asylum seekers themselves.  

| ❌ Claim | ✅ Reality | 📊 Data |
|----------|------------|---------|
| “They cost councils.” | Grants ~£1,200/person; austerity is the real squeeze. | HO dispersal |
| “Hotels are a free ride.” | £3bn+/yr flows to contractors, not asylum seekers. | NAO |
| “They should wait their turn.” | Backlog averages 400+ days. | Migration Observatory |
| “We did it legally, why can’t they?” | Safe routes narrowed since 2000s. | HO visa policy |

## ⚖️ Section 3 — Legal Brief + Case Snapshots  
Migration is framed as exceptional, but the law shows continuity: coercive control at borders echoes coercive control in domestic law. Human rights protections are not abstract — they have been used to hold the UK accountable across disasters, violence, and surveillance.  

- **UK law:** coercive control (Serious Crime Act 2015) — a frame to describe border manipulation.  
- **Refugee Convention:**  
  - Art. 31 — no penalties for irregular entry.  
  - Art. 33 — non-refoulement.  
- **ECHR:**  
  - Art. 2 → Hillsborough, Grenfell inquests (right to life).  
  - Art. 3 → Warboys ruling (protection from degrading treatment).  
  - Arts. 10–11 → Sarah Everard vigil (expression, assembly).  
  - Art. 8 → Big Brother Watch (privacy).

## 🌋 Section 4 — What’s at Stake  
Stripping away these rights does not just affect asylum seekers. It weakens accountability across the board: for disasters, police failures, protest rights, privacy, and fair trial. The border becomes the testing ground for shrinking protections everywhere.  

- Losing ECHR protections weakens accountability across deaths, policing, protest, privacy, fair trial.  
- ❓ Open question: *If these rights vanish — who benefits?*
