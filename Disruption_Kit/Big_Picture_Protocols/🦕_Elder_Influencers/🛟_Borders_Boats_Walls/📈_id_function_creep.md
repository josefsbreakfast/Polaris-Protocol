# 📈 ID Function Creep  
**First created:** 2025-10-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*When identification expands faster than justification.*  

---

## 🧭 Purpose  

**ID Function Creep** tracks how systems built for limited verification quietly expand their reach — from passports to welfare cards, from workplace log-ins to border surveillance.  
Each expansion is framed as efficiency or safety, but every extension rewrites the boundary between identification and control.  

This node documents the **incremental widening** of data mandates across sectors and age groups, showing how “temporary” or “optional” measures become default infrastructure.

## 🧩 Early Examples  

| Context | Initial Purpose | Expansion Path | Resulting Risk |  
|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|  
| National ID Schemes | Citizenship proof | Linked to welfare, voting, travel | Universal tracking potential |  
| School Pass Systems | Attendance monitoring | Linked to payments and discipline | Behavioural profiling |  
| Border Biometric Trials | Immigration control | Adopted for tourism and domestic travel | Mass data retention |  
| Workplace Access Cards | Security | Integrated with payroll and productivity analytics | Labour surveillance |

## 🌐 The Pattern  

Function creep does not announce itself.  
It hides in *updates*, *policy alignment*, *technical harmonisation*.  
By the time public debate begins, the new boundary is already the baseline.  

Tracking this pattern is essential to any **risk-containment strategy** in the metadata domain.

## 🌌 Constellations  

📈 🔥 🧿 🧮 — Structural constellation of governance drift, incrementalism, and data control.

*📈 ID Function Creep* is a living node of the *Polaris Protocol.*  
It maps the incremental broadening of identification infrastructures and their rebranding as convenience or safety.
