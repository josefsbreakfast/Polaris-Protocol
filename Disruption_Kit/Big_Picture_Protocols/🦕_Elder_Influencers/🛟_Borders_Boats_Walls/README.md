# 🛟 Borders, Boats & Walls  
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Migration and border containment logics: coercive control, liability shields, harm-reduction frames, and the contractor economy.*  

---

## 🌍 Overview  

Borders are not boundaries; they are **systems of permission**.  
They decide who may move, who must wait, and whose life is rendered negotiable.  

This cluster maps the **border-industrial complex** — the network of policy, profit, and narrative control that turns migration into a managed spectacle.  
From hotel detention contracts to “harm-reduction” rhetoric, it exposes how containment is sold as compassion, and how migration management becomes a commercial product.  

---

## 🔥 Core Threads  

- **Coercive care:** safeguarding and humanitarian language used to justify restriction.  
- **Containment as industry:** profit pipelines through hotels, detention, and service outsourcing.  
- **Liability deflection:** anti-migrant rhetoric used to shield elite and state accountability.  
- **Historical persistence:** ID systems and partition logics as prototypes for digital borders.  
- **Counter-logics:** survivor-led harm-reduction routes and solidarity infrastructures.  

---

## 🧩 Structural Logic  

Borders operate as **testing grounds for governance experiments** later redeployed across welfare, policing, and data systems.  
They fuse legal exceptionalism, moral theatre, and commercial capture — turning movement itself into a managed variable.

## 🧭 Context & Purpose  

The *🛟 Borders, Boats & Walls* cluster documents how migration control functions as a **mirror of governance**:  
a reflection of how states manage dissent, distribute risk, and monetise fear.  

It seeks to:  
1. **Trace coercion through care** — identifying where humanitarian language conceals control.  
2. **Expose financial architectures** — following public funds through contractors and shell companies.  
3. **Connect survivor testimony** — situating lived experience within global containment circuits.  
4. **Archive counter-strategies** — harm-reduction, legal refusal, and solidarity logistics.  

Borders, boats, and walls are not external fortifications; they are domestic feedback loops of control.
