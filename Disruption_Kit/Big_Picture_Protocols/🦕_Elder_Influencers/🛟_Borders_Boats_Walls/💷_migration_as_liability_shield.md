# 💷 Migration as Liability Shield  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*How anti-migrant policy serves to deflect reparations and shield elite wealth while shifting costs onto taxpayers.*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Migration policy is not only about borders — it is about money.  
- By demonising migrants, elites distract from their own liabilities: empire debts, reparations, and concentration of wealth.  
- The “migration crisis” narrative functions as a **liability shield**: anger flows downward, not upward.  

---

## Mechanisms of the Shield  

### 1. **Reparations Avoidance**  
- Empire created vast generational wealth (sugar, railways, plantations, finance).  
- Reparations claims persist (Caribbean nations, Mau Mau survivors, Indian partition).  
- Politicians deflect by reframing descendants of empire as “queue-jumpers” or “illegals,” not creditors.  

### 2. **Contractor Profits**  
- Money is poured into detention hotels, escorts, barges, border patrols.  
- Contracts go to Serco, G4S/Allied Universal, Clearsprings, Mears, Capita.  
- Profit is privatised, risk socialised.  

### 3. **Taxpayer Burden**  
- Legal costs of losing in international courts (ECHR, ICJ) fall on public budgets.  
- Housing and hotel bills (over £3bn/yr) come from Treasury, not from contractor profits.  
- Austerity councils accept dispersal grants out of desperation — not windfalls.  

### 4. **Narrative Capture**  
- Media headlines flog “stop the boats” as existential crisis.  
- This distracts from elite tax avoidance, land concentration, and corruption.  
- Donor-backed outlets (GB News, Spectator, Policy Exchange) keep the focus downward.

## Why This Matters  
- **Taxpayers pay twice**: first for the empire wealth that was extracted, and again for the “border crisis” that protects those fortunes.  
- **Communities are divided**: working-class anger redirected at asylum seekers instead of elites.  
- **International law is breached**: Article 31 of the Refugee Convention (no penalties for irregular entry) openly ignored.

## Counterpoints & Rebuttals  
- “It’s about fairness, not money.” → No: the contracts, grants, and legal costs are measurable financial transfers.  
- “We can’t afford reparations.” → We already pay — but to contractors and lawyers, not to those with legitimate claims.
