# 🧭 Migration Crisis as a Consultancy Revenue Environment

*How prolonged migration crises create structural demand for classification, control, and optimisation services.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node reframes the so-called “migration crisis” as a **governance market**.

Prolonged migration instability generates sustained demand for:
- population classification,
- triage and prioritisation,
- risk scoring,
- logistics optimisation,
- crisis governance frameworks.

These conditions disproportionately benefit large consultancies.

---

## 🚧 Crisis as Permanence  

Migration is rarely treated as:
- predictable,
- structural,
- or resolvable through solidarity-based policy.

Instead, it is framed as:
- emergency,
- overflow,
- threat,
- capacity failure.

This framing:
- suspends normal safeguards,
- legitimises exceptional measures,
- and creates long-term consultancy dependence.

---

## 🧠 Classification as the Primary Product  

In migration governance, consultancies rarely “solve” migration.

They provide:
- classification systems,
- prioritisation schemas,
- desirability and risk segmentation,
- throughput optimisation.

This transforms migrants from:
- rights-bearing subjects  
into  
- managed populations.

---

## 🏛️ Alignment with Authoritarian Power (Structural)  

Authoritarian and far-right political actors benefit from:
- faster classification,
- reduced consent,
- securitised framing,
- diminished equality constraints.

Consultancy outputs — even when framed as neutral — are:
- more easily deployed in such regimes,
- more rapidly capitalised under such conditions,
- less constrained by civic law.

This creates **structural alignment**, not ideological agreement.

---

## ⚖️ Tension with the Equality Act  

The Equality Act 2010:
- constrains proxy use,
- requires proportionality,
- foregrounds discriminatory impact.

Migration consultancy systems:
- rely on proxies correlated with race, nationality, poverty,
- treat exclusion as efficiency,
- externalise harm as “trade-offs”.

This is not accidental.
It is a **business model conflict**.

---

## 🛑 Core Claim (Plain Language)

> Prolonged migration crises function as revenue environments for consultancies by sustaining demand for classification, control, and optimisation systems. These systems are structurally incompatible with equality-based civic law and are readily appropriated by authoritarian governance agendas.

*🧭 Migration Crisis as a Consultancy Revenue Environment* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how prolonged migration instability is transformed into sustained demand for classificatory governance systems that undermine civic equality and democratic accountability.
