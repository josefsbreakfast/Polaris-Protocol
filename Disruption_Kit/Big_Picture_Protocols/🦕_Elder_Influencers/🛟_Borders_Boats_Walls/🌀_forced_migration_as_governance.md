# 🌀 Forced Migration as Governance  
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*How empire displaced populations to fracture cohesion and control labour.*

## 📖 Definition  

Empire did not simply “divide and conquer” by stoking rivalries.  
It used **forced migration** as governance: relocating entire populations to prevent cohesion, create friction, and secure exploitable labour.  

These were not accidents of logistics. They were deliberate strategies of control.

## ⏳ Case Studies  

- **Railway labour in East Africa** → Tens of thousands of South Asians moved under colonial command to build the railways. Many died. Their remains were rarely repatriated; burial rites disrupted.  
- **Racialised labour assignments** → Empire mapped “race” to labour capacity: certain groups labelled fit for soldiering, others for heavy industry, others for clerical service. Idi Amin was one such product of racialised grooming.  
- **Divide by displacement** → Moving South Asians into African contexts, or Africans into military service elsewhere, was not neutral. It manufactured friction, animosity, and prevented solidarity.

## 🪦 Cultural Sabotage  

Forced migration was also a sabotage of ritual and belonging:  

- **Hindu cremation** → Bodies never returned to the Ganges.  
- **Islamic burial** → Timely burial before sundown often blocked.  
- **Ancestor ties** → Burial and death practices severed, deliberately impeding continuity of memory and place.

## 🧭 Continuities Today  

- Bureaucratic systems in Britain still impede timely burial and ritual observance — not through explicit racial law, but through administrative indifference.  
- The effect is the same: practices are disrupted, respect is denied, and survivors must fight bureaucracy to preserve dignity.

## 🔗 Polaris Relevance  

Forced migration shows governance as displacement.  
Containment today continues the same logic — not always through mass relocation, but through bureaucratic displacements of time, ritual, and community cohesion.

*Forced Migration as Governance* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how empire displaced populations to prevent cohesion, and how ritual sabotage remains embedded in bureaucratic systems today.
