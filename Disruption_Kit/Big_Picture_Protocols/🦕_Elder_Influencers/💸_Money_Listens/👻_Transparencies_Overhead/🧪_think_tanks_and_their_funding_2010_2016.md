# 🧪 Think-Tanks & Their Funding (2010–16)  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-04  
*Mapping the think-tanks that shaped UK counter-extremism policy during 2010–2016, their funding sources, and how their ideological agendas influenced Prevent and the CTSA framework.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Between 2010 and 2016, UK counter-extremism policy was shaped not by:

- independent academic research,  
- transparent public inquiry,  
- or democratic consultation,

but by a **small cluster of think-tanks** with:

- opaque funding,  
- ideological missions,  
- geopolitical agendas,  
- disproportionate political access.

This node examines the major actors and the financial/political forces behind them.

## 🧩 Key Think-Tanks & Funding (2010–16)

### **1. Quilliam Foundation**  
**Role:**  
- Dominant influence on early Prevent training and CTSA-era guidance.  
- Provided ideological templates for “radicalisation vulnerability.”

**Funding:**  
- US government grants (publicly confirmed).  
- Foreign government support (Egypt, UAE — confirmed in media investigations).  
- Private donors (names withheld).  
- Foundations linked to counter-extremism networks.

**Influence:**  
- Defined many risk indicators inside Prevent.  
- Briefed Parliament extensively.  
- Positioned itself as “the Muslim voice,” despite poor community legitimacy.

---

### **2. Policy Exchange**  
**Role:**  
- Produced research on extremism that heavily framed Muslim communities.  
- Coined narratives used in early Prevent communications.

**Funding:**  
- Extremely opaque.  
- Known donors include corporate sponsors, finance sector actors, and US conservative foundations.  
- Does not disclose full donor list.

**Influence:**  
- Provided the intellectual framing for “British values” and “non-violent extremism.”  
- Cited repeatedly by Conservative ministers.

---

### **3. Henry Jackson Society (HJS)**  
**Role:**  
- Shaped foreign policy-oriented extremism narratives.  
- Promoted hardline counterterror positions.

**Funding:**  
- US right-wing foundations including the Gatestone Institute (identified in investigative reporting).  
- Private donors with strong Israel/US defence policy links.  
- Corporate patrons.

**Influence:**  
- Fed ideological material into Parliamentary debates.

---

### **4. Civitas**  
**Role:**

- Promoted critiques of multiculturalism.

**Funding:**  
- Conservative-aligned donors, corporate contributors.  
- Does not publish complete donor data.

**Influence:**  
- Provided the “integration failure → extremism risk” narrative widely adopted in media and political spaces.

---

### **5. Demos (Centre for the Analysis of Social Media)**  
**Role:**  
- Provided early analysis of online extremism.  
- Less ideological than others, but still shaped metadata-based policy logic.

**Funding:**  
- Mixed: UK govt grants, tech-sector sponsorship, philanthropic foundations.  
- More transparent than others but still politically aligned.

**Influence:**  
- Gave policymakers a techno-solutionist lens on “digital radicalisation.”  
- Helped normalise metadata use in counter-extremism.

---

### **6. Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD)**  
**Role:**  
- Worked on online extremism research and community resilience projects.  
- Less central to CTSA, but influential post-2015.

**Funding:**  
- EU projects, US-based foundations, philanthropy, Google/Meta partnerships.  
- Significant US influence.

**Influence:**  
- Provided digital methodology that fed into Prevent’s expansion into online monitoring.

## 🧩 Patterns: What These Think-Tanks Shared

### **1. Opaque funding**  
None of the groups disclosed full donor lists.  
Foreign funding — especially US and Gulf sources — was common.

### **2. Ideological slant**  
Framed extremism primarily through:

- Muslim identity,  
- cultural difference,  
- distorted integration narratives,  
- securitised multiculturalism.

### **3. Outsized political access**  
They briefed:

- Home Secretaries,  
- Select Committees,  
- Special Advisers,  
- media outlets.

### **4. Weak community legitimacy**  
None of these think-tanks were trusted within the communities most affected.

### **5. Policy laundering**  
Ideological assumptions became “research findings,” then became “expert briefings,” then became *law*.

## 🧪 Case Window (Non-Attributable Patterns)

*Synthesised from public reporting, parliamentary records, FOI revelations — no personal data.*

- Quilliam’s “vulnerability factors” reproduced almost verbatim in CTSA guidance.  
- Policy Exchange briefs cited in Prevent refresh documents.  
- HJS influence evident in parliamentary speeches on “non-violent extremism.”  
- Civitas shaping “integration” discourse in media-political cycles.  
- Demos and ISD feeding digital-risk frameworks into policy.

## ⚖️ Democratic Implications  

### **• Policy influenced by unaccountable actors**  
Think tanks are private bodies — not democratically elected, not publicly answerable.

### **• Foreign-funded organisations shaped domestic CT law**  
Raises sovereignty and legitimacy concerns.

### **• Ideological narratives substituted for evidence**  
The law was not based on empirical research, but on politically convenient stories.

### **• Communities affected had no voice**  
Muslim, Arab, Black, South Asian, and Jewish communities were discussed — not consulted.

### **• Prevent’s architecture is inseparable from these influences**  
To understand Prevent is to understand its think-tank origins.

## 🧠 Constellations  
**🧪 Policy Capture** — private influence over public law.  
**🌑 Racialised Governance** — ideological suspicion of minorities.  
**🛰️ Intelligence Logic** — metadata and early-indicator frameworks.  
**⚖️ Democratic Integrity** — lack of transparency in policymaking.
