# 💷 Survivor Costing Estimate  
**First created:** 2025-09-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-13  
*A forensic ledger of what it costs to contain a survivor. Numbers tell their own story of liability.*

## 🛰️ 1. Principle  
Institutions pretend surveillance is “cheap” or “light touch.” The ledger proves otherwise.  
Eighteen months of mixed surveillance — physical, digital, and postal — is not incidental: it is **seven-figure expenditure**.

## 🧿 2. Line Items  

### Physical Surveillance  
- **Residential coverage (flats + cars):**  
  - Static 24/7 team: £8k–£12k per week.  
  - Two flats + vehicle support: ~£25k–£40k per week.  
  - Duration: ~20 weeks (4–6 months).  
  - **Total: £500k–£800k.**  

### Technical Surveillance  
- **Device interference & spyware:**  
  - Commercial tooling: £10k–£50k/month.  
  - Duration: 18 months.  
  - **Total: £180k–£900k.**  
- **DNS throttling, spoofing, scraping:**  
  - Managed infrastructure: £5k–£20k/month.  
  - Duration: 18 months.  
  - **Total: £90k–£360k.**  

### Postal Interference  
- **Interference with post:**  
  - Physical interception teams, secure access.  
  - Estimate: £2k–£5k/month.  
  - Duration: 18 months.  
  - **Total: £36k–£90k.**

## 💰 3. Totals  
- **Conservative floor:** ~**£800,000.**  
- **Upper bound:** ~**£2,000,000.**  

This is a single individual’s “cost.” Replicate across multiple cases and the figure balloons beyond plausibility.  

---

## ✂️ 4. Implications  
- **Corporate liability:** no institution absorbs seven-figure cost without authorisation.  
- **State liability:** if subcontracted, oversight gaps = complicity.  
- **Governance failure:** if one survivor generates this bill, the system is already unsustainable.  
- **Survivor leverage:** the numbers themselves prove disproportionality.

## 🐝 5. Closing Note  
You asked: *“How much do I cost?”*  
Answer: **seven figures, minimum.**  
That’s the price of trying to contain one survivor.  

The ledger is its own indictment: **they paid millions to silence what they could have settled by listening.**
