# 🔮 Magical thinking as an economic operating system  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*How faith in self-correcting markets, infinite growth, and innovation-as-salvation became a governing ideology rather than a cognitive error.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines **magical thinking** not as a rhetorical insult, but as a *structural operating system* embedded in modern economic governance.

From late-20th-century deregulation onward, a recurring belief set emerges:
- markets naturally self-correct  
- growth is both inevitable and benign  
- risk can always be redistributed  
- innovation will resolve material constraints  
- consequences can be deferred without cost  

These beliefs persist even when repeatedly falsified by crisis.

The result is not learning, but **recursion**: the same assumptions reassert themselves after each collapse, intensifying harm while claiming inevitability.

## ✨ Key Features  

- Defines magical thinking as a **systemic belief pattern**, not individual irrationality  
- Traces continuity from 1980s finance culture to contemporary growth theology  
- Explains why economic crises do not dislodge core assumptions  
- Links abstraction, intoxication, and optimism bias to policy failure  
- Establishes magical thinking as a driver of Ouroborotic Violence

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Magical thinking is not ignorance — it is entitlement  

Magical thinking in economics does not appear as naïveté.  
It appears as **confidence without accountability**.

Typical expressions include:
- “The market will adjust.”  
- “This time is different.”  
- “We’ve priced the risk.”  
- “Innovation will catch up.”  
- “Growth creates its own solutions.”  

These statements function less as hypotheses and more as **protective spells** — invoked to avoid confronting limits.

---

### 2. The 1980s: intoxication meets deregulation  

The late 20th century introduced a potent mix:
- financial deregulation  
- speculative instruments  
- aggressive leverage  
- cultural excess  
- widespread stimulant use  
- techno-optimism  

This period normalised:
- exaggerated confidence  
- risk underestimation  
- belief in personal exceptionalism  
- dismissal of long-term consequences  

Economic modelling quietly absorbed these attitudes, converting *vibes* into equations.

### 3. Crisis does not break the spell — it reinforces it  

Dot-com collapse.  
Housing bubble.  
Global financial crisis.  
Climate destabilisation.  

Each event should have triggered epistemic revision.

Instead, the response pattern repeats:
1. Crisis framed as anomaly  
2. Core assumptions left untouched  
3. Same logic reapplied at greater scale  
4. Blame displaced onto external factors  

This is why magical thinking belongs in **Ouroborotic Violence**:  
the system consumes itself while insisting nothing is wrong.

---

### 4. Why maths becomes a talisman  

Economic abstraction allows belief to masquerade as rigor.

Complex models:
- obscure underlying assumptions  
- distance decisions from physical reality  
- create authority through opacity  

When challenged, defenders point to the maths — not to material outcomes.

But mathematics describes relationships.  
It does not override physics, biology, or geology.

When models fail repeatedly yet remain dominant, the issue is not technical error.  
It is **faith masquerading as science**.

---

### 5. Growth theology as secular religion  

By the late 20th century, growth ceased to be a strategy and became a moral good.

Growth promises:
- salvation from scarcity  
- redemption from limits  
- perpetual improvement  
- avoidance of grief and loss  

Questioning growth is treated as heresy, not analysis.

This is not accidental.  
Magical thinking thrives where confronting finitude is psychologically intolerable.

---

### 6. Why this thinking persists  

Magical thinking survives because it:
- protects elite interests  
- delays accountability  
- externalises harm  
- flatters power  
- avoids grief  

It allows systems to continue extracting even as foundations erode.

From within the system, stopping looks like failure.  
From outside, continuing looks like madness.
