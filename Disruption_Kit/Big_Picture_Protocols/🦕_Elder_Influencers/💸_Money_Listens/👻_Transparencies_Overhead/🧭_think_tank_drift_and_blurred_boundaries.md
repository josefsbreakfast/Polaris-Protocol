# 🧭 Think-Tank Drift and Blurred Boundaries  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-04  
*How mainstream policy spaces slid closer to transformation projects 2018–2024.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Ideological boundaries between traditional conservatism and hard-right transformation projects thinned significantly in the late 2010s–2020s.  
This node maps that drift — structurally, not accusatorily.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Boundary liquefaction in policy ecosystems  
- Why some actors perceive clarity as operational threat  
- How Overton-window engineering exploits confusion  
- Consequences for book suppression and intellectual climate

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. The Drift  
Cross-pollination occurred through:
- staffing overlaps  
- shared donors  
- narrative coordination  
- media ecosystems  
- political volatility  
- online radicalisation spillover  

### 2. Why This Matters  
When boundaries blur:
- moderates misread extremists as allies  
- radicals mask as policy innovators  
- transformation projects gain cover  
- institutionalists lose control of tone  

### 3. Why Clarifying Books Are Threats  
Books that:
- name authoritarian drift  
- clarify structural patterns  
- re-anchor democratic norms  
- expose incoherent messaging  
…are operationally inconvenient to actors running long-horizon projects.

### 4. Overton Engineering  
Boundary drift enables:
- tone-hardening  
- narrative simplification  
- friend/enemy sorting  
- escalated moralising  
- recruitment across multiple disillusioned groups
