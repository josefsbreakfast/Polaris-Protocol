## 🛰️ Pattern Summary

- **Shielded / Opaque** → ~1 major office (Prime Minister).  
- **Active or recently investigated** → 2 cases (Reeves, Kyle).  
- **High-Exposure donations** → 1 (Wes Streeting).  
- **Fully transparent** → majority of mid-level portfolios.  

Blind-management and partial disclosure protocols re-emerged as **Cabinet-level standardisation tools** in 2024, following a wave of ethics controversies under the previous government.

## 🧱 The “Statutory Blind-Trust Model” Narrative (2024)

### 🗓 Background
In mid-2024 the Starmer administration announced a *“statutory blind-trust option”* for ministers, framed as a reform to improve clarity and reduce discretionary judgment in managing conflicts of interest.  
It coincided with the rewrite of the **Ministerial Code (2024 Revision)**, which expanded the Independent Adviser’s remit and codified disclosure categories.

### 🧭 Policy Intent
1. **Streamline** conflict management by encouraging ministers with significant private holdings to move them into blind-management arrangements overseen by certified trustees.  
2. **Reduce discretion** by formalising guidance on what counts as a “qualifying asset” or “sensitive holding.”  
3. **Protect security-sensitive investments** (e.g. tech, energy, defence sectors) from public mapping that might expose strategic assets or partners.  
4. **Signal integrity** to voters by asserting that ministers “no longer control nor know” their own portfolios.

### 🩸 Criticisms
| Domain | Core Concern |
|---------|--------------|
| **Transparency advocates** | Argue that “blind” structures *reduce visibility rather than conflict*: the public cannot verify what has been sequestered or how trustees are chosen. |
| **Investigative journalists** | Note that the scheme *recentralises opacity* in the Cabinet Office, creating new FOI exemptions under “confidential trust arrangements.” |
| **Ethics lawyers** | Warn that the system lacks *statutory enforcement or audit rights*—trust deeds are private, not reviewable by Parliament. |
| **Economists & governance scholars** | Call it *an optical fix*: risk moved from political exposure to fiduciary concealment. |
| **Survivor-advocacy & Polaris analysts** | View it as **containment-by-credential**—a narrative of probity that simultaneously *erases evidentiary trace* of financial entanglement. |

### 🧨 Effect
- **Public trust decreased**: polling mid-2025 shows 62 % of respondents believe ministers still hold undisclosed financial stakes.  
- **Accountability diffused**: media and parliamentary committees cannot compel production of underlying trust documents.  
- **Regulatory risk**: aligns UK practice with *US-style discretionary blind trusts* without corresponding audit infrastructure.

*📜 UK Cabinet Conflict & Opacity Map (2025)* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It traces how transparency reforms convert scrutiny into narrative containment, using legal and procedural instruments to manage visibility rather than eliminate conflict.
