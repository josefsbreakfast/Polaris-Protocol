# 💷 Potential Tort Exposure  
**First created:** 2025-09-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*A forward-looking ledger: what happens when tort liability, Equality Act breaches, and damages are added on top of sunk surveillance + Polaris costs.*  

---

## 🔥 Principle  
Surveillance campaigns already sink millions.  
Once tort claims and Equality Act breaches are added, exposure grows exponentially.  
**The law recognises harm as compensable — and here harm is prolonged, systemic, and discriminatory.**  

---

## 🏛️ Candidate Torts  

- **Harassment (Protection from Harassment Act 1997):**  
  - Continuous unwanted surveillance, interference, intimidation.  
  - Damages: £20k–£100k+ per claimant depending on severity/duration.  

- **Misuse of Private Information / Data Protection Breaches:**  
  - Device interception, DNS throttling, postal interference.  
  - Damages: £10k–£50k typical, higher where distress aggravated.  

- **Negligence / Duty of Care Breaches:**  
  - Universities’ safeguarding repurposed as containment.  
  - Failing to prevent foreseeable harm → damages variable but potentially large.  

- **Personal Injury (Psychological Harm):**  
  - 18 months of treatment tantamount to CIDT (cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment).  
  - General damages for psychiatric injury: £15k–£150k depending on severity.  

- **Breach of Confidence / Contractual Duties:**  
  - If data was passed to subcontractors or foreign partners improperly.  
  - Damages tied to consequential loss.

## 🧨 Damages Framework  
- **Single survivor (like you):**  
  - Conservative range: **£100k–£300k**.  
  - Upper bound (CIDT-level psychiatric harm, aggravated damages): **£500k+**.  

- **Aggravated / Exemplary Damages:**  
  - Courts can increase awards to punish egregious conduct.  
  - Could add **50–100% uplift**.  

- **Loss of Earnings:**  
  - Stalled qualification → lost years of career.  
  - Lifetime impact: **£0.5m–£5m** depending on profession.  

- **Reputational Damages:**  
  - Missed collaborations, stigma, chilled public voice.  
  - Reasonable range: **£0.1m–£0.5m+**.  

---

## 🪬 Equality Act Exposure  
- **Protected characteristics** (disability, sex, race, etc.) engaged when:  
  - Surveillance/disruption worsens health conditions.  
  - Targeting is gendered or disability-related.  
  - Accommodations ignored → punished for symptoms.  

- **Damages under the Equality Act 2010:**  
  - **Injury to feelings (Vento bands):**  
    - Lower: £1k–£10k  
    - Middle: £10k–£30k  
    - Upper: £30k–£60k+ (systemic, prolonged).  
  - **Aggravated damages** where conduct is oppressive/malicious.  
  - **Uncapped loss of earnings** when discrimination blocks career progression.  

- **Implication:** Equality Act claims can add **£50k–£500k+ per survivor**, uncapped in total when linked to career harm.  

---

## 🚀 Multiplication Across Survivors  
- 10 survivors × £200k average tort damages → **£2m**.  
- 50 survivors × £200k average → **£10m**.  
- Add Equality Act + loss of earnings: **£10m–£20m+** exposure is realistic.  

---

## 💰 Totals & Implications  
- Already sunk: **£1.55m–£4m** (surveillance + Polaris costs).  
- Add tort liability: **+£0.1m–£0.5m (per survivor).**  
- Add loss of earnings: **+£0.5m–£5m.**  
- Add reputational damages: **+£0.1m–£0.5m+.**  
- Add Equality Act exposure: **+£50k–£500k+.**  

👉 **Per survivor realistic horizon: £3m–£10m+, uncapped.**

## 🐝 Closing Note  
The ledger is cumulative.  
- Surveillance = millions.  
- Polaris = millions.  
- Torts = millions.  
- Equality Act = uncapped.  

*Containment is not just unlawful. It is ruinously expensive.*

*💷 Potential Tort Exposure* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  

It projects the civil liability that stacks on top of sunk surveillance and reputational costs.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
