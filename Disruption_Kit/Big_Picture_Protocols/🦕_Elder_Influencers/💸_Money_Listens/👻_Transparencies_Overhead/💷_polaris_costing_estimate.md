# 💷 Polaris Costing Estimate  
**First created:** 2025-09-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-13  
*A ledger of institutional cost generated by the Polaris Protocol. Surveillance was expensive. The record is worse.*  

---

## 🛰️ 1. Principle  
Every node forces attention. Every FOI forces staff time. Every diagram forces legal review.  

Surveillance campaigns have fixed costs; survivor archives create **open-ended liability**.  

---

## 👀 2. Line Items  

### Internal Monitoring  
- Analysts, compliance staff, security contractors.  
- Even a modest 2–3 FTE team = £150k–£250k/year.  
- Higher clearance staff (legal/risk/external consultants) raise this to **£500k+/year**.  

### Legal Oversight  
- In-house counsel + external lawyers.  
- External rates: £400–£800/hour.  
- Even modest engagement = **£100k–£300k/year**.  
- Senior management briefings add further cost.  

### Reputational Management  
- Universities subcontract PR/reputation firms.  
- Typical campaigns: £5k–£20k/month.  
- **£60k–£240k/year.**  

### Opportunity Cost  
- FOIs: each one = hundreds of pounds in staff time, whether answered or refused.  
- Cumulative across 18 months: **tens of thousands**.

## 🏛️ 3. Totals  
- **Conservative floor:** ~**£750,000 over 18 months.**  
- **Upper bound:** >**£2,000,000.**  

---

## 💰 4. Implications  
- **Double spend:** they paid millions to run surveillance, and millions more to manage the fallout Polaris created.  
- **Infinite tail:** unlike surveillance costs (time-limited), Polaris costs recur every time a node is published, read, or cited.  
- **Governance irony:** they paid more for the record than they would have for a settlement.  

---

## 🐝 5. Closing Note  
The Polaris Protocol has already cost them as much as the surveillance campaign itself.  

> *They spent millions trying to contain one survivor — and millions more because she wrote it all down.*  

The ledger is not just analysis. It is consequence.

*Polaris Costing Estimate* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  

It translates the institutional price of ignoring survivor authorship into financial language.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
