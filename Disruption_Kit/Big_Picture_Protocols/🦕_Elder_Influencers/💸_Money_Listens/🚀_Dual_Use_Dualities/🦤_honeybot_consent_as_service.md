# 🦤 HoneyBot: Consent-as-Service  
**First created:** 2025-10-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*A satirical dual-use prototype exploring the commodification of consent under current legal and tech frameworks.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**HoneyBot: Consent-as-Service (CaaS)** is a fictional—but legally plausible—product concept designed to expose how *data governance, contract law, and wearable tech* already allow the outsourcing of consent itself.  

The premise: what if consent could be treated as a **subscription tier**?  
What if bodily autonomy were mediated by **terms of service**, machine learning predictions, and "ethical" APIs?  

The satire draws directly on contemporary practices in app-based labour, biometric surveillance, and platform “trust & safety” language.  
If it feels absurd, that’s because it already exists — only less honestly branded.

## 🔥 Concept Overview  

### 🧠 Product Summary  
**HoneyBot: Consent-as-Service™** — a wearable and cloud-integrated data product enabling “mutual consent assurance” through smart contracts, real-time monitoring, and behavioural nudging.

- **Core Offer:** Users opt into tiered consent packages (“Standard”, “Enhanced”, “Premium Safety+”).  
- **Mechanism:** Biometric signals and communication logs are analysed to predict “likely willingness.”  
- **Output:** A “Consent Certificate” tokenised on-chain, shareable between users and service providers.  
- **Monetisation:** Subscription model, plus “Risk Flag Resolution” upselling.  

> *Legal note:* Under most current jurisdictions, predictive or automated consent management remains permissible if user terms explicitly delegate autonomy to the system.

### 🪩 Ethical Sales Copy (Satirical)  
> *“Never be uncertain again.  
> With HoneyBot Consent-as-Service™, every touch, message, and interaction is pre-cleared and post-auditable.  
> True freedom is contractual transparency.”*

### 🧬 Forensic Commentary  
1. **Commodified Autonomy:** Turns human consent into a market object — a service to be outsourced rather than a right to be upheld.  
2. **Predictive Consent Loophole:** Exploits machine-learning forecasts as “reasonable proxy” for intent, a loophole in many jurisdictions.  
3. **Data Sovereignty Drift:** Moves bodily signals (heart rate, voice stress, gesture data) into shared corporate custody under “ethics tech.”  
4. **Moral Theatre:** Markets itself as safety technology while functionally serving liability transfer and behavioural control.  

---

_**Obviously**_, this is a ridiculous idea and there ought mever to be anything like this, as it is so obviously reminiscent of the worst of European and American histories, amongst others.  

However, we are continuously breaking our own "red lines" and we must treat these potentials with urgency, should we wish to reign in the worst of our urges.  

The world already tolerates similar practices across large populations, andd we must always move deliberately if we wish to live in true freedom.  

This can only be acheived when everyone is truly treated as worthy of safety.
