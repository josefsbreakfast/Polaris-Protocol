*Why “outlier” narratives mislead; how stacked biases punch holes in the net.*

## Core idea
Incarceration layers multiple destabilisers: induction shock, acclimatisation trauma, institutional blind spots, duration effects, and threshold drift. The coincidence of holes (Swiss-cheese model) produces preventable fatalities that are later framed as aberrations.

## Why this matters
Public focus on a few high-profile white male cases obscures structural harm and blocks abolitionist conversations grounded in data.

## Action prompts
- Demand life-course baselines, not incident-only reviews.  
- Publish standardised “hole maps” per facility.

## 🌌 Constellations
📜 🧠 🧿 — law, psychology, oversight.

## ✨ Stardust

A framing node to underpin policy and media responses without sensationalising cases.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
