# 🧾 Mass Symbolic Arrests — Street Processing & Cost Snapshot
**First created:** 2025-10-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-04  
*How passive-resistance arrests (lying down, relaxing the body) inflate police resource use, cost, and data capture.*

## 🛰️ Summary
Mass arrests where the 'offence' is symbolic expression (holding a placard signalling support for a proscribed group) are operationally cheap to describe and expensive to execute. Passive-resistance techniques by protesters (e.g., relaxing the body, going limp) force police to allocate multiple officers and prolonged processing time per person, raising officer-hours, vehicle use, custody booking overhead and the ultimate fiscal and intelligence yield.

## 🐼 Typical resource profile (conservative model)
- **Officers per arrest:** 4 (typical for a non-violent, passive-resistance pick-up).  
- **Processing time (on-scene / van):** ~1.5 hours.  
- **Per-arrest policing + booking + modest legal overhead (model):** ~**£785**.  
- **Command & opportunity overhead (capture displacement and senior resources):** multiplier ×2 → **£1,570 per arrest** (modelled).  
- **Example:** 488 speech-based arrests → **£0.38m (base)** to **£0.77m (with multiplier)**. Add downstream judicial and long-term costs and the operation moves into the low-millions.

## 👾 Effects & interpretation
- **Data capture priority:** The operational return is often intelligence (records, biometrics, device data), not convictions.  
- **Signalling:** Mass arrests become a deterrent policy and a narrative device — expensive but politically visible.  
- **Civil & human costs:** Arresting elderly, disabled, or Holocaust survivors is socially corrosive and increases reputational and legal risk for the force.  
- **Opportunity cost:** Patrol and response capacity elsewhere is displaced; public safety may be indirectly affected.

## Recommended documentation to collect (if building an evidentiary node)
- Timestamped arrest logs (ISO8601)  
- Number of officers recorded per arrest & vehicle IDs  
- Duration of on-scene processing per person  
- Booking outcomes (NFA, charge, caution, trial)  
- Any devices seized, biometrics recorded, or social network mapping noted  
- Medical / vulnerability notes for elderly/disabled arrestees
