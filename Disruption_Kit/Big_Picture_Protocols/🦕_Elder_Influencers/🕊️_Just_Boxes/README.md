*Justice boxes and justified boxes of containment.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  
This node examines how **containment is moralised** — how bureaucratic, legal, and technological “boxes” are sold as justice.  
It tracks the shift from **justice systems** to **justified systems**, where the act of classification itself becomes the performance of fairness.  

“Just boxes” are the **apparatus of reasonableness** that make control look ethical: safeguarding frameworks, moderation pipelines, eligibility criteria, and national security exceptions.  
Alongside these, it maps **counter-frameworks** — **harm reduction**, **transformational justice**, and **restorative justice** — which seek to restore repair, relational accountability, and dignity to spaces where institutional containment has replaced care.

## 🧶 Core Threads  
- **Containment as moral architecture** — the ethics of sorting, classifying, excluding.  
- **Justice-as-box** — when form replaces substance.  
- **Procedural compassion** — empathy as interface design.  
- **Justified box** — the enclosure defended as “care,” “safety,” or “due process.”  
- **Restorative counterlogics** — repair as refusal of containment.  
- **Transformational justice** — systemic accountability through relationship, not punishment.  
- **Harm reduction** — mitigation of systemic and interpersonal violence without coercion.

*🕊️ Just Boxes* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It explores how systems of justice transform into self-justifying enclosures — and how harm reduction, restorative, and transformational justice frameworks offer counterlogics of repair.
