# 🔺 Triangle of Accountability Gaps  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How UK surveillance, data, and charity law combine to let private monitoring operate without oversight.*

---

## 🛰 Orientation  
The *Demonstration and Event Monitoring Unit* of the Campaign Against Antisemitism sits inside a blind spot where three regulatory regimes meet but never overlap:  
- **Surveillance law (RIPA 2000)**  
- **Data-protection law (UK GDPR / DPA 2018)**  
- **Charity law (Charities Act 2011)**  

Each assumes the others are policing accountability.  
The result is a **lawful but unregulated zone** in which private groups can carry out public-space intelligence work under charitable auspices.

This diagram shows how raw protest footage becomes structured intelligence: filtered through classification decisions, then forwarded into formal enforcement or reputational-pressure channels.

## 🧿 Analysis  

| Domain | Legal premise | What it misses |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Surveillance law (RIPA)** | Only state actors need warrants for covert monitoring. | Private actors can observe, film, and record protests with no oversight. |
| **Data protection (GDPR / DPA)** | Processing of public-space data allowed under “legitimate interest.” | Treats political-speech footage as “crime prevention,” sidestepping Art. 9 special-category safeguards. |
| **Charity law** | Charities may defend their community or promote harmony. | Recasts surveillance as “charitable protection,” not enforcement. |

Together these create the **“Civic Surveillance Exemption Zone.”**

## 🪬 Governance Implications  

- **No proportionality test:** Activities look lawful until someone challenges them in court.  
- **No subject rights in practice:** Individuals filmed at protests rarely know data exist to request deletion.  
- **No oversight body:** The ICO regulates data retention, not mission scope; the Charity Commission regulates fundraising, not surveillance ethics.  
- **Cross-system invisibility:** Each regime treats the others as responsible for control, leaving a triangle of accountability vacuum.

---

## 🛟 Duty of Care and Oversight Risks  

Even where surveillance activity is carried out under legitimate-interest or charitable protection clauses, the absence of integrated governance exposes **volunteers and subjects alike** to harm.

- **Volunteer safety:**  
  Deploying untrained volunteers to observe or film protests can breach the sector’s duty of care.  
  Charities are expected to provide risk assessments, insurance, and legal briefing whenever participants enter high-risk or public-order environments.

- **Legal exposure:**  
  Without professional oversight, volunteers may inadvertently commit offences (harassment, data misuse) or mishandle special-category data.  
  Trustees remain legally responsible for foreseeable harm.

- **Reputational risk:**  
  A single incident involving volunteer injury or wrongful data use can trigger investigations by the Charity Commission or the ICO, undermining public trust.

This is where the **triangle becomes a void**: legal compliance exists on paper, but governance in practice disappears.

*🔺 Triangle of Accountability Gaps* is a living diagnostic node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It explains how UK surveillance, data, and charity frameworks intersect to create lawful yet unregulated civic-intelligence zones — enabling private groups to monitor public dissent without democratic oversight.
