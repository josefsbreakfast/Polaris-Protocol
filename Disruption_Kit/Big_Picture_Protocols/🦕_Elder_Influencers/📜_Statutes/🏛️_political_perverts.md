# 🏛️ Political Perverts  
**First created:** 2025-10-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*A satirical lens on the UK’s surveillance class: how ministers become addicted to their own warrants, stroking renewal papers every six months as if secrecy itself were a kink.*  

---

## 📂 Scope  

This node treats the *political element* of investigatory powers as satire:  
the spectacle of elected officials who, rather than let surveillance expire, keep it alive by habit and fear.  
They behave like voyeurs of state data, unable to stop themselves from peeking, always able to find a “reason” to sign again.

## 🗝️ Key Points  

- **Ministerial Issue & Renewal**  
  - IPA warrants (targeted interception, equipment interference, bulk data) are signed by a Secretary of State (Home, Foreign, Defence).  
  - Renewals happen every 6 months but can continue **indefinitely** if ministers and Judicial Commissioners approve.  

- **Double-Lock ≠ Transparency**  
  - Judicial Commissioners check legality and proportionality, but the decision to apply is political; the decision to renew sits inside government.  
  - There is no statutory “sunset” that forces disclosure to the subject.  

- **Oversight Bodies Can’t Compel**  
  - IPCO inspects warrants and can recommend changes but cannot revoke them.  
  - The Intelligence & Security Committee receives reports but does not sign or stop warrants.  
  - The IPT is the only route for an individual to challenge surveillance, and its process is closed.  

- **Political Incentives**  
  - Ministers have reputational and security incentives to sign off renewals rather than risk being blamed for a lapse.  
  - Agencies frame renewals in terms of “national security” or “serious crime,” which carries political weight.  
  - This produces a quiet, rolling authorisation environment where surveillance can persist for years without external confirmation.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🏛️ Political Perverts* is a satirical node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It preserves the forensic mechanics of surveillance renewals but frames them through the absurd lens of ministers as voyeurs of secrecy.
