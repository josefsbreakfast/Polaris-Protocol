# ⚖️ Norman Law and the Geometry of Impunity  
**First created:** 2025-11-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*How a feudal property skeleton still shapes who can be hurt - and who can litigate forever - in English law.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
English law did not fall from the sky; it grew out of **Norman feudalism**, where the core question was: *who owns this land, and who owes them service?*  
That history still governs modern corporate and data regulation. The system remains exquisitely good at protecting **owners** and far less interested in protecting **everyone else**.  

This node maps how that feudal geometry persists in everything from fiduciary duty to the new digital landlordism now branded as “tech feudalism.”

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Property-centric DNA:** law evolved to defend holders of land, then shares, now data.  
- **Fiduciary tunnel vision:** “best interests of the company” = shareholder primacy.  
- **Process as privilege:** the rich own time, lawyers, and appeals.  
- **Feudal residue:** hierarchy and deference baked into legal defaults.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1. From fief to freehold to financial asset  
Norman law organised power around land—who held it *of the Crown*, who paid homage, who owed what.  
Across centuries the substrate shifted:  
> **Land → Property → Corporate Equity → Data Assets.**  

What never changed was the **priority of possession**. Ownership remains the master grammar through which English law decides legitimacy and harm.

---

### 2. Fiduciary duty as modern homage  
Company directors still swear fealty—only now to shareholders instead of a lord.  
The legal test for virtue is profitability; acting for the public good without monetary benefit can be a breach of duty.  
Re-defining “best interests of the company” to include environmental, social, and data-integrity factors would be the first true de-feudalising reform.

---

### 3. Litigation stamina as a form of property  
Because the loser pays in civil procedure, **the capacity to litigate becomes a kind of estate**.  
Those who own time and money can convert process into impunity—endless appeals, strategic delays, threatened costs.  
Impunity is thus not a bug of English law; it is its oldest feature.

---

### 4. Ring-fencing the public as an exception  
Trust law and charitable status exist as work-arounds for a system that otherwise assumes all assets are private.  
Any attempt to create a public ring-fence (a climate fund, data trust, or oversight endowment) must first prove why it should escape the gravity of property.  
Stewardship remains a hack, not a default.

### 5. From Norman fief to digital fief — the rise of **Tech Feudalism**  
Modern data empires behave like their medieval ancestors:  

| Feudal Term | Digital Analogue | Function |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Fief** | Platform ecosystem | Territory of control |
| **Vassal** | Developer / influencer / partner | Sworn through contract not citizenship |
| **Peasant tenancy** | User account / data licence | Labour and rent paid in attention |
| **Castle & moat** | Proprietary APIs & lock-in | Structural barrier to exit |

As Yanis Varoufakis argues in *Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism (2023)*:  
> *The new lords are platform owners; the new serfs are everyone who must use their digital estates to work, trade, and socialise.*  

The Polaris reading: English law’s feudal geometry made this not an accident but a continuation.  
Property remains the organising principle; only the substrate—land → code → data—has changed.

*⚖️ Norman Law and the Geometry of Impunity* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It traces how the Crown’s feudal logic survives inside modern finance and digital architecture — a geometry that still decides who owns the courtroom, the platform, and the future.
