# ⚖️ Differential Proportionality  
**First created:** 2025-11-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How proportionality standards in surveillance and enforcement expand or contract depending on social power.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

“Proportionality” is the core safeguard of UK and European human-rights law:  
state interference with privacy or liberty must be **necessary**, **suitable**, and **no more intrusive than required**.  

In practice, however, proportionality is not evenly applied.  
The higher one sits in a social hierarchy—racially, economically, institutionally—the more procedural friction appears before coercive powers are used.  
For marginalised or politically inconvenient groups, the friction vanishes.

This node maps how proportionality operates as a *socially elastic principle* rather than a fixed legal standard.

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Elastic legality:** The same clause (“necessary and proportionate”) expands or contracts with political comfort levels.  
- **Perception bias:** Threat models built around class, race, or ideology skew what officials deem “necessary.”  
- **Procedural asymmetry:** Wealth and access to counsel slow state intrusion; poverty and stigma accelerate it.  
- **Epistemic shield:** Institutional familiarity (“people like us”) serves as an informal immunity from suspicion.  
- **Feedback reinforcement:** Each uneven application becomes precedent, normalising the bias.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1. Structural Elasticity  
In surveillance and policing, proportionality is theoretically neutral but practically political.  
For groups associated with terrorism, migration, or public disorder, the “risk” baseline is defined high—allowing invasive measures under terrorism or national-security law.  
When similar data-collection powers might implicate elite or corporate actors, proportionality is invoked as a brake: *“we must balance privacy against efficiency.”*

### 2. Class and Capacity  
Those with resources can:
- retain lawyers to challenge warrants or data access,  
- use private networks, encryption, or corporate legal privilege,  
- appeal through the Investigatory Powers Tribunal or Judicial Review.  
For ordinary citizens, especially minorities or activists, such recourse is theoretical.

### 3. Institutional Trust Loops  
Agencies extend more deference to actors that resemble themselves—professional, credentialed, “responsible.”  
That bias inflates proportionality concerns around “respectable” institutions while treating community groups or protest networks as inherently risky.

### 4. Datafication Feedback  
Machine-learning risk systems trained on historical policing data encode these asymmetries.  
Algorithms that weight prior contact with police as a risk factor perpetuate the same unequal proportionality in digital form.

### 5. Democratic Cost  
Unequal proportionality corrodes legitimacy:  
citizens learn that restraint applies upward, scrutiny applies downward, and “neutral” oversight language masks class and racial hierarchy.

*⚖️ Differential Proportionality* is a diagnostic node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces how the legal ideal of proportionality bends under social and institutional power, turning a safeguard into a mirror of hierarchy.
