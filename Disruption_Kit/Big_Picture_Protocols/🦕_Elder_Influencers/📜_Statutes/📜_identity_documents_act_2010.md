# 📜 Identity Documents Act 2010  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Repeal law that ended the UK Identity Cards scheme, mandating destruction of the National Identity Register.*  

---

## Overview  
- Came into force: **2010** under Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition.  
- Repealed the **Identity Cards Act 2006**.  
- Cancelled all UK national identity cards.  
- Mandated destruction of the National Identity Register (NIR).  

---

## Implementation  
- Destruction of the NIR completed in **2011**.  
- Only ~15,000 ID cards had been issued; all invalidated without refund.  
- Biometric residence permits (for foreign nationals) continued separately.  

---

## Lessons  
- Legislative repeal does not guarantee total deletion (vendor test data may persist).  
- Costly programmes can be scrapped within one election cycle, but data ghosts remain.
