# ‚öñÔ∏è Legality as Gaslight ‚Äî Section 17 & selective disclosure  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*On how legal compliance windows and selective non-disclosure (e.g., Section 17 transitions) can be weaponised to gaslight and retraumatise survivors.*

## Summary
This note critiques how legal and policy windows‚Äîwhere authorities claim they cannot disclose operational details for legal reasons‚Äîcan operate as a form of institutional gaslighting. Selective non-disclosure can withhold accountability, prolong uncertainty, and amplify harm, especially in cases of ongoing sexual/romantic impersonation and harassment.

## Key concerns
- **Selective silence:** ‚Äúwe cannot disclose‚Äù without remedies destabilises survivors.  
- **Temporal withholding as tactic:** delay until future legal date = postponement of remedy.  
- **Partial remedial action:** protecting property while ignoring personhood harms.  
- **Operational opacity + personal manipulation:** legal cover enables covert manipulation.  
- **Human-rights inversion:** presumption that potential risk negates transparency/dignity.

## Practical recommendations
1. **Interim disclosure baseline** (minimal confirmation of intervention + category).  
2. **Time-bounded non-disclosure** with mandated review date.  
3. **Independent oversight with emergency powers**.  
4. **Rights-respecting triage** (protect dignity first).  
5. **Mandatory incident reports** (to oversight bodies).  
6. **Appeal & safe counsel access** even during disclosure freezes.

## üèÆ Footer
*‚öñÔ∏è Legality as Gaslight* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how lawful-seeming non-disclosure practices can perpetuate harm, and it proposes governance and practical remedies to reduce retraumatisation while preserving legitimate security needs.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
