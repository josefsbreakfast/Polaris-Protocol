*Primary rationale for inclusion is to support why a Charity Commission concern form was raised.*

---

## 🛰️ *Orientation*  
A case examining *who should manage the property and affairs* of an 81-year-old woman (*OT*) lacking capacity due to advanced dementia.  
Both applicants sought appointment under the *Mental Capacity Act 2005 (s.19)* — the charity-linked *KKL Executor & Trustee Co Ltd* and the independent professional *Lynsey Harrison*.  

The judgment becomes a touchstone on *conflict-of-interest boundaries* for deputies, showing how charitable entanglements can override historic trust, even when fees are waived.

---

## 🧭 *Context*  
- *OT:* 81 years old, senile dementia, now in residential care.  
- *Diagnosis:* Dementia since 2015; incapacity confirmed by GP and social worker (COP3).  
- *Estate value:* ≈ £500 000.  
- *History:* Three wills (2005–2017), all drafted by KKL, naming them as executors and *JNF UK (Jewish National Fund UK)* as *residuary beneficiary*.  
- *Suspicious transactions:* ≈ £40 000 (no prosecution).  
- *Referral:* Leeds City Council referred to Harrison under its approved professional deputy scheme.

---

## ⚖️ *Issue*  
*Who should be appointed deputy under s.19 MCA 2005 — KKL (linked to the beneficiary) or Lynsey Harrison (independent professional)?*

---

## 🧩 *Legal Test*  
The court applied *s.4 MCA 2005 (best interests)* —  
- past and present wishes and feelings;  
- values likely to influence decisions if capacitous;  
- other factors OT would consider;  
- overall welfare (financial, emotional and ethical).

---

## 🧱 *Competing Positions*  

### 🩵 *KKL (Applicant)*  
- Longstanding relationship with OT (will writer, executor, pastoral visitor).  
- Shared *Jewish cultural values* and community links.  
- Offered to act *free of charge*.  
- Claimed OT’s repeated choice shows *deep trust* and continuity.  
- Alleged Harrison had a conflict as a *charging solicitor* using her own firm.  

### 💠 *Lynsey Harrison (Respondent)*  
- Appointed under a vetted *social services referral scheme*.  
- Raised concerns about *KKL’s lack of independence* from JNF UK (the will’s sole beneficiary).  
- Cited *Fundraising Regulator findings (Mar 2020)* showing blurred lines between KKL and JNF UK.  
- Noted KKL’s *inexperience* in deputyship procedure.  
- Emphasised need for *independent investigation* into Code breaches and possible *statutory will*.

---

## 🧮 *Judicial Analysis*  

### 1️⃣ *Capacity*  
OT lacks capacity — agreed and declared under *s.2 MCA 2005*.  

### 2️⃣ *Past Wishes & Values*  
Her wills show affinity with JNF UK, but weight reduced because the *Fundraising Regulator* found structural overlap and Code breaches undermining independence.  

### 3️⃣ *Conflict of Interest*  
KKL’s *dual role* (executor + beneficiary link) created a *clear and ongoing conflict*.  
This “magnetic factor” outweighed cost savings or cultural proximity.  

### 4️⃣ *Relationship Status*  
KKL was not a family-like figure. It fits the category of *professional adviser* but lacked the necessary independence.  

### 5️⃣ *Experience & Conduct*  
KKL showed *procedural inexperience* and errors (PD9B non-compliance).  
Harrison formed part of an established team handling 70 + deputyships.  

### 6️⃣ *Costs*  
KKL’s no-fee offer was *not decisive*. Harrison’s costs subject to *fixed regime or assessment*, ensuring transparency.

## 🧲 *Magnetic Factors*  
| *Factor* | *Description* | *Weight* |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| *Conflict risk* | KKL’s link to JNF UK (beneficiary) incompatible with deputy neutrality. | 🔴 *Decisive* |
| *Investigatory need* | Deputy must be free to probe fundraising breaches or consider a statutory will. | 🔴 *Decisive* |
| *Past wishes* | Historic trust with KKL exists but is compromised by structural conflict. | 🟠 *Moderate* |
| *Cost saving* | KKL’s no-fee offer helpful but outweighed by independence concerns. | 🟡 *Limited* |

---

## 🧾 *Judgment Outcome*  
- *KKL’s application dismissed.*  
- *Lynsey Harrison appointed* deputy for *property and affairs.*  
- *Costs:* Payable from OT’s estate under *Rule 19.2 CoP Rules 2017.*  
- *No departure* from the usual order sought.

## 🪞 *Polaris Reading — Structural Themes*  
- *Conflict as visibility test:* entanglement remains hidden until independence is imposed.  
- *Charity–trust hybrids:* pastoral care used as reputational cover.  
- *Cost as camouflage:* “Free” offers mask institutional interest.  
- *Best interests ≠ sentiment:* law privileges *independence and auditability* over relational continuity.
