# ❌ NCND Technique  
**First created:** 2025-10-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*A satirical take on the bureaucrat’s favourite safe word: “Neither Confirm Nor Deny.” A kink for opacity, whispered like a mantra whenever the truth gets too close.*  

---

## 📂 Scope  

This node treats **NCND** as a suppression manoeuvre, lampooning the absurd theatre of officialdom:  
whole agencies chanting “we can neither confirm nor deny” in unison, as if repetition itself were an argument.  
It highlights how NCND is less about security and more about *deniability as performance*.

## 🗝️ Key Points  

- **Legal Roots**  
  - Built into the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Data Protection Act (DPA).  
  - Allows a body to refuse to confirm whether data is held if even acknowledgement would prejudice national security, law enforcement, or crime prevention.  

- **Who Uses It**  
  - Police, MoJ, intelligence agencies (MI5, MI6, GCHQ).  
  - Increasingly copied by local councils, regulators, and quasi-public bodies when they want a “security-sounding” refusal.  

- **Purpose**  
  - Prevents tipping off suspects or revealing sensitive capabilities.  
  - In practice, used as a catch-all shield for reputational management and bureaucratic avoidance.  

- **Effect**  
  - Produces the same answer across multiple agencies, creating the impression of coordination or conspiracy.  
  - Leaves the requester with no confirmation and no denial — only a blank wall.  

- **Oversight**  
  - Can be challenged at the ICO (for SAR/FOI refusals).  
  - Tribunal can inspect the withheld information and decide whether NCND was justified.  
  - Rarely overturned unless blatantly misapplied.

It captures the choreography of opacity: a refusal dressed as neutrality, deployed whenever disclosure would be politically or institutionally inconvenient.
