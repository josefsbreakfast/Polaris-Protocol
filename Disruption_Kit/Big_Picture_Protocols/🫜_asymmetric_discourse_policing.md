# 🫜 Case Note: Asymmetric Discourse Policing  
**First created:** 2025-09-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-12  
*Forensic note on how criticism of some states is normalised, while others are conflated with identity-based attacks*

---

## Definition  
Asymmetric discourse policing occurs when criticism of some states is treated as routine political analysis, while criticism of others is flagged, filtered, or conflated with identity-based attacks.  

This creates uneven conditions for speech: some critiques are taken as normal, others are treated as dangerous or illegitimate.  

---

## Observed pattern  

- **UK / US / France (and similar states):**  
  - Criticism is treated as *ordinary politics*.  
  - No conflation with the national identity of citizens.  
  - Example: Criticising UK policy does not make one “anti-British people.”  

- **Israel (and sometimes China, Russia, others):**  
  - Criticism is treated as identity-adjacent or fraught.  
  - Conflation often occurs: Israel (state) = Jewish people (global); China (state) = Chinese diaspora, etc.  
  - Critics are accused of crossing into racism or bigotry even when speaking about *state behaviour*.  

---

## Impact  

- **Diaspora communities** (Jewish, Chinese, Russian, etc.) carry reputational burdens for the actions of states they may not identify with.  
- **Speech is chilled**: individuals self-censor to avoid being accused of bias or bigotry.  
- **Platform behaviour skews**: moderation tools apply unevenly, sandboxing certain topics or slowing their reach.  

---

## Polaris insight  

- The distinction between **state actors** and **peoples/identities** is often blurred deliberately — by governments themselves, by adversaries, and by platforms.  
- Asymmetric discourse policing creates **double standards** in critique: what is routine in one context is taboo in another.  
- Forensic clarity requires naming this asymmetry directly: *Israel can be critiqued as a state actor just like the UK can — but discourse infrastructures don’t treat it that way.*

*Case Note: Asymmetric Discourse Policing* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how speech infrastructures treat different states unevenly, flattening political critique into identity disputes.
