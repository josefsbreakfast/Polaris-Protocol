# 🫥 Over-Safety as Containment  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-07  
*How repeated reassurance, safety-checking, or clarifying statements can destabilise rather than protect.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Safety-scripts are meant to protect. But when repeated unnecessarily — especially in short timeframes — reassurance mutates into containment.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Repetition as implied correction.  
- Institutional “scolding tone.”  
- How safety language becomes suspicion.  
- Trauma-aligned communication analysis.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### **1. Reassurance Turns Into Warning When Repeated**  
If reassurance is repeated, the brain reads: “Something must be wrong.”

### **2. Survivors Recognise the Tone Immediately**  
Correction masked as care; monitoring masked as support.

### **3. Good Practice: Match the Person, Not the Script**  
Safety interventions must track the actual state of the speaker.
