*Why winding down carefully matters, and why abrupt endings scar memory.*

## 🛸 Appearance vs Reality  

- Outsiders may think you’re dragging things out or being “difficult.”  
- Inside, you’re managing **two loops**: the external interaction + the internal memory loop.  
- Aim: to end in a way the hippocampus stores cleanly, and the amygdala doesn’t tag as unresolved trauma.

## 🪢 The Wind-Down Logic  

- Humans often work through notice periods, hand over carefully, finish projects with care.  
- Last memories stick hardest. Ending with chaos taints the whole story. Ending with dignity integrates it.  
- Same applies to relationships, jobs, social ties.

## 🧠 The Encoding Imperative  

- Hippocampus encodes episodes. Amygdala tags emotion.  
- Abrupt hostile endings = scarred memory.  
- Deliberate endings = integrated memory.  
- Winding down is not weakness; it is mental health preservation.

## ⚖️ Choice and Cost  

- *No contact* is sometimes survival.  
- *Winding down* is sometimes necessary for long-term stability.  
- Each case demands informed choice. Exhausting, yes. But critical.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Memory Encoding Endings* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It frames endings not as weakness but as survivor strategy for healthy encoding.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
