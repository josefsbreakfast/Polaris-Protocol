## ✨ Summary  

A breakdown of how bureaucratic actors weaponise ethical language and institutional jargon to enforce compliance, mask inactivity, and redirect scrutiny.  

---

## 🗝️ Key Features  
- Manipulation rebranded as care.  
- Passive aggression disguised as procedural professionalism.  
- Bullshit passed off as strategic expertise.  

---

## 🛠 Core Tactics  
- **Buzzword saturation** — “engagement,” “resilience,” “framework.”  
- **Faux-compassionate redirection** — “we’re just concerned for your welfare.”  
- **Semantic decoys** — “that’s not within our remit.”  

---

## ⚠️ Observed Impact  
- Discourages challenge through performative civility.  
- Produces survivor fatigue and compliance.  
- Protects structural inaction behind a fog of “process.”  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Best Response  
- Call the bluff. Use sharper terms. Make the implicit violence explicit.  
- Keep your own glossary. Turn their language back against them.  
- Build public documents that expose the difference between action and appearance.
