# 💞 Ethics of Nudging vs Desire  
**First created:** 2025-09-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Contrasting Thaler/Sunstein’s liberal “choice architecture” with Fisher’s critique of desire under capitalism.*

## 📲 Nudge (2009)  
- Policy playbook for nudgers.  
- Liberal framing: assumes capitalism as neutral backdrop.  
- Audience: technocrats, consultants, behavioural architects.  
- Core ethic: how to shape behaviour without appearing coercive.  

---

## 📖 Post-Capitalist Desire (2017 lectures)  
- Fisher’s final teaching.  
- Uses *trieb* (drive/desire) as analytic hinge.  
- Argues capitalism captures and recycles desire.  
- Core ethic: how to think and act after recognising that capture.  

---

## 🐝 Ethical Hinge  
- *Nudge*: ethics of management — influence within capitalism.  
- *Fisher*: ethics of exposure — critique of how desire itself is managed.  
- Together: one writes for the managers, the other for the managed.  

---

## 🦀 Democracy Claim vs Containment Reality  
- In a liberal democracy, both should coexist in open debate.  
- In practice: *Nudge* subsidised into Whitehall decks, Fisher nudged out of visibility.  
- Containment logics redraw “middle ground” by suppressing critique.

*Ethics of Nudging vs Desire* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates the conceptual hinge — *nudge* vs *trieb* — as an ethical fault line in governance logics.
