# 🧠 HM Dept of Coercive Nudges  
**First created:** 2025-08-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-10  
*Polaris Protocol doctrine node — behavioural science repurposed as state containment.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

This node collects files documenting the use of **behavioural nudging** — the soft-power scripts of compliance.  

Where surveillance captures metadata and forks fracture voices, nudges operate at the affective layer:  
- Steering populations under the guise of *choice*  
- Framing coercion as *support*  
- Engineering obedience through subtle psychological levers

## 🗺️ Position in Polaris  

*Coercive Nudges* sits at the seam where **behavioural scripts** meet **systemic containment**.  
Though filed here, nodes like the *Heavy Bundle* cross-link to **Big Picture Protocols** because they track not only nudges but their embedding in justice, governance, and culture.  

> Nudges are not neutral. They are architectures of obedience disguised as care.

*HM Dept of Coercive Nudges* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how behavioural science is redeployed as a mechanism of governance, coercion, and suppression.
