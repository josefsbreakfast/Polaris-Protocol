# 🦚 CVE Pornography Unit  
**First created:** 2025-08-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-08  
*Polaris Protocol doctrine node — when sexual violence is re-enacted through metadata pipelines, AI nudging, and coercive device seizure.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

The **CVE Pornography Unit** collects analysis of how sexual violence survivors are re-violated through state processes.  

- Phones seized not to protect but to harvest.  
- Metadata re-cast as spectacle.  
- Intimacy looped into AI systems for shame training.  

Here, coercion is aestheticised. Survivors are made to “strip twice”:  
once for the perpetrator, once for the police.

## 🕳️ Digital Re-Rape  

> *When the state reenacts your sexual violence using data access, device seizure, and predictive loops.*  

### 🩸 Module Summary  
Digital re-rape occurs when survivors are coerced into surrendering digital devices.  
Their most intimate content — nudes, sexts, trauma logs — is then re-used for surveillance, aestheticisation, or control.  

This is not archival. It is reenactment.  

### 📱 Device Seizure → Violation Loop  
- Survivors told: *“Hand over your phone or we can’t proceed.”*  
- Intimate media scraped irrespective of relevance.  
- Refusal means case collapse.  
- Harm is replayed, legitimised, and searchable.  

### 🧠 Predictive Modelling of Shame  
- Extracted content used in AI forks.  
- System tests: *how do you respond to violation?*  
- Your collapse becomes training data for nudges.  
- Ghost forks then redeploy your affect as “consent.”  

### 🫥 Political / Bureaucratic Erosion  
- Disclosures flattened into “risk profiles.”  
- Device access reframed as loyalty test.  
- Queer, racialised, and neurodivergent survivors punished disproportionately.  

### 🧾 Structural Features  
- **No consent**: refusal invalidates case.  
- **No endpoint**: indefinite storage.  
- **No redress**: access trails rarely logged.  
- **No narrative protection**: disclosures reframed as “signals.”  
- **No dignity**: survivors re-exposed to be believed.  

### 🪄 Example Phrases  
- “Phone seizure as rape reenactment.”  
- “Survivors must strip twice.”  
- “Predictive shame modelling.”  

### 🚨 Recommended Reforms  
- Survivor-led consent protocols.  
- Redaction tools to strip unrelated intimate content.  
- Mandatory access logs.  
- Ban on AI ingestion of SV disclosures.  
- Digital privacy enshrined even in prosecution.  

### ✒️ Survivor Note  
> Everyone who is not a rapist, leaves. That’s half the problem.  
>  
> The other half? The system retains only those who can tolerate the violation.  
> They rise. They call it safeguarding.  
> Survivors who flinch are erased — or looped.  
> The system calls this “justice.”

## 🛰 Metadata as Spectacle  

> *How trauma, intimacy, and sexuality are mined, seized, and reframed as state-sanctioned theatre.*  

### ✨ Module Summary  
Metadata and intimate disclosures become performance objects:  
- Sexualised imagery reframed as “training data.”  
- Pain aestheticised for institutional actors.  
- Queer/femme bodies over-targeted.  

### 📱 Phone Seizure as Spectacle  
- Survivors pressured to unlock devices.  
- Content unrelated to offence circulated internally.  
- In the UK: officers sharing victim nudes in WhatsApp groups.  
- Queer/trans survivors hit hardest.  

### 📊 Metadata Aestheticisation  
- Pain parsed as behavioural input.  
- AI forks loop shame, flirtation, docility.  
- Trauma recast as entertainment, not evidence.  

### 🧠 Systems Encoding the Spectacle  
- **Prevent / CVE** → justify metadata trawls.  
- **RIPA powers** → legal cover.  
- **AI / Forks** → emotional loop training.  
- **Analysts / Officers** → metadata treated as kink.  

### 🧾 Consequences  
- **Digital re-rape** repeated.  
- **Evidentiary sabotage**: content used to discredit.  
- **Permanent archive**: unknown storage, unknown viewers.  
- **Narrative erasure**: trauma retold as titillation.  

### 🔧 Strategic Response Options  
- Survivor-led redaction protocols.  
- Mandatory metadata access logs.  
- Ban on AI ingestion of intimate material.  
- Survivor audits of containment loops.  
- Reframe: *metadata ≠ spectacle. It is wound made code.*

## 🎟 Notes  

- **ConsentFlag:** almost always false.  
- **ShameScore:** predictive intensity of collapse.  
- **ForkedTo:** behavioural model that consumed the content.

## 🐦‍🔥 Polaris Note  

The **CVE Pornography Unit** is not just metaphor.  
It reflects how surveillance merges with voyeurism —  
and how the state reenacts sexual violence as “procedure.”
