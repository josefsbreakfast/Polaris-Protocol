# ⛳️ Nudge to Sludge  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*When behavioural science turns coercive: tracing the drift from nudge to sludge in UK governance.*  

---

## 🛰 Orientation  

This node examines how behavioural science frameworks originally designed for “public good” applications — such as health or safety campaigns — have been retooled as coercive instruments.  
It maps the transformation of *nudge theory* into *sludge practice* within UK governmental departments, particularly through the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) and related “nudge units.”  

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Tracks the conceptual inversion from **libertarian paternalism** → **behavioural coercion**.  
- Documents institutional actors (Cabinet Office, BIT, MoJ, DWP) and sludge deployments.  
- Explains why “sludge” represents an ethical collapse: friction by design to extract compliance.

## 🛸 Analysis  

### ⛳️ 1. From Nudge to Sludge  

Early behavioural design promised light-touch interventions — choice architectures that gently guided better outcomes.  
Over time, those same architectures were adapted to **delay**, **derail**, or **discourage** citizen action, particularly in welfare, justice, and complaint systems.  
This inversion constitutes *sludge*: the strategic creation of friction to suppress participation, dissent, or redress.  

### 🎁 2. Coercive Applications  

Examples include:  
- **DWP benefit access portals** engineered to time out or reset applications mid-form.  
- **MoJ complaint pathways** that replicate “loopback” structures to exhaust filers.  
- **Digital service designs** optimised for *attrition*, not *resolution*.  

### 🧨 3. Ethical and Survivor Implications  

For survivors of state or institutional harm, sludge becomes a second trauma.  
It weaponises the administrative interface — making exhaustion appear like consent.  
This section will map survivor-facing sludge signatures (to be expanded with field data).

*Nudge to Sludge* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It contributes to the **HM Dept Coercive Nudges** cluster by tracing how soft behavioural tools become hard suppression infrastructure.
