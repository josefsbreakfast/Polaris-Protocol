# ⚖️ Over the Line — Behavioural Targeting and Elections  
**First created:** 2025-10-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-11  
*Where behavioural insight becomes electoral interference.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node clarifies what counts as legitimate behavioural targeting in UK elections — and when campaign practices cross the legal or ethical boundary.  
It translates statutes (PPERA 2000, Elections Act 2022, Data Protection Act 2018) into a practical field map: what’s “in play,” what’s “over the line,” and where the grey areas live.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- Shows how **behavioural insight** can become **manipulative engineering**.  
- Distinguishes **legal compliance** from **democratic integrity**.  
- Provides a “cricket-style” table of *within bounds / out of bounds* tactics.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Legal & Normative Baseline  
UK elections are regulated by:  
- **Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA)** — donations, spending, transparency.  
- **Elections Act 2022** — digital imprints, updated *undue influence* offences, intimidation sanctions.  
- **Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR** — lawful use of voter data.  
- **Representation of the People Acts** — bribery, treating, personation, and false statements.  

Together they prohibit coercion, deception, foreign funding, opaque micro-targeting and data misuse.

### 2. The Cricket Table — What’s Within Bounds vs Out of Bounds  

| 🏏 Play Type | **Within Bounds** | **Out of Bounds (Over the Line)** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Audience Targeting** | Demographic or geographic segmentation (age, region, interest) with public messaging. | Secret or “dark” micro-niches defined by inferred traits (e.g. anxiety, ethnicity, sexual history). |
| **Message Transparency** | Campaign imprint visible; content logged and reviewable. | Hidden source or impersonation; bots or anonymous ads with no imprint. |
| **Tone & Technique** | Persuasive but factual; emotional appeals that reflect party platform. | Deceptive, fear-based, or fabricated claims designed to suppress or polarise. |
| **Data Handling** | Lawful processing of volunteered or publicly available data. | Covert scraping, psychographic profiling, or purchasing data from unconsented brokers. |
| **Influence Mechanics** | Normal persuasion, canvassing, or GOTV efforts. | Intimidation, bribery, threats, “stay home” suppression, or spiritual coercion. |
| **Funding & Origin** | UK-registered spending, declared donations. | Foreign money, proxy donations, or coordinated offshore operations. |
| **AI / Automation** | Transparency about generative or automated content. | Deepfakes, synthetic voices, or bot networks disguised as real citizens. |
| **Platform Conduct** | Compliance with platform ad libraries and moderation. | Circumventing transparency tools or exploiting recommendation algorithms to conceal reach. |

### 3. Grey Zones & Enforcement Gaps  
- **Data micro-targeting:** still largely untested in UK courts.  
- **Emotional manipulation:** difficult to prove as “undue influence.”  
- **Platform opacity:** campaigners may rely on platform self-policing.  
- **AI content:** deepfake rules emerging, not yet standardised.  

Practical test: if a tactic is **opaque, coercive, deceptive, foreign-linked, or exploits cognitive vulnerability**, it’s probably *over the line* — even if not yet explicitly outlawed.
