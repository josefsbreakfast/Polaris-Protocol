# 🛰️ Forked Code + Ghost-Voice API Risks  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Threat brief on geotargeted “voice forks” and invisible decision trees.*  

---

## 👻 Problem statement
Public forks that bundle a ghost-voice API can self-select targets via region, handset class, and social graph. When coupled with silent decision-trees, they create de facto persuasion endpoints at population scale.

## 👾 Obvious (missing) controls
- Mandatory provenance headers on voice API calls (signed origin + model hash).  
- OS-level interstitials for first run of any “voice persona” with region gating.  
- Carrier-grade anomaly detection for voice-feature call bursts by postcode.  
- Platform policy: ban *opaque* behavioural trees in public SDKs.

## 👹 Red flags
- “Persona updates” without changelog or model hash.  
- Abnormal mic permission churn; novel TTS latency signatures.
