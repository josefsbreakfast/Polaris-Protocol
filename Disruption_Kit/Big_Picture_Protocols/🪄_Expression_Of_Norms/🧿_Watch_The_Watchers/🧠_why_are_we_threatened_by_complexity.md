*How “complexity” triggers escalation and bias.*

---

## ✨ Overview  

When individuals present as “complex,” “non-standard” or simply “highly intelligent,” systems built for rapid categorisation often flag them as manipulative, risky or non-compliant.  
This reflex drives escalation and “high value” labelling even where no wrongdoing exists.

---

## 📿 Patterns  

- **Intelligence gap:** staff feel out of their depth; escalate to specialists.  
- **Gendered and racialised bias:** women, minorities and non-conforming people more readily labelled “difficult” or “radicalised.”  
- **Selector effect:** once flagged as complex, future encounters are pre-framed by old notes.  
- **Cultural trope:** “foreigners are sneaky” or “intellectuals are manipulators” — a deep-seated stereotype in British security culture.

## 🌱 Impacts  

- Converts above-average intelligence or difference into a risk category.  
- Ensures the same small circle of analysts and contractors reappear on a person’s file.  
- Creates “forever files” and “frequent flyer” loops without a conscious decision to surveil for life.

🧠 🧿 🌀 📚 — This node sits at the junction where difference is misread as danger.  
It echoes Kafka’s *The Trial* and *The Castle*, where faceless systems grind down the “non-standard,” and films like *Minority Report* where prediction itself becomes pretext for escalation.  
Stories of brilliant but misread figures — Alan Turing in *The Imitation Game*, John Nash in *A Beautiful Mind* — show how intelligence can be framed as risk rather than asset.

*Why Are We Threatened by Complexity?* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how systems conflate complexity with threat, fuelling escalation loops.
