# ⚖️ Containment as Threshold Crime  
**First created:** 2025-10-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*On when administrative containment passes from governance to atrocity.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines how administrative containment — justified through welfare, border, or counter-terror frameworks — can cross into the terrain of **crimes against humanity** or **genocide**, even when no actor ever speaks those words aloud.  
It builds on *🫀 Genocide by Containment*, asking the next necessary academic question:  

> *Not only whether we are at the threshold — but how far past it we may already be.*

## 📚 Legal and Conceptual Frameworks  

The **Rome Statute (1998)** defines *crimes against humanity* as widespread or systematic attacks against civilian populations, including *persecution* and *other inhumane acts intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury*.  
The **UN Genocide Convention (1948)** extends this to acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.  

Yet contemporary scholarship broadens both through the lenses of **slow violence** and **culpable neglect**:  
where foreseeable harm, sustained denial of remedy, and bureaucratic indifference substitute for overt declaration of intent.  
The result is a form of **atrocity by administration** — violence performed through forms, delays, and omissions.

## 🩸 Threshold Indicators  

Containment becomes a threshold crime when:  

1. **Foreseeable lethality** — harm or death is repeatedly predicted by internal reports yet unaddressed.  
2. **Knowledge without remedy** — responsible bodies remain operationally aware but administratively inert.  
3. **Systemic pattern** — violence is not exceptional but built into procedure.  
4. **Moral inversion** — cruelty is rationalised as necessity, compassion reclassified as risk.  
5. **Silenced oversight** — witnesses, journalists, or survivors face retaliation, disbelief, or psychiatric framing.  

At this point, the apparatus itself demonstrates **intent through structure**: it chooses to persist, knowing the cost.

---

## 🕯 Case Application  

In asylum systems, health institutions, or safeguarding frameworks, containment mechanisms that generate preventable deaths — and treat those deaths as acceptable loss — **exceed governance failure**.  
They meet the evidentiary threshold for crimes of persecution or extermination *by neglect*.  
Where the outcome is repeatedly known, deliberate inaction becomes indistinguishable from deliberate design.

---

## 🎓 Academic Questioning  

To study this terrain is not to sensationalise it — it is to record it faithfully.  
Every genocide archive begins with evidence that was once “not yet proven.”  

> *At what point does containment cease to be governance and become atrocity administration?*  
> *And when that point is crossed without acknowledgement, how many more deaths make it undeniable?*

The purpose of this inquiry is not rhetorical.  
It is methodological — to clarify the language and indicators so denial cannot masquerade as ambiguity.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Containment as Threshold Crime* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It formalises the question of when bureaucratic harm crosses from governance failure into atrocity administration, using international law and survivor-led ethics as dual compasses.
