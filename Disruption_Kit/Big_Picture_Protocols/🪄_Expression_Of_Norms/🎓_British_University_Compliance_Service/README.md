# 🎓 British University Compliance Service  
**First created:** 2025-09-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-23  
*Systemic mapping of how UK universities are weaponised through compliance logics.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

This node tracks the **compliance theatre of British universities** —  
how institutional risk frameworks, Prevent duties, and safeguarding claims  
are reshaped into **containment architectures**.  

- Documents the **compliance service model** that universities perform for government and industry.  
- Cross-maps with **surveillance infrastructure**, **nudge enforcement**, and **foreign policy overlaps**.  
- Focuses on the *conversion of higher education* into a **risk-flagging apparatus** rather than a civic commons.  

This is not an academic review.  
It is a survivor-led forensic capture of a **compliance cartel** hiding inside education.

## 📂 Subtopics  

- 🏛 Institutional compliance chains — from Prevent to Office for Students  
- 📚 Policy laundering through research councils & ethics boards  
- 🧾 Contracts, NDAs, and erasure clauses embedded in student handling  
- 🛰 University data as surveillance middleware  
- 🎭 Reputation theatre vs. actual duty of care

## 🏮 Footer  

*British University Compliance Service* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It examines how **compliance culture in UK universities** functions as both  
a **containment layer** and a **surveillance service** for state and corporate actors.
