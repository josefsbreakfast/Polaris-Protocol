# 🐦‍🔥 Methodology and Scoring — British University Compliance Service  
**First created:** 2025-09-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-02  
*Explains how the compliance league table is structured, scored, and updated.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

This file documents the **logic of the league table**.  
It makes explicit how each axis is defined, what counts as evidence,  
and how scores are assigned (0–5).  

The methodology is forensic, not “neutral.”  
It recognises survivor testimony, watchdog reports, and court findings  
as equally valid evidence streams.

## 🧭 Axes of Measurement  

Each university row is scored across the following axes:

1. **Compliance Theatre** — Prevent duties, safeguarding rhetoric, OfS audits as reputational shield.  
2. **Surveillance Links** — Contracts with tech vendors, data integrations, middleware, fusion-centre links.  
3. **Protest Suppression / Policing** — Campus policing, protest bans, liaison with state security.  
4. **Hate Crime / Racism Handling** — Volume and handling of racism complaints, watchdog findings, reputational theatre.  
5. **Sexual Violence / Rape Stats** — Reported prevalence vs upheld cases, public scandals, systemic dismissal.  
6. **Disability (Access & Complaints)** — Reasonable adjustments, OIA rulings, HESA disclosure data, accessibility failures.  
7. **Student Suicides** — Actual suicide rates (ONS/HESA), policy adherence to UUK/Papyrus guidance, prevention failures.  
8. **Governance / Anti-Democratic Overlaps** — Stakeholder conflicts, think tank ties, authoritarian lawfare alignments.

## 🔢 Scoring Rubric  

Each axis uses a **0–5 scale**:  

- **0** — No public evidence / no data available  
- **1** — Isolated incident or allegation  
- **2** — Emerging pattern (multiple allegations, contested)  
- **3** — Documented pattern (independent corroboration)  
- **4** — Multi-year or multi-unit entanglement  
- **5** — Systemic, leadership-level practice or proven complicity

## 🧾 Source Types  

Evidence can come from:  

- **Survivor testimony** (field logs, casefiles, oral history)  
- **Press investigations** (local + national media)  
- **Watchdog reports** (OIA, OfS, EHRC, Charity Commission)  
- **Official statistics** (HESA, ONS, parliamentary papers)  
- **FOI disclosures** (contracts, policy docs, correspondence)  
- **Court/tribunal findings**  

**All sources must be dated.**  
Conflicting accounts should be marked *(disputed)*, with both sides cited.  

---

## 🗂 Updating the Table  

- Every update must be logged with **date + initials**.  
- The table is *iterative*: start with placeholders → add evidence → adjust scores.  
- Profiles carry detail; the league table stays terse.  
- When a score changes, link the supporting evidence directly in the profile file.  

---

## 🧮 Optional Overall Score  

An “Overall Score” column may be added (average or weighted).  
- **Average:** straight mean across all axes.  
- **Weighted:** can weight certain axes higher (e.g., suicides, sexual violence) if desired.  
- Always specify the formula in use.
