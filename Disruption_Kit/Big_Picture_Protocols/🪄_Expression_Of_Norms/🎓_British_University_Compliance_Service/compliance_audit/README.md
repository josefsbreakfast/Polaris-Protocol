# 🎓 British University Compliance Service — Compliance Audit  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Internal audit framework for assessing surveillance-adjacent compliance structures in UK higher education.*

---

## Purpose
To map how university “compliance” units have evolved from risk-management departments into hybrid enforcement systems.  
These units often act as soft policing infrastructure: monitoring academic speech, digital behaviour, and student activism under the guise of safety, duty of care, or counter-extremism.

This audit template helps investigators, journalists, or academic unions trace where governance has drifted from safeguarding to suppression.

---

## Audit Focus Areas
1. **Policy Layer** – Examine Prevent compliance statements, social media policies, and data retention schedules.  
2. **Infrastructure Layer** – Identify API integrations with attendance, finance, or behaviour-tracking software.  
3. **Personnel Layer** – Track staff with dual appointments (compliance + security, compliance + comms).  
4. **Data Layer** – Review access rights, audit logs, and consent trails in VLEs, CRM, and HR systems.  
5. **Narrative Layer** – Capture language shifts: “student welfare” → “reputational risk”; “academic freedom” → “harm mitigation”.

## Sample Indicators of Drift
| Indicator | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Risk Taxonomies** | Lists of “sensitive topics” that overlap with legitimate research fields. |
| **Automated Flags** | Attendance, email, or LMS data repurposed for behavioural monitoring. |
| **External Interfaces** | Quiet partnerships with law enforcement or data brokers. |
| **Non-Disclosure** | Staff bound by opaque “information governance” NDAs. |

## Recommended Actions
- Publish annual *Academic Freedom Impact Assessment*.  
- Require external data-protection audits of Prevent-linked systems.  
- Create opt-out registry for automated risk profiling.  
- Build a staff-student oversight committee with statutory power to review compliance algorithms.
