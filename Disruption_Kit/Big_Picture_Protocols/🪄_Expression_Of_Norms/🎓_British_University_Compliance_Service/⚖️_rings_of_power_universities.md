**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  
*How universities are tempted with containment bargains: sovereignty traded for the illusion of stability.*

## 🛰️ The Offer  
- Suppress student protest.  
- Smooth over staff unrest and strikes.  
- Bury safeguarding scandals.  
- Promise: *“We’ll fix it, we’ll protect you. All you have to do is let us handle it.”*

## 🐝 Pattern  
- Institutions take the “Ring” because it offers exactly what leadership wants: control, insulation, prestige.  
- Each thinks they hold unique authority, but in reality they are bound into a **suppression industry**.  
- Not a single source, but a **market of fixers** supplying containment.
