# 🛰️ Financial Attrition as Suppression

*Not all censorship shouts. Some just starve the signal.*

## 🧾 Concept  

Censorship doesn't always come as a ban.  
It comes as **non-renewed contracts**, **ownership takeovers**, and **invisible funding walls**.  

This node tracks **financial attrition** as a suppression strategy:  
- The newsroom collapses after the anchor refuses a political loyalty clause.  
- The artist loses distribution when a parent company pivots.  
- A platform throttles access unless the speaker self-neutralises.

It is quiet, systemic, deniable — and devastating.

## 🧯 Examples  

- *While We Watched* — Ravish Kumar pushed out via institutional neglect  
- *Boycott (2022)* — free speech silenced through anti-BDS economic contracts  
- NDTV — ownership transfer after prolonged government pressure  
- School authors — quietly dropped from curricula with no explanation  
- NGO and research grants — withheld after “undesirable” findings
