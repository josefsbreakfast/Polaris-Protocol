**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-08  
*How crisis exposed the gap between performative progressivism and actual left values.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The political shocks of 2020–2023 revealed a structural divide:  
**the performative left** — people fluent in progressive language but unwilling to incur cost — vs the actual left.

This node maps how crisis exposed that gap.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Distinction between real ideology vs progressive cosplay  
- Why performativity collapses under pressure  
- Purity politics as crisis-response  
- Structural impact on movements and solidarity

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. What the Performative Left Is  
Traits:
- equality as aesthetic  
- solidarity until inconvenient  
- discourse > action  
- personal brand > collective risk  
- collapses when stakes rise  

These actors are not left-wing; they are *centre-right with progressive language skills*.

### 2. Crisis as Sorting Mechanism  
Mass death, economic collapse, and civil unrest revealed:
- who stands firm  
- who vanishes  
- who protects  
- who retreats to comfort  

### 3. Why This Destabilises Movements  
The performative left:
- dilutes clarity  
- drains capacity  
- generates internal conflict  
- encourages semantic policing  
- resists structural change  
- abandons marginalised groups  
- fractures coalitions  

### 4. Purity Politics  
Post-pandemic environments produce purification reflexes.  
On the left, this manifests as:
- linguistic purism  
- exclusion  
- moral absolutism  
- circular firing squads  

Some justified, some just human stress.
