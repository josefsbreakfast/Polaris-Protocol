# 🧬 Cambridge Analytica Genealogy  
**First created:** 2025-09-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Tracing the persistence of data-driven psychological manipulation from Cambridge Analytica to its modern successors across media, politics, and crisis management.*

---

## 🧩 Overview  

Cambridge Analytica (CA) is often treated as a closed scandal, a single data-harvesting event that ended with a ban.  
In reality, CA was a **prototype organism** — a behavioural-engineering company that mutated, split, and re-emerged through shell firms, consultancy networks, and think-tank ecosystems.  

Its genealogy forms a map of how *psychographic warfare* entered civilian governance.  
The same personnel and investors later surfaced in digital campaigning, crisis communications, and donor-driven “narrative management” projects that normalised manipulation as analytics.

## 🧮 Lineage Map  

1. **SCL → CA Core**  
   - **Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL Group)** supplied the military psy-ops framework.  
   - CA was its electoral front: data mining, psychological segmentation, and “behavioural micro-targeting.”  

2. **Post-Collapse Rebrands (2018 →)**  
   - **Emerdata Ltd** absorbed CA assets and executives.  
   - Former staff resurfaced in **Auspex International**, **AggregateIQ**, **Clear AI**, and **Croud Control** — new names, same datasets.  

3. **Think-Tank Bridges**  
   - Data-driven persuasion migrated into “policy research.”  
   - **Policy Exchange**, **Legatum Institute**, and similar bodies re-framed behavioural analytics as “public sentiment mapping.”  

4. **Contractor Symbiosis**  
   - Crisis-response and PR contractors adopt CA logic for *reputation management* and *content steering.*  
   - Donor networks fund parallel media outlets to amplify aligned narratives.  

5. **Algorithmic Evangelists**  
   - Academic partners and civic-tech foundations sanitise the language:  
     “evidence-based engagement,” “strategic communications,” “audience insight.”  
   - The method survives under ethical varnish.

## 🧭 Mechanisms of Persistence  

- **Data Re-Use:** identical voter-psychology clusters resurface in new datasets.  
- **Personnel Drift:** staff move laterally between political tech, philanthropy, and digital comms.  
- **Infrastructure Recycling:** analytics tools ported from election ops to “public-health” and “counter-extremism” campaigns.  
- **Donor Entanglement:** hedge-fund and energy-sector donors finance both media arms and influence software.  

Each cycle launders the same behavioural code through a new moral frame — democracy, safety, innovation, philanthropy — but the targeting logic remains unchanged.

## 🧰 Counter-Responses  

- **Expose Lineage Chains:** maintain open genealogies of staff, investors, and contracts post-CA.  
- **Demand Algorithmic Transparency:** require disclosure of behavioural-segmentation logic in public-sector communications.  
- **Audit Philanthro-Tech:** follow grants that merge “research” with voter-profiling analytics.  
- **Reclaim Data Dignity:** re-centre consent, purpose limitation, and survivor agency in data governance.
