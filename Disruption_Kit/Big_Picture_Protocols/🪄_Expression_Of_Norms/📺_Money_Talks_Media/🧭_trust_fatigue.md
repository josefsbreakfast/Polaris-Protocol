# 🧭 Trust Fatigue — How Late-Stage Media Erodes Civic Attention  
**First created:** 2025-10-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*When vigilance becomes exhaustion.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores the social-psychological exhaustion that follows constant exposure to crisis, outrage, and contradiction in digital media.  
Trust fatigue is not disbelief; it’s depletion — the nervous system protecting itself from information overload by withdrawing attention.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Information saturation:** more facts, less meaning.  
- **Outrage fatigue:** emotional hyper-stimulation → civic burnout.  
- **Algorithmic spirals:** engagement loops mistake distress for interest.  
- **Collapse of attention:** verification feels pointless.  
- **Civic cost:** apathy masquerades as neutrality.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1️⃣ The Cognitive Economy of Doubt  
Critical thinking requires energy; disbelief is cheap.  
As feeds fill with contradictory stories, people default to self-protection by opting out.  
The result is not ignorance but selective numbness — a managed refusal to care.  

---

### 2️⃣ From Alertness to Anomie  
During crises (COVID, elections, wars) audiences swing between hyper-vigilance and despair.  
When every notification feels urgent, none are.  
The attention economy mistakes this shutdown for boredom; it’s actually self-defence.  

---

### 3️⃣ The Role of Algorithmic Care  
Platforms interpret any pause as interest.  
A moment of horror becomes a training signal to serve more of the same.  
Outrage is thus curated as comfort food: familiar, corrosive, inescapable.  

---

### 4️⃣ Trust and the Local Press  
Local news was once the trust recovery mechanism of democracy — small, familiar, slow.  
Clone and template media have hijacked that register.  
The result: a nation of readers who still want to believe something but no longer know what.  

---

### 5️⃣ Counter-Moves  
- Design platforms to reward *verified silence*: acknowledge when no update is news.  
- Encourage slow news and community briefings over constant feeds.  
- Re-teach that “taking a break” is not ignorance but information hygiene.  
- Frame attention as a civic resource — finite, shared, worth guarding.
