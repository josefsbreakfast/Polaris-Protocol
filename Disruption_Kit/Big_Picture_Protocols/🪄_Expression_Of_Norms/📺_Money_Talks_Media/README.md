*Where donor cash, political contractors, and broadcast ecosystems fuse into narrative manipulation.*

---

## 🌐 Scope  
This cluster documents the **pipelines of money and influence** that shape media, think tanks, and political messaging.  
It focuses on how donor networks and data-driven contractors **buy narrative power**, laundering ideology into policy and broadcast discourse.  

Nodes here track:  
- **Donor ecosystems** that bankroll culture wars.  
- **Contractor firms** (e.g. Cambridge Analytica, Emerdata) and their successors.  
- **Think-tank pipelines** that legitimise imported ideology.  
- **Media manipulation** through bought reach, dark ads, and manufactured crisis theatre.

*Money Talks Media* is a living cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates donor pipelines and bought media ecosystems as core infrastructure of containment and manipulation.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
