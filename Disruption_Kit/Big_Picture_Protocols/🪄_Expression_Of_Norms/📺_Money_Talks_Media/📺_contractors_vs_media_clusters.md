# 📺 Contractors vs Media Clusters  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-28  
*Distinguishing the containment industry from donor-driven media empires — and showing where they converge*  

---

## Core Idea  
- Outsourcing contractors (Serco, Clearsprings, Mears, G4S, Capita) are **industrial actors**.  
- Hedge-fund donors (Marshall, Legatum) and legacy media (Murdoch, Rothermere) are **narrative actors**.  
- They don’t share ownership — but they converge in **politics, Parliament, and policy cycles**.  

---

## The Two Clusters  

### Contractor-Industrial Complex  
- Profits from backlog, hotels, detention.  
- Revenue from contracts, not clicks.  
- Needs public perception of crisis to sustain demand.  

### Media-Donor Complex  
- Profits from outrage, clicks, and political influence.  
- Funded by hedge funds, offshore wealth, family dynasties.  
- Needs constant crises to mobilise audiences.  

---

## Convergence Points  
- **Parliament:** MPs cite think-tank reports (*Policy Exchange*), amplified by tabloids, feeding contract renewals.  
- **Procurement:** Sensational coverage justifies new Home Office budgets → flows to contractors.  
- **Donor circuits:** Many of the same billionaires bankroll both political campaigns and think-tank/media outlets.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Contractors vs Media Clusters* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It shows how industry actors and donor-media actors operate separately but converge politically to sustain containment.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
