# 🙀 Chronically Online  
**First created:** 2025-10-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-28  
*Exploring how internet culture becomes normalised — a mode of being, a memetic economy, and a governance layer of norms.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
“Online” is no longer a location; it is an ontology.  
This cluster examines how digital life becomes *life itself* — how platforms, memes, and algorithmic habits shape behaviour, social belonging, and systems of control.  
The chronically online subject is both product and participant: performing identity through platforms that script visibility, attention, and belief.  

---

## ✨ Key Sections  
1. **Definition & Genealogy** — tracing the evolution of “online” as cultural condition, from early message boards to total platformisation.  
2. **Phenomenology of Being Online** — exploring how constant connectivity alters perception, affect, and selfhood.  
3. **Memetic Norms & Platform Labour** — mapping how trends, humour, and “relatability” become unpaid governance work.  
4. **Boundary Collapse** — analysing the erosion of distinction between public/private, work/leisure, self/brand.  
5. **Governance & Resistance** — examining how platform moderation, virality, and refusal shape civic and psychological space.
