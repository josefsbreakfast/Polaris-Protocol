# 📚 Muted Book Investigation  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-27  
*Replicable protocol for checking whether a trade title has been published and then effectively muted (plausible-deniability suppression vs natural obscurity).*  

---

## ✨ Introduction  
Not every book disappears because of poor sales. Some are quietly buried: denied reviews, paperback conversions, or library uptake, their circulation throttled by metadata errors or invisible hands.  

This protocol offers a **forensic baseline**: a way to distinguish between natural obscurity and engineered muting. It is designed for survivors, researchers, and creatives who suspect that disappearance is not an accident but an act of containment.  

---

## 🔍 1) Quick framing — what you’re testing  
You’re testing whether a legitimately published book was **deliberately denied normal circulation/visibility** (reviews, paperback conversion, library uptake, search discoverability) or whether it simply failed organically (poor marketing, low demand).  

Key observable markers to collect: publication metadata, retailer footprints, library holdings, review coverage, distribution metadata, Wayback/Archive history, and any contemporaneous correspondence (emails, letters) that might have chilled promotion.  

---

## 💾 2) Preserve first (non-negotiable)  
Before you share anything publicly or with journalists/counsel: preserve originals.  

- Save original emails as **.eml** (raw headers).  
- Save any legal threats as PDFs.  
- Take screenshots (publisher page, retailer listings, reviews). Record timestamps.  
- Archive pages on Wayback/Archive.org.  
- Make SHA256 checksums for key files. Keep an offline encrypted copy.  
- Don’t publicise raw private messages; use redacted extracts if sharing.  

---

## 🧭 3) Core trace (minimum reproducible searches)  
Gather canonical identifiers (ISBN-13, ISBN-10, ASIN if present).  

Search in parallel:  
1. **Publisher** — canonical page, press kit.  
2. **Retailers** — Amazon, Waterstones, Bookshop.org, B&N, Booktopia, Bol, Adlibris.  
3. **Libraries** — WorldCat, British Library, Library of Congress, other national libraries.  
4. **Google Books** — bibliographic entry/preview.  
5. **Distributors/metadata** — Ingram, Gardners, Nielsen, ISBN registries.  
6. **Reviews/media** — Guardian, FT, TLS, LRB, Spectator, trade outlets.  
7. **Social/reader** — Goodreads, LibraryThing, Amazon reviews.  
8. **Archive** — Wayback snapshots of publisher/retailer pages.  
9. **Search queries** — subject- vs title-specific discoverability.

## 📊 4) Concrete checks & what they indicate  
- **Publisher page stable** → book exists.  
- **Format patterns:** HB only, no PB after 12–18 months → suspicious for political trade titles.  
- **Ebook present, print dead** → “published” but choked distribution.  
- **Amazon rank** extremely low (>500k–1M) → negligible sales.  
- **WorldCat < 10 holdings** → poor library uptake, suspicious if topical.  
- **No mainstream UK reviews** → anomalous.  
- **Metadata errors** → discoverability sabotage or accident.  
- **Wayback deletions/relistings** → strong indicator of interference.  
- **Search results burying** → SEO suppression or manipulation.  

---

## 📝 5) Scoring: suspicion checklist  
Give 1 point for each:  
- HB only after 12–18 months  
- WorldCat < 10 holdings  
- BL reference-only  
- No mainstream reviews  
- Amazon rank > 500k  
- Distributor metadata missing/mistagged  
- Wayback removal/relist (2 points)  
- Search burying  

**Interpretation**  
- 0–1 → natural obscurity.  
- 2–3 → borderline.  
- 4–6 → probable engineered muting/systemic failure.  
- 7–9 → strong indicator of deliberate muting.  

---

## 🔬 6) Deeper forensic steps (if score ≥2)  
A. Audit WorldCat holdings.  
B. Pull distributor metadata.  
C. Archive history timeline.  
D. ARC/review timeline.  
E. Note publicity contacts, reviewer silence.  
F. Check ISBN registrations.  
G. Preserve email headers.  
H. Search takedown/complaint databases.  

---

## 📑 7) Templates (redacted-ready) 

### A — Neutral inquiry to publisher

`Subject: Query re: [REDACTED title] (ISBN: [REDACTED])...`

### B — Legal intake summary (for solicitor)

`Case title: [REDACTED] – potential publication muting...`

### C — Journalist packet (redacted)  
- One-page summary  
- Screenshots  
- WorldCat CSV  
- Review timeline  
- Suspicion score  
- Originals held back, sharable under NDA  

---

## 📢 8) Public presentation (safe practices)  
- Use redacted identifiers in public notes.  
- Publish methodology + public evidence, not raw private data.  
- Share originals only under NDA with journalists/solicitors.  
- Avoid naming unverified actors; focus on pattern + evidence.

## ✅ 9) Quick checklist for field investigators  
- [ ] Save .eml + headers  
- [ ] Screenshot publisher + Amazon  
- [ ] Archive on Wayback  
- [ ] Record WorldCat holdings  
- [ ] Search mainstream reviews  
- [ ] Pull distributor metadata  
- [ ] Compile review timeline  
- [ ] Compute suspicion score  
- [ ] Draft neutral inquiry  
- [ ] If score ≥4, package journalist + legal bundle

## ⚠️ 10) Interpretation & pitfalls  
- Not every low-visibility title is suppressed — small press = low reach.  
- Middleman cascades can mimic coordination.  
- Timing matters (delayed reviews or paperback).  
- Keep methodology forensic, not rhetorical.  

---

## ⏳ 11) Closing notes — limits  
This protocol diagnoses *what happened* (publication + visibility).  
It does not alone establish *motive or beneficiary*. That requires power-mapping.  
Sometimes suppression stems from trivial or spurious triggers that cascade.  

Treat this protocol as a **forensic baseline**.

## 🌌 Constellations  

📚 🔍 📝 ⚠️ — This node belongs to the forensic diagnostics constellation, mapping suppression at the level of bibliographic traces and visibility shifts.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *Fahrenheit 451* (Ray Bradbury) — erasure through invisibility.  
- *The Book of Laughter and Forgetting* (Milan Kundera) — histories vanish through silence.  
- *The Trial* (Franz Kafka) — bureaucratic disappearance as punishment.  

**Extended constellation (legal/technical):**  
- UK Defamation Act 2013 — hostile reviews and suppression crossover.  
- Metadata standards (Nielsen, ISBN registries) — choke points in discoverability.  
- Case law on takedowns and visibility suppression (e.g. *Google Spain v AEPD*, 2014).
