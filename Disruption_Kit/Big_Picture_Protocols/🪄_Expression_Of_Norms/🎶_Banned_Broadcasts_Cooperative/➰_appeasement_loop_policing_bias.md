# ➰ Appeasement Loop Policing Bias  
**First created:** 2025-09-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Why leftist groups are over-policed while fascists slide through with appeasement.*  

---

## ✨ Summary  
Policing bias in liberal states runs on a loop: the left is criminalised early, while the far right is appeased until its violence becomes undeniable. This asymmetry is not an accident but a governing strategy, preserving legitimacy optics by crushing resistance on one side and tolerating hierarchy on the other.  

---

## ⚖️ 1. Unequal Policing in Practice  
- **Leftist protest.** Squatters, climate activists, anti-racists: raided, kettled, pre-emptively criminalised. “Go floppy” tactics still end in mass arrests.  
- **Far-right protest.** Glassings, machetes, firearms: often treated with kid gloves. Police frame them as “public order challenges,” not existential threats.  
- **Prevent strategy.** Over-targets Muslim, left, and marginal protest movements; under-targets violent white extremism until denial is impossible.  

---

## 🌋 2. The Liberal Mistake  
Liberals often believe that fascists can be managed, bargained with, or “appeased.” This creates an **appeasement loop**:  

1. Fascist emerges.  
2. Liberals insist: “they’re manageable.”  
3. Enable or appease extremist.  
4. Extremism escalates.  
5. Liberal shock: “we never liked him.”  
6. Historical rewrite: “we fought for freedom.”

## 🪼 3. Contemporary Parallels  
- **Netanyahu.** Western governments used him as a bulldog for decades, enabling settlements and brutality. Now that his extremism is undeniable, they perform shock. Same playbook as post-1945 Britain: “we fought fascism,” while ignoring appeasement and embedded antisemitism.  
- **UK far right.** Groups tolerated until too violent to ignore; then reframed as aberrations, never as products of state leniency.  

---

## 🥭 4. Containment Logic  
- **Left = early criminalisation.** Because left protest threatens legitimacy optics (exposes hypocrisy, reveals fragility of state narratives).  
- **Right = delayed response.** Because far-right violence affirms hierarchy and racial order; it is tolerated until it becomes embarrassing.  
- **Appeasement as governance.** The loop is not failure but a deliberate strategy: by appeasing the right and crushing the left, legitimacy appears centred and “reasonable.”

## 🧿 5. The Alt-Right Myth of “Over-Policing”  
The far-right often insists there is a **two-tier system** in which white people are policed more harshly.  
This is an inversion of language — a rhetorical trick.  

The myth reframes class-based policing of poor white communities as racial discrimination against whiteness itself. It erases the fact that policing follows poverty and visible dissent, not simply identity.  

---

## 🐐 6. The Real Two-Tier System  
Yes, there is a two-tier system — but not in the way the alt-right tells the story.  

- **Class first.** Poor white communities are policed in ways that mirror the treatment of poor Black and brown communities, because poverty makes protest and survival tactics visible.  
- **Elites shielded.** White elites, meanwhile, rarely face kettling or raids. Their “containment” is reputational, not physical.  
- **Behaviour policed, not opinion.** What gets punished is not belief but expression. Poor people’s anger becomes criminalised protest; elite lobbying is treated as legitimate speech.  

The actual two-tier divide sustains appeasement: the poor are punished for expression, while the powerful are indulged — until their violence becomes too embarrassing to ignore.  

You are not policed more *because you are white*, but rather, _**because you are deemed lower social class**_.  

If someone tells you it is because you are white *only*, they are misleading you, whether they mean to or not.  

It is common in our country's history to mislead the people who are deemed *"less than"*, and to encourage us to be angry at each other.  
This makes us easier to control *en masse*.  

**Upholding racism prevents us bringing our energy to advocate for real change for us all.**  

Our racism, as white and white-passing people, prevents us from forming community and, ultimately being in solidarity with, the people we are racist towards. Just as the majority of men are actively disadvantaged by upholding patriarchy on behalf of elite men, the majority of white people are disadvantaged by upholding white supremacy for elite white people.  
Being able to lash out at other humans, as a way to stop mobilising and organising to advance social conditions, is to maintain micro-supremacy at the cost of macro-liberation.  
Whilst some people will ultimately choose this situation as long as they feel "in control" in their own lives, the majority will reject the systems of governance needed to uphold this, when aware and informed enough to make a free choice.  

That's not communism. That is an underlying principle of being a liberal democracy, post-Enlightenment.  

*Anyone who is trying to sell you a scapegoat is hoping you buy one.*

- *Things Fall Apart* (Chinua Achebe) — colonial legitimacy and double standards of control.  
- *The Reluctant Fundamentalist* (Mohsin Hamid) — misapplied suspicion and unequal policing after 9/11.  

**Extended constellation (legal/historical):**  
- UK “Public Order Acts” — differential policing of protests.  
- *Operation Swamp 81* — stop-and-search bias as systemic loop.  
- Case law: *R v Howell* (1982) — “breach of the peace” powers framing protest as threat.

*➰ Appeasement Loop Policing Bias* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how liberal states appease far-right extremism while over-policing leftist resistance, using denial and historical revision as cover.
