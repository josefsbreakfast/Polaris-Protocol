# 📡 Who Gets to Transmit

*Constellation thesis: containment is never about safety, it is about legitimacy.*

## ✨ Introduction  
Every struggle over media — from pirate FM to banned books, from survivor testimony to algorithmic feeds — is really a struggle over **who gets to transmit**.  

Containment is never neutral. It does not target what is *most dangerous*. It clamps down on what is *least tolerable to legitimacy*.

## 📻 Thesis  

- **Black and working-class sound cultures** → hyper-policed, raided, criminalised.  
- **White extremist sound cultures** → tolerated, discoverable, often under-policed.  
- **DIY manuals** → banned as dangerous when in leftist hands.  
- **Weapons stockpiles** → dismissed as “boys with toys” until lethal.  
- **Survivor testimony** → misattributed and smeared.  
- **Corporate media feeds** → flooded with distraction instead of silence.  

Across time and geography, the same pattern holds: suppression is not proportional to harm. It is proportional to the threat a signal poses to existing hierarchies.

## 🧭 Framing  
This constellation gathers nodes across outlaw sound, banned texts, appeasement bias, and testimony suppression. Each is an instance of the same logic:  

- **Not safety.** Pirate FM never downed a plane. DIY manuals never toppled governments.  
- **Legitimacy.** What states cannot tolerate is unauthorised publics, independent knowledge, autonomous speech.  

From Brixton sofa parties to Congress Radio, from algorithmic pastel floods to WWII appeasement mythologies:  
*the question is always who is allowed to transmit, and who must be silenced.*

## 🏮 Footer  
*📡 Who Gets to Transmit* is a constellation node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It anchors the **Banned Broadcasts Cooperative**, mapping how states and corporations criminalise, ban, or flood transmissions that challenge their legitimacy.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
