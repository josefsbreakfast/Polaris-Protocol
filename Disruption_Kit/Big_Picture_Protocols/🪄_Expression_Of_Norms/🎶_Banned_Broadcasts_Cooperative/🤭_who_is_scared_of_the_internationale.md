## Case Note: *The Internationale* — Transmission, Suppression, and Emotive Coordination

**Purpose:**  
This note documents how *The Internationale* functions as a historically durable, emotive coordination signal, why it is disproportionately vulnerable to deplatforming, and how algorithmic curation shapes which versions remain legible to contemporary audiences.

This is not an argument for or against the song’s politics.  
It is an analysis of **how and why certain cultural signals are suppressed, distorted, or quarantined**.

## 1. Why *The Internationale* Belongs Here

*The Internationale* is one of the most widely translated songs in human history.  
It is also one of the most persistently **deplatformed, reframed, or contextually isolated**.

Notably:
- recordings are often removed, muted, or made hard to find  
- surviving versions skew toward highly stylised, overtly “foreign” or Cold-War coded aesthetics  
- middle-ground, culturally legible performances are disproportionately absent  

This makes it a textbook example of **suppression by transmission control**, rather than outright banning.

*(Included in full for archival, comparative, and analytical purposes)*

> Arise ye pris’ners of starvation  
> Arise ye wretched of the earth  
> For justice thunders condemnation  
> A better world’s in birth!  
> No more tradition’s chains shall bind us  
> Arise, ye slaves, no more in thrall;  
> The earth shall rise on new foundations

>  
> **Refrain:**  
> ’Tis the final conflict  
> Let each stand in his place  
> The International Union  
> Shall be the human race.  
>  
> We want no condescending saviors  
> To rule us from their judgement hall  
> We workers ask not for their favors  
> Let us consult for all.  
> To make the thief disgorge his booty  
> To free the spirit from its cell  
> We must ourselves decide our duty  
> We must decide and do it well.  
>  
> The law oppresses us and tricks us,  
> The wage slave system drains our blood;  
> The rich are free from obligation,  
> The laws the poor delude.  
> Too long we’ve languished in subjection,  
> Equality has other laws;  
> “No rights,” says she, “without their duties,  
> No claims on equals without cause.”  
>  
> Behold them seated in their glory  
> The kings of mine and rail and soil!  
> What have you read in all their story,  
> But how they plundered toil?  
> Fruits of the workers’ toil are buried  
> In strongholds of the idle few  
> In working for their restitution  
> The men will only claim their due.  
>  
> We toilers from all fields united  
> Join hand in hand with all who work;  
> The earth belongs to us, the workers,  
> No room here for the shirk.  
> How many on our flesh have fattened!  
> But if the noisome birds of prey  
> Shall vanish from the sky some morning  
> The blessed sunlight then will stay.

## 3. A Contemporary Rewrite (Working Draft)

*(Included as an illustrative example of structural translation, not as a finished work)*

> Arise you doomscrollers from your feeds  
> Arise you prisoners of dopamine  
> For going irl now thunders  
> And at last ends the age of screens.  
> Tell all your doubts to go away  
> Brain rot and anxiety must end.  
> We’ll change the ToS and make a better way  
> And no refunds or responsibility will come to an end.  
>  
> **Refrain:**  
> So let us come together  
> And the online fight let us face  
> The Internationale unites the human race.  
>  
> No more deluded by reactions  
> On tyrants only we’ll make war  
> The soldiers too will take strike action  
> They’ll break ranks and fight no more  
> And if those cannibals keep trying  
> To click-bait our pride  
> They soon shall hear their stocks dying  
> We’ll cancel every subscription, on our side.  
>  
> No saviour from on high delivers,  
> No faith have we in prince or peer.  
> Our own right hand the chains must shiver,  
> Algorithms of hatred, greed, and fear.  
> We deprive the data from faceless companies,  
> And give everyone a happier feed.  
> Everyone must kick these controllers out and off,  
> To keep us all safe from their greed.

This draft demonstrates how **the same emotive and organisational functions** can be re-expressed in a contemporary control environment (platforms, data extraction, algorithmic governance) without changing the underlying structure.

## 4. Emotive Songs as Coordination Technologies

Songs like *The Internationale* operate differently from speeches or essays:

- they compress values into memory  
- they synchronise emotion and tempo  
- they lower cognitive overhead for collective action  
- they encourage simultaneity rather than deliberation  

This makes them **especially effective**, but also **especially threatening** to large systems that depend on variance reduction and individualised engagement.

This is not unique to leftist songs.  
Many national anthems are equally violent, martial, or absolutist — they are simply normalised through state endorsement.

The distinction is not brutality.  
It is **who controls the emotional synchronisation**.

## 5. Algorithmic Framing and the “Scarecrow Effect”

In contemporary platforms, *The Internationale* often survives only in:
- overtly Soviet or Cold-War visual packaging  
- contexts marked as “extreme,” “foreign,” or “ideological”  

Moderate, culturally familiar performances (e.g. US folk traditions, labour history contexts) are disproportionately missing.

This creates an **artificial binary**:
- either the song is invisible  
- or it appears only in a form that signals “you should be afraid of this”  

This benefits:
- polarising political vehicles  
- simplistic threat narratives  
- foreign-coded extremism framings  

…and harms:
- historical literacy  
- democratic cultural continuity  
- good-faith curiosity  

Importantly, this is often achieved **without explicit censorship** — through ranking, recommendation, and contextual isolation.

## 6. Why Songs Are More Vulnerable Than Speeches

Speeches:
- are linear  
- require attention  
- are cognitively heavy  
- fragment easily  

Songs:
- propagate horizontally  
- bypass argument  
- synchronise bodies as well as beliefs  

As a result, emotive songs are:
- more likely to be dampened  
- more likely to be mislabelled  
- more likely to be “handled” rather than debated  

This is a structural property of media systems, not a moral judgement.

## 7. Why This Case Matters

This case illustrates a broader pattern:

> Cultural artefacts that enable collective recognition and shared agency are more likely to be suppressed than those that merely express opinion.

Understanding this pattern is essential for:
- democratic resilience  
- media literacy  
- distinguishing suppression from disagreement

## 8. Status

- This note is **descriptive**, not advocative.  
- Inclusion does not imply endorsement.  
- The purpose is **pattern recognition**, not mobilisation.
