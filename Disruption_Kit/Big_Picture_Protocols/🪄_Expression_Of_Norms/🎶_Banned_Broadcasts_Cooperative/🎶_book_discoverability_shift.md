# 🎶 Book Discoverability Shift (2022 Title)  
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Observation log of sudden visibility changes for the 2022 book.*  

---

## 📄 What Happened  
- Within one week, search results shifted:  
  - **Before:** hostile JSTOR 2018 review on page 1.  
  - **Now:** book itself appears “fine” on Google; hostile review buried to page 4.  
- A **REDACTED Think Tank** lists the book with the **wrong year** in bios/policy papers.  

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- Rankings fluctuate as new material appears.  
- SEO updates weekly.  
- Institutions occasionally misdate publications.  

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- Narrow search terms no longer return the once-prominent review.  
- Misdating replicated in external summaries, potentially breaking citation trails.  
- Sharp discoverability change in under 7 days.  

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** Algorithm refresh; publisher metadata updates; fresh online mentions.  
- **Containment:** Initial boosting of hostile review, later burial; misdating to disrupt indexing; narrative reshaping post-release.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🎶 🔍 🪄 🧿 — This node sits in the metadata interference register, tracing how small changes in search visibility reshape a book’s life.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *Fahrenheit 451* (Ray Bradbury) — suppression through absence and misdirection.  
- *The Shadow Lines* (Amitav Ghosh) — memory, archives, and how records slip.  
- *Invisible Cities* (Italo Calvino) — things exist only where described.  

**Extended constellation (legal/technical):**  
- Google Search algorithm updates (2022–2023) — volatility in rankings.  
- UK Defamation Act 2013 — relevance to buried/boosted reviews.  
- Cases on digital right-to-be-forgotten (e.g. *Google Spain v AEPD*, 2014).
