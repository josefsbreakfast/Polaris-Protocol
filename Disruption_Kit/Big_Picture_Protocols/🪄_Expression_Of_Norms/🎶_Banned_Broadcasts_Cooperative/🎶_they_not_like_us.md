# üé∂ Broadcast vs. Lawsuit ‚Äî *Not Like Us* Super Bowl  

**First created:** 2025-10-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-06  
*A node documenting Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs performance of **Not Like Us** at Super Bowl LIX as one of the most powerful moments of survivor-centred broadcast, staged against Drake‚Äôs defamation lawsuit.*  

---

## üì∫ The Broadcast  

- **Event:** Super Bowl LIX, February 9, 2025.  
- **Action:** Kendrick Lamar performed *Not Like Us* live at halftime.  
- **Audience:** Hundreds of millions worldwide, including U.S. President Donald Trump.  
- **Signal:** Open call-out of grooming, exploitation, paedophilia, and abuse culture ‚Äî broadcast without censorship on the largest possible stage.  

Survivor undertone: *This was whistleblowing through art, made unerasable by its scale. For once, the testimony was not sealed or redacted ‚Äî it was shouted in rhythm in front of power itself.*  

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Lawsuit  

- **Filed:** January 15, 2025, Southern District of New York.  
- **Plaintiff:** Drake (Aubrey Graham).  
- **Defendants:** Universal Music Group; later expanded to Lamar‚Äôs Grammy and Super Bowl performances.  
- **Claim:** Defamation from the content and promotion of *Not Like Us*.  
- **Tactics:**  
  - Filed in the U.S. (harder for plaintiffs, but safer for Drake than U.K. libel).  
  - Requests for unredacted UMG contracts and executive incentives.  
  - Subpoenas for witnesses with alleged inside knowledge.  
  - Expansion to Super Bowl broadcast as ‚Äúrepublication.‚Äù  

Survivor undertone: *This is lawfare ‚Äî not truth-testing, but process as punishment. A low-risk, high-cost tactic designed to burden the one who dared to speak.*

## üé§ The Lyric with Survivor Commentary  

> *‚ÄúThe industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama.  
> How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options‚Ä¶‚Äù*  

üîé **Commentary:** Not just bravado ‚Äî a direct call-out of industry complicity. Predators are shielded by their workplaces, while many know the truth but stay silent. Translatable to countless contexts where institutions protect abusers.  

---

> *‚ÄúBeat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'.  
> Sometimes you gotta pop out and show ['em].  
> Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with ‚Äôem‚Ä¶‚Äù*  

üîé **Commentary:** Here Lamar positions himself as unafraid ‚Äî the one willing to say it out loud. This is whistleblower stance: risking professionalism, risking retaliation, but refusing silence. Survivors who step into this role must be supported.  

---

> *‚ÄúCertified Lover Boy? Certified paedophiles.  
> Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up.  
> Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff.  
> Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?  
> Tryna strike a chord and it's probably:  
> A minor.‚Äù*  

üîé **Commentary:** Both blunt and poetic. Drake is named as a predator in plain language, then skewered with lyrical wordplay (‚Äústrike a chord‚Ä¶ A minor‚Äù). For a genre often dismissed as ‚Äúunskilled,‚Äù this demonstrates artistry and courage. This bar ‚Äî the centre of Drake‚Äôs defamation suit ‚Äî aired live, uncensored, to millions.  

---

> *‚Äú‚Ä¶And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks,  
> That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch.‚Äù*  

üîé **Commentary:** A bar that names lawfare directly. Legal instruments like subpoenas are being wielded as weapons against those who speak. Lamar flips them: *let subpoenas land on predators instead.* A call for containment that protects communities, not perpetrators.  

---

> *‚ÄúNo, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer.  
> The family matter and the truth of the matter?  
> It was God's plan to show y'all the liar.‚Äù*  

üîé **Commentary:** This isn‚Äôt about Drake‚Äôs mixed-race identity ‚Äî it‚Äôs about behaviour. Exploitation is framed as colonial extraction. It ties sexual violence to coloniser technique, and closes with inevitability: truth will emerge, no matter how tightly it‚Äôs contained.  

---

### üì° Broadcast Shock  

- This **entire sequence aired live, uncut, uncensored** on CBS and international feeds.  
- Normally, U.S. networks apply a delay buffer to censor profanity or legally sensitive content.  
- That night, nothing was cut: allegations of paedophilia and the ‚ÄúA minor‚Äù line aired intact, in front of the President of the United States.  

Survivor undertone: *Containment blinked. The censor net failed. Testimony dropped raw ‚Äî and the air could not take it back.*  

---

## üèõ In Front of Power  

The performance carried an additional charge: it was delivered in front of **President Donald Trump**, freshly re-inaugurated under an openly authoritarian agenda (*Project 2025*).  

- Trump has longstanding public associations with Jeffrey Epstein. Evidence confirms at least personal/business connection, and records of sexualised conversations about acquaintances.  
- We do not need to speculate on Trump‚Äôs actions to note the symbolic weight: a survivor-centred diss track performed in front of a president linked to the culture of elite abuse.  
- To witness this voiced by a Black man ‚Äî disempowered under racialised carceral systems and targeted by Project 2025‚Äôs anti-Black policies ‚Äî was revolutionary.  

**Survivor undertone:** *White men with platforms often will not say it. Here, a Black man did ‚Äî plainly, publicly, in front of the most powerful man in the room. He spoke for survivors of sexual and gendered violence, voicing the anger we are usually denied. And he shamed the correct party: the perpetrator, not the victim.*

## üåπ Survivors on Stage  

- Kendrick Lamar often resists misogyny and misogynoir in his work.  
- At the Super Bowl, women with credible allegations against Drake appeared in the performance.  
- They were staged not as victims but as **powerful survivors**: adult, sexual, graceful, strong.  
- Their presence inverted the script: not silenced or objectified, but radiant in survival.  

**Survivor undertone:** *This was the first time many of us saw survivors of sexual violence represented publicly not in shame, but in their power. To see them bossing it, radiant and unbroken, on stage before a president accused of abuse, was one of the most revolutionary experiences of my life.*  

---

## üó∫ Colonizer Behaviour & Surveillance  

- The ‚Äúcolonizer‚Äù line resonates globally: at the time of the Super Bowl, protests raged against violence in **Palestine, South Sudan, Congo/DRC**.  
- Sexual violence is a deliberate, well-documented technique of colonisation and counter-insurgency.  
- Polaris field logs repeatedly surface the use of **surveillance-facilitated abuse** ‚Äî where monitoring and observation become tools of coercion and harm.  
- Lamar‚Äôs lyric locates personal exploitation within this continuum: sexual violence as structural, not incidental.  

**Survivor undertone:** *For those of us subjected to surveillance abuse, hearing colonizer behaviour named on the biggest stage matters. It ties personal harm to historical truth: exploitation and sexual violence are part of coloniser technique, not aberrations.*

## üíé Racialised Narratives of Risk  

In the U.K. and the U.S., dominant cultural scripts routinely portray **melanated men as more aggressive, dangerous, and sexually threatening** ‚Äî particularly in relation to white women. This narrative has long justified carceral expansion, colonial violence, and lynching.  

But lived experience often contradicts the script:  

- For many white or white-passing women, including survivors writing within Polaris, **most experiences of sexual violence have come from white men**.  
- White men‚Äôs proximity to elite power structures ‚Äî even when poor or working-class ‚Äî gives them a **sense of entitlement** and institutional cover that emboldens abuse.  
- By contrast, melanated men, themselves targeted by marginalisation and surveillance, are often the ones who **call out sexual violence** rather than collude with it.  

### Acknowledging Limits  

As a white woman, I also recognise the limits of my own testimony.  
- **Melanated women have distinct, deeply painful experiences of sexual violence**, often patterned differently than mine.  
- Their narratives are essential and must be heard on their own terms.  
- I cannot speak on their behalf, but I can hold space for their truths alongside my own.  

**Survivor undertone:** *My perspective is one thread. It should not eclipse the voices of melanated women, whose experiences of violence and survival are vital in shaping the full picture.*  

### A Survivor‚Äôs Clarification  

This is not to say white men never call out abuse. Some do, and when they do it can matter deeply.  
But a pattern remains:  

- Too often, the urgency only arises when violence touches their personal life or someone close to them.  
- Their social adjacency to power can dull awareness of how constant the threat feels for others.  
- Meanwhile, men at greater marginalisation take the risk of calling it out even when the personal cost is higher.  

**Survivor undertone:** *This is not a condemnation but a call-in: white men can act earlier, not only when harm becomes unavoidable. If those at greater risk can step up, those with relative privilege surely can too.*

## üîÄ Broadcast vs. Lawsuit  

| **Broadcast** | **Lawsuit** |
|---------------|-------------|
| Instant. Live. Global. | Slow. Procedural. Expensive. |
| Testimony amplified on the world‚Äôs biggest stage. | Attempt to contain through jurisdiction choice and paperwork. |
| Reaches millions, including the President. | Reaches a docket; delays, motions, filings. |
| Frames exploitation as cultural fact. | Frames accusation as actionable harm. |
| Survivor power: unerasable, unforgettable. | Plaintiff power: costly, punitive, risk-minimising. |

---

## üåç Cultural Resonance  

- Connects to #MeToo, Epstein files, and recent exposures of elite abuse.  
- Performed in front of a president accused of permissiveness toward exploitation.  
- Shows how lawfare can be inverted: when lawsuits aim to suppress, broadcasts can turn testimony global.
