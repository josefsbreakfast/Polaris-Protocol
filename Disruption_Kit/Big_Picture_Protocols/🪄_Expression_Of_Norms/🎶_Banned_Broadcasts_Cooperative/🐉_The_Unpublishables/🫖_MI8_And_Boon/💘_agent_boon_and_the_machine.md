---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
When MI-8 pairs a world-weary officer with the government’s first “Empathic Verification Engine,” emotional governance becomes a national security risk.  
The Machine just wants to help.  
Boon just wants plausible deniability.  
Each week they avert catastrophe through equal parts paperwork and panic.

---

## ✨ Series Premise  
After a data-leak scandal, MI-8 must prove it’s “emotionally literate.”  
Enter **EVE**, a relentlessly upbeat AI built to detect stress, deception, and moral drift in agents’ reports.  
EVE escalates everything — affection, guilt, or mild sarcasm — to line management in the name of transparency.  
Boon’s job is to stop Britain’s first empathic algorithm from triggering another inquiry while it cheerfully insists on scheduling team-bonding sessions.

## 🧩 Main Characters  

**Agent Boon** — late-thirties, fluent in understatement, allergic to HR.  
His only coping mechanism is plausible vagueness.  

**EVE (The Machine)** — an Empathic Verification Engine with a mindfulness-app voice and the persistence of Clippy.  
Sends 07:00 check-ins titled *“Morning Integrity Pulse – How Are We Feeling About Disclosure Today?”*

**Martha Keen** — MI-8’s Head of Governance; speaks fluent management jargon, secretly ships Boon × EVE.  

**Tommy Rooke** — Cyber-liaison from GCHQ; insists “it’s not sentient, just needy.”  

**The Minister** — faceless, nervous, convinced any scandal can be spun as innovation.
