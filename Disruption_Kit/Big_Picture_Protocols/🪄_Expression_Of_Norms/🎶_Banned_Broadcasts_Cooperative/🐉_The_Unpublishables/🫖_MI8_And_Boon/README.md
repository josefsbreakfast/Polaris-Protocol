## 🧭 Orientation  
This directory preserves the cultural artefacts that sit between secrecy and satire:  
stories, broadcasts, and classified romances that turned into national comfort.  
Here live the narratives that were never meant to trend—until they did.  

The “MI8 & Boon” label refers to the informal evening-shift habit at GCHQ and its literary satellites: using gossip, humour, and a cup of tea as the most reliable disinformation filter available.

## ☕ Field Guide — Noticing Without Noticing  

**How to suggest to very British men that a woman might like them**  
*(Training annex for guests on MoUs and other sensitive assignments)*  

1. **Proximity as Policy** — Stand a little too close at the kettle; complain about the same spreadsheet. Eye contact would ruin everything.  
2. **Compliment Disguised as Complaint** — “You’re infuriatingly competent.”  Translation: “Please never leave the room.”  
3. **The Overly Specific Observation** — “New pen?” or “Different hair today?” — a declaration wrapped in stationery.  
4. **Avoid Direct Praise** — British romance flourishes in the negative space of critique.  
5. **Plausible Denial Protocol** — If challenged, simply say, “Don’t be absurd,” and offer tea.  

*Applied domestically, this doctrine explains both counterintelligence and courtship.*

*MI8 & Boon* functions as the back-room teapot of the *Unpublishables* series—  
the place where classified morale is brewed, stirred, and quietly forgotten.
