# ☕️🫖 *Extremely Good for Morale*  
**First created:** 2025-10-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*A love story about data integrity, plausible deniability, and the great British gift for distraction.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
In the middle of a minor proxy war and a major audit, two analysts—one once destined for medicine, one trained by the establishment to improvise within rules—discover that their data streams are entangled.  
Their correspondence begins as bureaucracy, becomes conspiracy, and ends up as gossip.  
The government, relieved to have found a story that is neither tragic nor treasonous, lets the country talk about the romance instead of the breach.

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **The Pink-Mountain Doctrine** — hide the secret in plain sight, ridiculous enough that no one believes it.  
- **The Inter-Agency Academic Liaison Pilot (IAALP)** — the “programme” that exists because it’s already being referenced.  
- **The Provenance Breach** — a ghost dataset rewriting the national mood.  
- **Extremely Good for Morale** — official verdict on everything that follows.

## 🔍 Story  

### I.  *The Breach*  
It began with twin datasets arguing over time stamps.  
He saw it from Defence; she saw it from Medicine.  
They met across a firewall that both swore was one-way only.

> “You missed a semicolon,” he said.  
> “I didn’t miss it,” she said. “I liberated it.”  

By the time they noticed their feeds had merged, so had their insomnia.

### II.  *The Cover Story*  
Whitehall invented IAALP overnight.  
Acronyms breed faster than guilt.  
Parliament announced an enquiry no one planned to hold.  
The Palace issued a line about “splendid cross-disciplinary collaboration.”  
The public, grateful for anything unsinister, sighed in relief.

> “They’ve been putting in very long hours,” said the breakfast presenter, smiling.  
> Britain believed her.

### III.  *The Gossip Cycle*  
First came the memes, then the fanfic, then the panel show jokes.  
The nation that once survived blitzes and austerity survived this too—by finding it charming.  
Hope-not-Hate did a feature on “mixed families in modern Britain.”  
Two academics kissed by a vending machine became the domestic version of the Abraham Accords.  

At the Dog & Duck:  
> “Good for morale, though,” someone said.  
> “Extremely,” said the landlord, pulling a pint.

### IV.  *The Quiet After*  
Six months later the FOI request returned:  
327 pages, all blank, stamped *WITHDRAWN FOR CONTINUITY.*  
A single punctuation mark at the bottom: `;`

He watched the morning bulletin.  
She poured tea.  
They looked like people who’d finally slept.  
No one asked further questions.  
The nation, reassured, went back to work.

## 🏮 Footer  

*☕️🫖 Extremely Good for Morale* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records the way a country turns scandal into comfort, and how affection—public, private, or plausibly deniable—can be the most efficient cover story of all.  


*Survivor authorship is sovereign.  Containment is never neutral.*
