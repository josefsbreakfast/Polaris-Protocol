*Macro-overview of economic inequality, digital amplification, and scapegoat revival as early indicators of atrocity risk.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Before the camps or the militias, there is math.  
Not of bodies, yet—but of ratios: debt-to-dignity, feed-to-fear, share-to-shame.  
This node sketches how inequality, humiliation, and online mobilisation form a measurable physics of early-stage atrocity.  

The goal is not prediction but **calibration**.  
When fear becomes transmissible, when platforms reward rage, when belonging is rationed—mass violence is already in rehearsal.

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Economic gravity:** widening gaps in income and security distort moral horizons.  
- **Digital acceleration:** algorithmic amplification converts resentment into ideology.  
- **Scapegoat revival:** old hatreds find new carriers, dressed as “debate.”  
- **Threshold physics:** small nudges—policy, headline, meme—tilt the whole field.  
- **Counter-gravities:** civic solidarity, literacy, and care resist collapse.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1  Inequality as Potential Energy  
Every crisis of legitimacy begins with disproportionality.  
When survival costs rise faster than recognition, societies accumulate combustible tension.  
Authoritarian movements harvest this potential energy by re-describing exploitation as moral failure of the poor or foreign.  
The physics is moral: as the gap between wealth and worth widens, empathy thins to a filament.

### 2  Digital Amplification and Distributed Rage  
Traditional propaganda required a ministry; now it only needs a metric.  
Engagement algorithms reward outrage more efficiently than any censor ever could.  
Each repost is a micro-delegation of enforcement—a unit of distributed authoritarianism explored in 📡 *Algorithmic Statecraft*.  
When collective pain becomes gamified emotion, cruelty feels participatory, even civic.

### 3  Scapegoat Recurrence  
Economic stress demands explanation; prejudice offers a cheap one.  
The “folk physics” of blame slides from migrants to minorities to feminists, echoing patterns mapped in 🧠 *Linguistic Drift of Scapegoating* and 🧨 *Manufacturing the Scapegoat*.  
The unit of hatred stays constant; only the label changes.  
Today’s Islamophobia performs the same social work as pre-Holocaust antisemitism: it converts anxiety into permission.

### 4  Threshold Moments  
Atrocity rarely announces itself.  
Instead, watch for frictionless shifts: jokes without laughter, slogans turned safety doctrine, emergency powers that never expire.  
Physics calls this *phase change*; politics calls it *normalisation*.  
The violence is incremental, opportunistic, cumulative—its rhythm a slow acceleration punctuated by opportunist shocks.

### 5  Counter-Gravities  
Resistance begins where witnesses notice drift early.  
Economic literacy, narrative sabotage, and civic solidarity act as counter-forces—keeping the moral field from total collapse.  
Micro-acts of refusal—fact-checking, neighbour protection, humour that deflates cruelty—reintroduce friction into authoritarian momentum.  
See 🌤️ *When Authoritarianism and Genocide Are Resisted* for empirical casework on how solidarity slows the slide.

## ⚙️ Underlying Mechanics  

| Variable | Description | Early Indicator |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Wealth Disparity Index** | Concentration of capital, fall in social mobility | Public cynicism; “system rigged” rhetoric |
| **Information Entropy** | Noise-to-signal ratio in media | Conspiracy clustering; distrust of expertise |
| **Affective Velocity** | Speed at which outrage travels | Sudden spikes of identical phrasing across feeds |
| **Legitimacy Lag** | Time between injustice and institutional response | Vigilantism; decline in complaint trust |
| **Civic Inertia** | Social fatigue, burnout, hopelessness | Withdrawal from protest; irony replacing empathy |

These variables form the “physics engine” of atrocity risk: the faster outrage circulates in an unequal field, the less energy is needed to spark coordinated harm.

## 🧮 Comparative Frame  

| Era | Trigger Energy | Transmission Medium | Primary Scapegoat | Collapse Prevention |
|------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **1930s Europe** | War debt, humiliation | Print + rallies | Jews, Roma, Left | Labour movements, resistance networks |
| **1970s West** | De-industrialisation | Television, tabloids | “Coloured” / migrant workers | Civil-rights coalitions |
| **2020s Global** | Pandemic, austerity | Social-media algorithms | Muslims, refugees, “woke” citizens | Digital literacy, intersectional solidarity |

## 🧠 Human Factor  

Stress narrows perception. Under chronic strain, people crave simplicity and certainty—the psychological “snap” that authoritarianism offers.  
This doesn’t make them monsters; it makes them tired.  
Prevention therefore starts with **collective recovery**: rest, belonging, agency.  
A burnt-out populace is a conductor; a cared-for populace is an insulator.

## 🏮 Footer  

🧭 *Early-Stage Atrocity Physics* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It defines the baseline mechanics of how economic and digital forces combine to generate early atrocity risk—and how survivor analysis can detect that tilt before impact.
