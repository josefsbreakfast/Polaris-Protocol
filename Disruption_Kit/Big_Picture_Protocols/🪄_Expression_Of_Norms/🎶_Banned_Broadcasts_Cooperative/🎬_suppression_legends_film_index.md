# 🎬 Suppression Legends Film Index  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Films that became cultural detonators precisely because someone tried to mute them.*

## 🎞️ Concept  

This node gathers films whose **suppression became the story** — works that gained longevity, reverence, or cult status because they were censored, banned, pulled, or buried.  

Some were targeted for political messaging. Others became inconvenient in retrospect. All survived because audiences *refused to forget them*.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🎬 🔥 📜 🧿 🕸️ — This node collects cultural artefacts that survived suppression attempts,  
serving as **reference points for state memory control, dissent, and rupture**.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *Battleship Potemkin* (1925) — censored in many countries, canonised later.  
- *Salt of the Earth* (1954) — banned in the U.S. for union and feminist politics.  
- *La Haine* (1995) — embraced as cinema, censored in music’s parallel struggle.  
- *4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days* (2007) — Romanian film on abortion under Ceaușescu, initially blocked in distribution.  

**Extended constellation (legal/historical):**  
- *Obscene Publications Act* cases (UK, 1960s–80s) — used to block political/cultural films.  
- U.S. “Hollywood Blacklist” era — careers ended, works suppressed.  
- Indian Censor Board bans (1970s–present).  
- Documentary suppression in Israel/Palestine (e.g. *Tantura*, *Jenin, Jenin*).

## 🏮 Footer  

*🎬 Suppression Legends Film Index* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It collates cinematic works that became amplified by attempts to silence them,  
and supports broader diagnostics of narrative control across media formats.
