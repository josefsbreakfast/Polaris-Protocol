## ✨ Introduction  
Not all contraband wears the form of a weapon.  
In Blair-era Britain, it was books on wallpaper paste, protest cookery, and lock-on tactics that were targeted.  

When police raided activists with *Recipes for Disaster* or *Annika’s Cookbook*, it wasn’t because these texts posed physical danger — it was because they posed **legitimacy danger**. They handed ordinary people the tools of protest, lowering the entry barrier to dissent.  

This is the logic of containment: what gets suppressed are not the machetes in fascist basements, but the manuals that make resistance accessible.

## 📕 1. Blair-Era Bans  
- In the 2000s, UK authorities banned certain anarchist or counterculture texts to balance prosecutions of jihadist literature.  
- Targets included: *Recipes for Disaster*, *Annika’s Cookbook*, and other DIY handbooks.  
- Content was mundane: wallpaper paste recipes, community cooking, banner painting, bike repair, lock-on tactics.  
- In effect, the state criminalised **arts and crafts for grown-ups** — not insurrection.

## ❓ 2. Why Ban Them?  
- These manuals embarrassed police when protesters deployed low-level disruption (going floppy, refusing cooperation).  
- They lowered the barrier of entry for ordinary people to join protest by making tactics accessible.  
- The ban was about containment optics, not safety: preventing legitimacy erosion, not preventing harm.

## ⚖️ 3. Contrast with the Far Right  
- **Under-policing.** Fascist groups with literal rooms full of machetes or firearms were often dismissed as “boys with toys” until lethal.  
- **Over-policing.** Leftists with books about cooking paste were raided and prosecuted.  
- **Bias.** Left = dangerous early. Right = tolerated late. The asymmetry reveals the racialised and hierarchical logic of policing.

## 📜 4. Knowledge as Contraband  
- DIY manuals were treated like weapons because they enabled independent organisation.  
- Suppression of knowledge is suppression of legitimacy: communities capable of self-governance threaten state optics.  
- Books become contraband when they teach cooperation, not destruction.

## 🌌 Constellations  

📚 ⚖️ ❓ 🔥 — This node sits in the outlaw knowledge constellation, mapping how manuals and handbooks are policed when they enable solidarity.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *Anarchist Cookbook* (1971) — often cited, often banned, more symbol than substance.  
- *There Is Nothing So Whole as a Broken Heart* (ed. Cindy Milstein) — anarchist practice and care.  
- *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* (Paulo Freire) — teaching as liberation.  
- *Mao’s Little Red Book* — read as insurgent manual, globally policed for symbolism.  

**Extended constellation (legal/historical):**  
- Terrorism Act 2000 (UK) — broad powers used against texts.  
- Cases where possession of “manuals” was prosecuted despite banal content.  
- Comparative: U.S. bans on radical zines and DIY protest guides.

## 🏮 Footer  

*📚 Knowledge Policing and Banned Books* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how states criminalise DIY manuals while ignoring extremist arsenals, revealing suppression as a matter of optics and legitimacy rather than danger.
