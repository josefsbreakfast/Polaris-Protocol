**First created:** 2025-10-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Entry point for suppression audit methodologies across books, media, and cultural works.*  

---

## 🌱 Purpose  

This cluster develops **forensic audit protocols** for detecting when books, films, albums, or other cultural works are **suppressed, shadowed, or quietly withdrawn**.  
It provides standardised methods, templates, and case-log structures so survivors and researchers can:  

- Compare *baseline expectations* (ISBNs, festival screenings, announced releases) with *real-world circulation*.  
- Quantify **visibility gaps**.  
- Preserve **evidence chains**.  
- Document **case studies** safely.
