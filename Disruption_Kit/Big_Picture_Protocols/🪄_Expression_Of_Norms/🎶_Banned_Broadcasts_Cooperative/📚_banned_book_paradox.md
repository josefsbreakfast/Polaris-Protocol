# 📚 The Banned Book Paradox

*Why censorship immortalises the very texts it seeks to erase.*

## 🍄 How It Works  
- **Curiosity trigger:** “Don’t read this” = the red button everyone wants to press.  
- **Romanticisation:** even abusive or trash material (*Lolita*, *A Clockwork Orange*) gets reframed as daring, glamorous, “forbidden.”  
- **Immortalisation:** political or resistant works (*Maus*, dissident samizdat, Zafón’s *Labyrinth of the Spirits*) gain mythic afterlife.  
- **Symbolic weight:** neutral works (*Lady Chatterley’s Lover*) become totems of freedom because someone once tried to erase them.

## 🌿 Why It Matters  
- **Trash to treasure:** low-quality texts survive because of the mystique.  
- **Treasure to torchlight:** vital works become emblems of resistance.  
- **Reader psychology:** literary readers are primed for curiosity — suppression makes reading feel like activism.

## 🕷️ The Paradox  
Banning is meant to silence. In practice, it glamorises, advertises, and immortalises. The very act of prohibition is what guarantees a book’s survival.  

✨ **Takeaway:** every list of banned books is not an erasure — it’s an invitation.
