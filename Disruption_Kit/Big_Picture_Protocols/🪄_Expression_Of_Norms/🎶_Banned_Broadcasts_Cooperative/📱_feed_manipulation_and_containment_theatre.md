*How platforms suppress by substitution and pastel distraction rather than silence.*  

---

## ✨ Introduction  
Suppression today often wears a pastel mask.  
Content is not burned or banned outright — it is buried.  
A survivor’s testimony, a political thread, a sharp critique: each can vanish not by deletion, but by being drowned in **weddings, balloons, and baby photos**.  

This is not accident. It is **containment theatre** — the performance of neutrality through floods of “wholesome” content that smother what cannot be directly silenced.  

---

## 🔄 1. Suppression by Substitution  
- Content is not deleted, but **smothered** by floods of “wholesome” posts.  
- Example: political testimony followed by sudden walls of weddings, babies, family fluff.  
- Function: not to silence, but to **bury in softness** — neutralising sharp content under sentimentality.  

---

## 🎭 2. Containment Theatre  
- Suppression presented as *“just how the feed works.”*  
- In reality: a deliberate containment script, replacing hostile content with distraction.  
- Like theatre, the gestures are symbolic: performance of safety rather than actual neutrality.  

---

## 🧾 3. Diagnostics  
Signs a feed is under containment mode:  
- **Random variety** replaced by suspicious uniformity.  
- **Pastel clustering** — sudden surges of soft, gentle imagery.  
- **Timing mismatch** — heavy post → drowned within hours by trivial floods.  
- **Cross-platform echo** — identical motifs (balloons, weddings, babies) appearing across different platforms.

## ♻️ 4. Containment Paradox  
- Smears and suppression loops can backfire.  
- The more someone is painted unsafe, the clearer it becomes they are credible.  
- Example: IDF detractors smeared heavily, but smear campaigns revealed more about state panic than the people themselves.

## 🌌 Constellations  

📱 🎭 🧾 ♻️ — This node belongs to the algorithmic suppression constellation, tracking how platforms bury dissent in curated distraction.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *The Truman Show* (1998) — reality curated as theatre.  
- *The Circle* (Dave Eggers, 2013) — soft opacity of total surveillance.  
- Instagram/TikTok “pastel waves” — political erasure through lifestyle aesthetic.  

**Extended constellation (legal/technical):**  
- Content moderation contracts — substitution disguised as neutrality.  
- Algorithmic “trust and safety” regimes — designating protest as “sensitive.”  
- Shadowbanning litigation — attempts to expose invisible throttling.

*📱 Feed Manipulation and Containment Theatre* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how platforms perform suppression through substitution, smothering sharp content under curated softness.
