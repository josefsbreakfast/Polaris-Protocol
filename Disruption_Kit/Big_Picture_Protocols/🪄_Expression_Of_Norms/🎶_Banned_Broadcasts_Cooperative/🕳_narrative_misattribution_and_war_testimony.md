# 🕳 Narrative Misattribution and War Testimony

*How survivor testimony is smeared, misattributed, and inverted into containment.*  

---

## ✨ Introduction  
When survivors speak of torture, war crimes, or systemic abuse, they are rarely met with clean listening.  
Instead, their words are redirected, misattributed, or reframed until the testimony itself is treated as a threat.  

What should expose violence becomes ammunition for containment. Testimony is smeared, twisted into false allegations, or inverted into “evidence” of instability. The signal is never engaged — only the signaler attacked.  

---

## 📢 1. Testimony Under Attack  
- Survivors of war crimes and torture often face targeted suppression.  
- Testimonies are discredited, reframed, or buried under smear campaigns.  
- Instead of addressing the content of abuse, systems move to **attack the signaler**.  

---

## 🧍‍♂️ 2. Data Twin Misattribution  
- Survivor reports of harassment by one individual were misattributed to another — a “data twin.”  
- Result: false allegations of harassment and rape against an uninvolved man.  
- Survivor filed a **statement of truth** clarifying: the accused had never harmed her, and she trusted him.  
- Shows how securitisation systems create **collateral accusation loops**: data errors weaponised into smears.  

---

## 🔄 3. Containment Inversion  
- The harder smear campaigns tried to paint the “data twin” as unsafe, the clearer it became that he was trustworthy.  
- Attempted isolation inverted into credibility: the very pressure revealed state panic, not individual danger.  
- Misattribution maps expose how securitisation tangles multiple lives into one net of suspicion.

## ⚔️ 4. War, Torture, and Legitimacy  
- Testimony of psychological torture and physical interference was repeatedly dismissed as exaggeration or misidentification.  
- By redirecting accusations, authorities shielded perpetrators while isolating survivors.  
- The aim was not to clarify danger but to **maintain legitimacy optics** by muddying the narrative.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🕳 📡 📱 📚 — This node sits in the testimony suppression constellation, mapping how credibility is inverted into containment.  

**Extended constellation (cultural):**  
- *The Trial* (Franz Kafka) — accusations without origin, narrative without truth.  
- *The Act of Killing* (2012) — perpetrators narrating history while survivors are erased.  

**Extended constellation (legal/technical):**  
- International Criminal Court testimony procedures — credibility battles as containment.  
- Misidentification in counter-terrorism databases — “data twin” errors.  
- SLAPP suits against survivor memoirs — weaponised litigation to discredit testimony.

*🕳 Narrative Misattribution and War Testimony* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how survivor testimony is suppressed through smear, data twin misattribution, and inversion — turning credibility into evidence of danger.
