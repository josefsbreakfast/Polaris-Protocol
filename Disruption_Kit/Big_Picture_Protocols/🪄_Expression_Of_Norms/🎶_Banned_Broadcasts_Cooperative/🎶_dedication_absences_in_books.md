*Observation log of dedications and acknowledgments as metadata signals.*

## ✨ Introduction  
Most books open with a quiet note — a line or two naming who carried the author through the labour.  
A parent. A partner. A child. Sometimes an entire movement.  

Dedications and acknowledgments are paratext, but they matter: they map the networks of care and solidarity behind a work.  
They remind readers that books are not written in isolation — they are carried into being by relationships, debts, and communities.  

When those notes vanish, it is not always innocent.  
Sometimes the absence is an author’s own preference. Sometimes it is advised away by publishers or lawyers. And sometimes it functions as a kind of containment: the erasure of visible support networks, making the author appear solitary, ungrounded, unconnected.  

This log asks what such absences signal.

## 📄 What Happened  
- Dedications/acknowledgments nearly universal across genres.  
- Some works omit them — a deliberate choice, or advised omission.  
- Legal/publisher advice sometimes discourages naming people.  

---

## ✅ What’s Normal  
- 80–90% of trade books include dedications/acknowledgments.  
- Common to dedicate to spouse, partner, or children (gendered patterns).  
- Technical/academic works sometimes skip dedications.  

---

## 🚩 What’s Not Normal  
- Consistent absence of dedications across multiple authors.  
- Dedications cut during editing or proof.  
- Omission advised by legal counsel or publishers.  

---

## 🔍 Potential Explanations  
- **Benign:** Privacy; stylistic minimalism; fear of unprofessional tone.  
- **Containment:** Legal sanitisation; erasure of support networks; making author appear isolated.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🎶 Dedication Absences in Books* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It frames dedications as cultural metadata: inclusion signals labour’s social cost, while omission signals restraint or containment.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
