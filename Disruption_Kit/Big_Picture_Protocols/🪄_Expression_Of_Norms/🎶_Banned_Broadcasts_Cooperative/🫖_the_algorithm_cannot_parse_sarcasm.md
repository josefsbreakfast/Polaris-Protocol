# 🫖 The Algorithm Cannot Parse Sarcasm  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*Sarcasm as a cultural code the model cannot decode.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Sarcasm is a **shared-context performance**, not a semantic form.  
British sarcasm layers:

- irony  
- faux indignation  
- deadpan sincerity  
- tonal inversion  
- comedic despair  

Models cannot parse these without cultural embedding.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Sarcasm = context, not content  
- Why sarcasm reads as hostility  
- Why AI cannot infer shared assumptions  
- Thick of It as a stress-test

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Sarcasm Depends on Knowing What’s Expected  
The model knows the sentence;  
it does not know **the expectations the sentence violates**.

### 2. Sarcasm Breaks Literal Safety Layers  
“No, brilliant idea, let’s definitely escalate the genocide”  
reads as **endorsement**, not condemnation.

### 3. Sarcasm Uses Tone Without Tone Markers  
Humans infer tone from cultural cues.  
AI reads surface text → flags “danger.”

### 4. Satire ≠ Extremism  
But to a literalist classifier, both are shaped alike.
