# 🧬 Algorithmic Endocrinology  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Algorithmic Ecology & Endocrine Governance — how precision systems start to act like hormones.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

*Algorithmic Endocrinology* studies the hormonal behaviour of data systems.  
When predictive engines and optimisation loops are designed to *balance* social or informational “health,” they begin to imitate the logic of the body’s endocrine system — feedback-driven, homeostatic, and sometimes self-poisoning.

This folder tracks how digital architectures secrete influence, dose attention, and regulate emotion through feedback signals.  
It belongs to **🪄 Expression Of Norms**, the branch of *Big Picture Protocols* concerned with how moral and behavioural expectations are written into code, metrics, and institutional design.

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Algorithmic Ecology** — systems interacting like organisms within an ecosystem; precision without full context breeds fragility.  
- **Endocrine Governance** — institutions attempting to modulate public “mood hormones” via algorithmic feedback loops.  
- **Precision Illusion** — the false promise that more data yields more truth; mirrors the over-hormoning of the digital body.  
- **Algorithmic Invasiveness (DEET Effect)** — tracing how micro-targeted nudges act as behavioural pheromones.  
- **Governance & Oversight in Algorithmic Health** — comparing biological regulation models with data-oversight architectures.  
- **Ethical Ecology of Design** — grounding algorithmic systems in ecological humility rather than extractive optimisation.

**Legend:**  
*Signal → Perception → Hormone → Target → Feedback → Regulator → (back to) Perception.*  
Where regulation fails or is captured, the loop drifts toward **pathologies**: over-dosing attention, punitive throttling, or performative “health” that harms the ecosystem.

*🧬 Algorithmic Endocrinology* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It examines how feedback-based governance borrows the language and logic of biology, revealing the hormonal economy of modern algorithms.
