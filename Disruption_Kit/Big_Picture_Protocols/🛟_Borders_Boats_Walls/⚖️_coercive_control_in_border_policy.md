# ⚖️ Coercive Control in Border Policy  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-28  
*Analysis of how coercive control logics are embedded in border regimes, visa systems, and migration governance.*  

---

## Scope  
This node examines how **coercive control**, usually understood in personal or domestic contexts, also maps directly onto **border policy and migration systems**.  
Key concern: border regimes exert control not only through surveillance, but also through visa dependencies, manufactured scarcity, and racialised hierarchies of privilege.  

---

## Cohesion in Multiple Directions  
- **State → Migrant:** Surveillance, detention, and paperwork act as coercive levers. Migrants are kept in states of prolonged uncertainty, mirroring personal coercive dynamics.  
- **Migrant → State:** The very presence of migrants is framed as a test of border “strength.” This feeds nationalistic cohesion, justifying authoritarian measures as acts of collective self-protection.  
- **Border Regime ↔ Migration Networks:** Visa regimes, employment restrictions, and housing exclusions create extended lattices of control across daily life.  

---

## Visa & Documentation as Leverage  
- Sudden changes in visa rules or fees (sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars) produce **unrealistic expectations** for planning or saving.  
- Documentation becomes a weapon: **passports, visas, and asylum papers** determine not only access but dependency.  
- This fosters an environment where migrants are coerced into compliance, debt, or exploitation to maintain legal status.  

---

## Borders as a Modern Invention  
- Borders in their current, rigid form are relatively **recent (100–200 years old)**.  
- Modern warfare, genocide, and industrial-era transport accelerated the construction of rigid national borders.  
- The **myth of timeless borders** is itself part of the coercive apparatus.  

---

## Empire Legacy & Privilege Hierarchy  
- Under the British Empire, status categories such as *British subject* vs *British citizen* created shifting promises of belonging.  
- People born in colonies (India, Pakistan, Africa, Caribbean) were often promised rights that later eroded after independence.  
- Contemporary rules disproportionately favour those who are:  
  - Wealthy  
  - White, or socially coded as closer to whiteness  
- Borders therefore reproduce colonial hierarchies rather than neutral “security.”  

---

## Scarcity as Narrative Control  
- Rhetoric claims “there isn’t room here.”  
- Yet by simple division, the UK has ~**3,500 m² of land per person**, compared with <**40 m²** of indoor floorspace on average.  
- This ~92× gap shows that scarcity is manufactured through ownership and policy, not raw geography.  
- **Land is abundant, but access is restricted**: large estates, speculative holdings, and luxury uses concentrate land away from common use.  

---

## Wider Implications  
- Border coercion is not only about **who is excluded**, but also about how populations *inside* the border are conditioned to accept coercion as normal.  
- Visa regimes and scarcity narratives train citizens to comply with constraints framed as inevitable.  
- Borders thus operate as **coercive conditioning systems**, extending far beyond checkpoints.  

---

## Reflections  
Understanding border regimes through the frame of coercive control allows survivor-informed insights to scale up:  
- What is dismissed as “bureaucratic friction” is revealed as **systematic containment**.  
- Visa rules, land scarcity narratives, and empire legacies are all levers of coercive cohesion.  
- Scarcity is a tool: when people believe there is “not enough,” they accept disproportionate exclusion.

*Coercive Control in Border Policy* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how coercion at the border is systemic, combining surveillance, visa leverage, scarcity narratives, and colonial hierarchies to normalise constraint.

*Shifting definitions of “legal” vs “illegal” migration mirror coercive control*

## Core Idea  
- Domestic law: coercive control (Serious Crime Act 2015).  
- Pattern: impossible rules, moving goalposts, punishment for failure.  
- Border policy = same structure applied to whole populations.  

---

## Mechanisms  
- **Moving goalposts:** past routes closed, new ones nationality-specific.  
- **Punishment:** irregular arrivals criminalised despite no legal alternative.  
- **Dependency:** asylum seekers barred from work, reliant on £49/wk, isolated in hotels.  

---

## Why This Matters  
- If a partner acted this way → crime.  
- When the state does it → “policy.”  
- Naming it exposes abuse structure.
