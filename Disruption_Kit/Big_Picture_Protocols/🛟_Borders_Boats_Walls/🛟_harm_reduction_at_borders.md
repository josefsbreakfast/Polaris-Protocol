*Practical and policy measures to cut deaths and exploitation at points of entry, without waiting for full reform.*

## 🌐 Summary  
Harm reduction starts with a truth: people will cross borders when safer routes are blocked. The choice is not *migration vs no migration* — it is *safe vs unsafe crossings*. This node adapts public-health harm reduction (naloxone, safe-use rooms) to border governance: prioritising **fewer deaths, fewer injuries, less exploitation** over deterrence theatre.

## 🚑 Measures at Point of Entry  

- **Safe reception points:** water, heat, triage, safeguarding checks.  
- **Immediate legal orientation:** multilingual leaflets + QR to trusted legal aid.  
- **Family tracing & safeguarding flags:** prevent forced separations.  
- **Medical & psychological first aid:** trauma-informed care with referral routes.  
- **Data minimisation at intake:** gather only what’s needed for care; defer interviews.  
- **NGO–state coordination cell:** daily stand-up; transparent task board.  
- **Incident transparency:** publish anonymised weekly stats (arrivals, minors, med referrals).

## ⚖️ Policy Practices of Harm Reduction  

1. **Search and Rescue (SAR):** fund rescue explicitly; stop “deterrence by neglect.”  
2. **Asylum access in transit states:** accept claims at UK-linked hubs to reduce boat journeys.  
3. **Rapid paperwork & screening:** cut backlogs; identify threats lawfully and quickly.  
4. **Safe humanitarian visas:** regulated pathways reduce smuggler control.  
5. **Health over carceral models:** psychosocial support, safe housing, not detention.

## 🌋 Why This Reduces Harm  

- Cuts shock/exposure → fewer ICU admissions, fewer deaths.  
- Shrinks exploitation gap exploited by traffickers.  
- Improves quality of evidence for asylum decisions.  
- Flips logic: if risk exists, meet it with care not punishment.

## ❓ Counterarguments & Rebuttals  

- **“Pull factor” myth:** Harm reduction doesn’t increase crossings — same as drug harm reduction doesn’t increase use.  
- **“Criminals will exploit it”**: rapid screening already identifies threats. Punishing everyone else just increases harm.
