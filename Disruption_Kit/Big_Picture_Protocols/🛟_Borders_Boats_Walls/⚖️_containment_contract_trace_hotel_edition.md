# ⚖️ Containment Contract Trace: Hotel Edition  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-28  
*Mapping the corporations profiting from asylum accommodation, detention, and border enforcement*  

---

## 🌌 Core Idea  
- Behind the asylum backlog is a roster of contractors who convert containment into guaranteed revenue.  
- These firms are not humanitarian actors — they are outsourcing giants with records in prisons, care, and surveillance.  
- Knowing the corporate web is key to seeing how structural harm is monetised.

## 🏢 Major Contractors  

### 🐙 **Serco Group**  
- Runs detention centres, asylum accommodation, prisoner escorting.  
- Also manages prisons, probation, NHS contracts, defence.  
- Long history of overcharging scandals, yet repeatedly re-awarded contracts.  
> **Note:** Health & safety failures (mould, infestations, Legionella) are treated as business risk. Decisions are made on cost-benefit, not duty of care. Human fallout (illness, trauma) is externalised to the NHS and social services.  

### 🏚️ **Mears Group**  
- Large provider of asylum accommodation since 2019.  
- Profits surged from Home Office contracts.  
- Also runs housing maintenance, care contracts.  
> **Note:** Health & safety failures are costed, not prevented. Long-term damage is absorbed outside company accounts.  

### 🏨 **Clearsprings Ready Homes**  
- Major player in hotel and dispersal accommodation.  
- Owner **Graham King** has taken multi-million dividends.  
- Repeatedly criticised for substandard housing conditions.  
> **Note:** Treats hazards as business risk; remediation only if cheaper than penalties.  

### 🛡️ **G4S / Allied Universal**  
- Security giant, previously ran detention centres (Brook House, Yarl’s Wood).  
- Still involved in security logistics, deportations, global private prisons.  
- Rebranded under Allied Universal but retains UK government ties.  
> **Note:** Externalises reputational costs; systemic abuse recorded at detention sites absorbed as operational risk.  

### 📡 **Capita (via Tascor)**  
- Ran detainee escorting/removals.  
- Also enforces BBC TV licensing contracts — showing reach across public enforcement.  
- Known for harsh, cutthroat practices and stretching rules to the limit.  
> **Note:** Coercive practices normalised; health and trauma treated as irrelevant to contract metrics.

## 💰 How They Profit  

1. **Guaranteed Income**  
   - Contracts are block-paid regardless of service quality.  
   - Hotel beds are filled; costs are billed daily.  

2. **Minimal Standards**  
   - Reports of infestations, mould, Legionella — yet contracts persist.  
   - Poor quality = lower costs, higher profit margins.  

3. **Portfolio Spread**  
   - Same firms profit across prisons, care homes, probation, asylum.  
   - Containment is their business model, whatever the sector.  

---

## 🚨 Why This Matters  
- These firms benefit from delay and dysfunction — quick asylum decisions would cut their revenue.  
- Political focus on “stopping the boats” ensures demand for their services remains.  
- Public money flows upward; trauma is the by-product.  

---

## 🛑 Counterarguments & Rebuttals  
- “Without them, the system would collapse.” → That is by design: outsourcing has hollowed out public capacity.  
- “Private firms are more efficient.” → Evidence shows repeated failures, abuse, and spiralling costs.
