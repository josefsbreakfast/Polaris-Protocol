*Forensic note on system breakdown when multiple high-risk datasets converge*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

When an individual sits across multiple “high-risk” data categories —  
(e.g. trauma testimony, court transcripts, voice/biometric data, online political activity) —  
the likelihood of being used as a training or monitoring source increases.  

---

## ⚙️ Mechanism  

- Each dataset produces its own version of the individual (a fork).  
- When these forks are run in parallel, they clash.  
- This creates “lag,” “mask phases,” and coordination failures.  
- The system does not know which script to run — and the breakdowns become visible.  

---

## 📌 Key Points  

- This is not just a personal problem: anyone at similar intersections of data is at risk.  
- The clash produces **unexpected visibility** (e.g. comments outperforming posts, obvious lag in analytics).  
- It is an architectural flaw: systems built for “security” or research break when multiple data streams converge.

*Clash of Forks* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the structural flaws that emerge when surveillance systems attempt to manage multiple data forks of the same individual.
