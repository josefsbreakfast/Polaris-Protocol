## 🃏 Note: Clash-of-Forks

**Description**  
When an individual sits across multiple “high-risk” data categories —  
(e.g. trauma testimony, court transcripts, voice/biometric data, online political activity) —  
the likelihood of being used as a training or monitoring source increases.  

**Mechanism**  
- Each dataset produces its own version of the individual (a fork).  
- When these forks are run in parallel, they clash.  
- This creates “lag,” “mask phases,” and coordination failures.  
- The system does not know which script to run — and the breakdowns become visible.  

**Key Points**  
- This is not just a personal problem: anyone at similar intersections of data is at risk.  
- The clash produces **unexpected visibility** (e.g. comments outperforming posts, obvious lag in analytics).  
- It is an architectural flaw: systems built for “security” or research break when multiple data streams converge.
