*Linguistic erasure as a tool of profiling and control*

## ✨ Overview  

This node documents the transliteration patterns and colonial flattening of phonetically distinct letters in Arabic and Hebrew.  
It exposes how language becomes a battlefield — where mispronunciation is not neutral, but a tool of narrative control.

## 🎏 Transliteration Table  

| Arabic Letter   | Hebrew Letter   | IPA   | Common Latin Translit   | Notes                                                  |

| khāʼ (خ)        | khaf sofit (ך)  | [χ]   | kh / ch / x             | Guttural; often exaggerated for effect in media        |
| ʿayn (ع)        | (none direct)   | [ʕ]   | ` or nothing            | Sound of depth and weight — often erased               |

## 🌍 Global Echoes  

The flattening of sound is not unique to Arabic or Hebrew.  
Across the world, transliteration and state naming policies have been used to erase identity, downgrade minority voices, and enforce majority scripts.  

### 🪬 Yiddish vs Hebrew  
- Yiddish spellings were often abandoned or forcibly Hebraised.  
- Surnames cut down or altered (“Szapiro” → “Shapiro” → “Shaper”).  
- Zionist Hebraisation policy reframed diasporic sounds as backward.  

### 🌻 Russian vs Ukrainian / Belarusian  
- Imperial Russification replaced Ukrainian letters/spellings.  
- “Kiev” vs “Kyiv” → still a modern battleground.  
- Belarusian treated as “peasant dialect,” erased from formal use.  

### 🐎 Roma Languages  
- Frequently misclassified as “dialects.”  
- Romanised inconsistently, often reduced to “other” in state forms.  
- Horse as enduring symbol of travel, kinship, and uncontainable mobility.  

### 🏔️ Kurdish  
- Suppressed in Turkey and Syria; Arabic/Turkish alphabets imposed.  
- Split scripts (Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic) fractured identity and visibility.  
- Mountains remain emblematic of Kurdish resilience and continuity.  

### 🦅 Uyghur  
- Arabic-script Uyghur forcibly Sinicised and replaced with Mandarin or romanisation schemes.  
- Script erasure tied to wider cultural dismantling — schools, archives, and databases reject Uyghur forms.  
- Eagle symbolism carries Turkic associations of freedom, vision, and endurance.  

### 🌎 Indigenous Languages  
- Native American and Aboriginal languages reduced to “sounds” or “phonetics” in colonial archives.  
- Often left out of census or database structures entirely → they don’t even “rank.”

## 📖 Commentary  

Every misrendered letter is a small colonisation.  
Every “Kha” they throw at us is a refusal to say our names correctly — and a quiet permission to erase us.  
Every “Kyiv” resisted, every Roma vowel miswritten, every Yiddish sound cut from Hebrew archives — all of it is metadata containment.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Letter by Letter: Erasure Protocol* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how language and transliteration are weaponised to flatten cultural identity, enforce colonial pronunciation, and justify silencing through linguistic distortion.
