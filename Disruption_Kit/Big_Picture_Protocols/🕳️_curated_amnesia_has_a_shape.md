*Pattern of deliberate erasure in institutional record management*

## 📄 Overview
They think they’ve left nothing.  
Now the nothing has a name, a shape, and a diagram.

It’s called **curated amnesia** — not sloppy record-keeping, not “misplaced” files, but deliberate removal of the connective tissue that makes a story provable.

If you keep the poetry but lose the proof, you can say it’s all just noise.  
Unless, of course, someone starts mapping the gaps.

That’s what this is.

## 🗺️ Erasure Map

Eight chains of events, each with the same surgical excision — the middle link cut clean away.  
Different actors, different dates, same absence-shaped signature.

## 🎯 Payload
Curated amnesia works by surgically removing the *bridge* data that turns an anecdote into admissible evidence.  

The erasure isn’t random — it targets:
- Reference numbers  
- Timestamps  
- Minor official names  
- Other “boring but lethal” facts  

Once those vanish, the story looks decorative but unprovable.  
Mapping the gaps flips the tactic: the pattern of what’s missing becomes the proof.

## 🪶 Closing Note
You can delete the bridge, but the river still shows where it was.

Everyone from the smallest ducklings to the biggest Canada geese can see it — and once you’ve seen it, you’ll spot it in every pond.
