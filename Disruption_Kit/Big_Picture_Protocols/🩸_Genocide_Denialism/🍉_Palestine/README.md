# 🍉 Palestine  
**First created:** 2025-10-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-08  
*Analytical and testimonial cluster tracing mechanisms of genocide denialism in Palestine, and the systemic suppression of its documentation.*

---

## ✨ Orientation  

This folder holds nodes examining how denial, deflection, and erasure operate around the genocide of Palestinians — across media, governance, academia, and digital infrastructure.  
It functions as both forensic archive and refusal register: a living record of suppression mechanisms and survivor-aligned counter-analysis.  

Each node connects material evidence (dataset, log, or case) with its surrounding discourse — the propaganda loops, bureaucratic evasions, and algorithmic throttling that shape what the world is “allowed” to see.

## 🛰 Key Features  

- **Denialism Typologies** — how state, media, and institutional narratives neutralise or invert witness accounts.  
- **Visibility Control Maps** — platform throttling, content moderation asymmetry, and algorithmic disappearance.  
- **Counter-Records** — testimony, imagery, and analytical nodes preserving erased or distorted histories.  
- **Forensic Correlation** — links between public-facing censorship and private-sector data suppression.  
- **Memory Resistance** — linguistic, artistic, and archival practices maintaining truth under active containment.
