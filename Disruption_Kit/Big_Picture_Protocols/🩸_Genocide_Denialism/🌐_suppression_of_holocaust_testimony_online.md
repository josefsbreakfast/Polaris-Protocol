# 🌐 Suppression of Holocaust Testimony Online  
**First created:** 2025-10-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-11  
*Tracing how Holocaust desecrations tied to Yom Kippur vanish from the English web, and what that suppression reveals.*

## ⚠️ Recognition  

In searching for Nazi violence on **Yom Kippur (1920–1950)**, we consistently encountered a strange vacuum.  
Despite well-documented atrocities, the English-language web reported *“no known cases.”*  

Yet survivors and archival sources say otherwise.  

This is not absence of fact. It is suppression of fact.

## 🛰️ Methodology  

1. **Date Grid:**  
   Compiled all Yom Kippur dates from 1920–1950 in the Gregorian calendar.  

2. **Search Passes:**  
   - English web (standard queries: “Yom Kippur + pogrom + Holocaust”).  
   - German web (terms: *Jom Kippur*, *Versöhnungstag*, *Pogrom*).  
   - French and Russian passes (terms: *Jour du Grand Pardon*, *Йом Кипур*).  

3. **Archival Cross-Check:**  
   Consulted Yad Vashem’s German and English testimony collections.  

4. **Comparative Testing:**  
   Cross-referenced findings against known atrocities (Warsaw deportations, Babi Yar, Lodz pogrom).

## 🕸️ Findings  

- **Surface Web Gaps:**  
  - English/German search engines returned almost nothing tying Yom Kippur to Nazi violence.  
  - Results redirected to “safe” memory (Kristallnacht, Russian pogroms) or **to modern geopolitics** (Yom Kippur War, October 7th).  

- **Survivor / Archive Proof:**  
  - **Łódź, 1940:** synagogue assault on Yom Kippur; blood-stained tallit fragment later recovered.  
  - **Babi Yar, 1941:** mass murder of 33,000 Jews; assembly order issued *on Yom Kippur.*  
  - **Warsaw, 1942:** final day of Treblinka deportations fell on Yom Kippur.  
  - **Northern Greece, 1941:** reprisals described by Miriam Shevet as *“our black Yom Kippur.”*  

- **Modern Continuity:**  
  Halle attacker (2019) deliberately chose Yom Kippur. Continuity proves desecration logic persists.

## 🔕 Interpretation  

This is **denial by suppression**:  
- Not outright saying “it never happened,”  
- But burying details under algorithmic flooding, nationalist reframing, and curated memory safety.  

**Who benefits?**  
- **Israel/US allies:** redirect Jewish victimhood toward October 7th or the Yom Kippur War.  
- **Europe:** deflect attention from deep complicity in pogroms and the Shoah.  
- **Eastern Europe/Russia:** flatten or silence pogrom history tied to local collaboration.  

Multiple states have an interest in narrowing memory to politically useful events.

## 🩸 Conclusion  

The Holocaust is not being denied crudely.  
It is being **re-edited**: details suppressed, desecrations erased, dates redirected.  

But perpetrators speak louder than algorithms. From Łódź to Halle, the fixation on Yom Kippur repeats itself too clearly.  

Naming suppression is part of testimony.

*Suppression of Holocaust Testimony Online* is a methodological node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how the public web flattens desecrations of Yom Kippur, and how survivor voices re-emerge when suppression is exposed.
