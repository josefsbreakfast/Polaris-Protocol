# 📜 Charity Regime Reform

*Policy design for transitional legislation toward democratic mutual aid.*
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15

## 🎯 Executive intent

A short, lawful bridge from today’s charity model to a future where communities govern their own mutual aid — with safeguards, transparency, and zero tolerance for paternalism.

---

## 🧩 Problem statement

* Fragmented funding ecosystems entrench gatekeeper power and delay relief.
* Compliance theatre consumes capacity while obscuring outcomes.
* Donor control skews priorities away from community-defined need.
* Mutual aid groups do the work but lack legal standing, risk cover, or stable finance.

**Transitional law** should: (1) legitimise mutual aid entities, (2) redirect a predictable share of charitable flows to democratic vehicles, (3) set minimum transparency + consent standards, and (4) sunset legacy provisions that reward gatekeeping.

## 🧭 Design principles (Survivor Voice Fidelity)

1. **Dignity first:** no policy may condition help on disclosure that violates privacy or agency.
2. **Proximity is expertise:** resident-led boards hold decisive power on allocations.
3. **Visibility is a right:** public, machine-readable ledgers of commitments, not just spend.
4. **No containment by paperwork:** proportional compliance; lightweight by default, heavier only where risk is proven.
5. **Consent travels:** data, stories, and testimony cannot be reused beyond the original purpose without renewed consent.
6. **Redress exists:** communities can trigger an independent review that can freeze flows and mandate corrective repair.

## 🏗️ Core legislative package (draft scaffolding)

### Part A — Definitions & scope

* Establish a new legal form: **Democratic Mutual Aid Organisation (DMAO)**.
* Define *community*, *member*, *resident-led*, *participatory grantmaking*, *open ledger*.

### Part B — Registration & governance

* Minimum: 60% resident-director quorum; conflict-of-interest registry; rotation rules.
* **Participatory Budget Assembly (PBA):** annual open process for priorities; binding for DMAO boards.
* Lightweight filing: 10-page annual narrative + open ledger export.

### Part C — Funding streams (revectoring flows)

* **Earmarked Reallocation:** x% of tax-relieved donations and x% of public grants must be pass-through to DMAOs or DMAO consortia.
* **Automatic Gift Aid pass-through:** Relief follows the donation into DMAO accounts without extra application.
* **Counter-cyclical Stabiliser:** Treasury match during declared local emergencies (triggered by councils or PBAs).

### Part D — Transparency & consent

* Mandatory **Open Commitment Ledger (OCL):** planned allocations published before spend; updates timestamped; API access.
* **Testimony protection clause:** stories/testimony classified as *sensitive narrative data*; reuse requires explicit renewal.

### Part E — Safeguards & redress

* **Community Ombuds Node (CON):** pooled independent reviewers drawn from accredited panels; powers: information requests, temporary flow freezes, corrective directives.
* **No Retaliation rule:** whistleblowers protected across employers, landlords, and service providers.
* **Survivor Sovereignty line:** beneficiaries may refuse branding, photography, or intrusive monitoring without penalty.

### Part F — Sunset & migration

* Sunset obsolete *grant-to-grant* pass-throughs that add no value.
* Convert qualifying legacy charities into DMAOs via a simplified vote + asset lock migration.

## 🧪 Pilot architecture (12–18 months)

* **Local pilots:** 6 sites (urban/rural mix), each with a DMAO + PBA.
* **Evaluation frame:** time-to-aid, resident satisfaction, redress use, admin cost ratio, participation equity.
* **Data:** open by default; privacy budgets for sensitive narrative data.

---

## 💷 Fiscal + incentives sketch

* Neutral-to-positive expected over 3 years via lower admin overheads and misallocation reduction.
* Relief integrity preserved: Gift Aid + corporate reliefs continue but bind to OCL transparency.

---

## 📊 Metrics & verification

* **Speed:** median days from pledge → disbursement.
* **Reach:** % of funds to first- and second-quintile need areas.
* **Governance health:** quorum attainment, rotation compliance, conflict registry completeness.
* **Redress:** rate of issues raised, time to resolution, remedy adequacy index.
* **Visibility:** ledger completeness score (commitment-level, project-level, vendor-level).

---

## ⚠️ Risk register (with countermeasures)

* **Capture by local elites →** residency quorum + rotation + ombuds scrutiny.
* **Paperwork creep →** statutory page limits + API exports substitute duplicative reports.
* **Data harms →** testimony protection clause + consent renewal.
* **Token PBAs →** make PBA outcomes binding on DMAO budgets.

---

## 🗣️ Comms & legitimacy

* Narrative shift from *charity for* to **solidarity with**.
* Publish side-by-side dashboards contrasting admin load and time-to-aid pre/post DMAO.

---

## 🗺️ Implementation timeline (indicative)

* Month 0–3: green paper; consult; select pilot sites.
* Month 4–6: bill intro; create registry + ombuds panels.
* Month 7–18: pilots; quarterly dashboards; midline review at month 12.
* Month 18+: national rollout gates tied to metrics.
