# 📜 Charity Regime Reform  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Policy design for transitional legislation toward democratic mutual aid.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

A short, lawful bridge from today’s charity model to a future where communities govern their own mutual aid — with safeguards, transparency, and zero tolerance for paternalism.

---

## ✨ Problem Statement  

* Fragmented funding ecosystems entrench gatekeeper power and delay relief.  
* Compliance theatre consumes capacity while obscuring outcomes.  
* Donor control skews priorities away from community-defined need.  
* Mutual aid groups do the work but lack legal standing, risk cover, or stable finance.  

**Transitional law** should:  
1. Legitimise mutual aid entities.  
2. Redirect a predictable share of charitable flows to democratic vehicles.  
3. Set minimum transparency + consent standards.  
4. Sunset legacy provisions that reward gatekeeping.

---

## 🧭 Design Principles  

1. **Dignity first:** no policy may condition help on disclosure that violates privacy or agency.  
2. **Proximity is expertise:** resident-led boards hold decisive power on allocations.  
3. **Visibility is a right:** public, machine-readable ledgers of commitments, not just spend.  
4. **No containment by paperwork:** proportional compliance; lightweight by default, heavier only where risk is proven.  
5. **Consent travels:** data, stories, and testimony cannot be reused beyond the original purpose without renewed consent.  
6. **Redress exists:** communities can trigger an independent review that can freeze flows and mandate corrective repair.

## 🏗️ Core Legislative Package  

### Part A — Definitions & Scope  
* Establish a new legal form: **Democratic Mutual Aid Organisation (DMAO)**.  
* Define *community*, *member*, *resident-led*, *participatory grantmaking*, *open ledger*.  

### Part B — Registration & Governance  
* Minimum: 60% resident-director quorum; conflict-of-interest registry; rotation rules.  
* **Participatory Budget Assembly (PBA):** annual open process for priorities; binding for DMAO boards.  
* Lightweight filing: 10-page annual narrative + open ledger export.  

### Part C — Funding Streams  
* **Earmarked Reallocation:** x% of tax-relieved donations and x% of public grants must be pass-through to DMAOs or DMAO consortia.  
* **Automatic Gift Aid pass-through:** relief follows the donation into DMAO accounts without extra application.  
* **Counter-cyclical Stabiliser:** Treasury match during declared local emergencies (triggered by councils or PBAs).  

### Part D — Transparency & Consent  
* Mandatory **Open Commitment Ledger (OCL):** planned allocations published before spend; updates timestamped; API access.  
* **Testimony Protection Clause:** stories/testimony classified as *sensitive narrative data*; reuse requires explicit renewal.  

### Part E — Safeguards & Redress  
* **Community Ombuds Node (CON):** pooled independent reviewers drawn from accredited panels; powers: information requests, temporary flow freezes, corrective directives.  
* **No Retaliation Rule:** whistleblowers protected across employers, landlords, and service providers.  
* **Survivor Sovereignty Line:** beneficiaries may refuse branding, photography, or intrusive monitoring without penalty.  

### Part F — Sunset & Migration  
* Sunset obsolete *grant-to-grant* pass-throughs that add no value.  
* Convert qualifying legacy charities into DMAOs via a simplified vote + asset lock migration.

## 🧪 Pilot Architecture (12–18 Months)  

* **Local pilots:** six sites (urban/rural mix), each with a DMAO + PBA.  
* **Evaluation frame:** time-to-aid, resident satisfaction, redress use, admin cost ratio, participation equity.  
* **Data:** open by default; privacy budgets for sensitive narrative data.

---

## 💷 Fiscal + Incentives Sketch  

* Neutral-to-positive expected over 3 years via lower admin overheads and misallocation reduction.  
* Relief integrity preserved: Gift Aid + corporate reliefs continue but bind to OCL transparency.

---

## 📊 Metrics & Verification  

* **Speed:** median days from pledge → disbursement.  
* **Reach:** % of funds to first- and second-quintile need areas.  
* **Governance health:** quorum attainment, rotation compliance, conflict registry completeness.  
* **Redress:** rate of issues raised, time to resolution, remedy adequacy index.  
* **Visibility:** ledger completeness score (commitment-level, project-level, vendor-level).

## ⚠️ Risk Register (With Countermeasures)  

| Risk | Countermeasure |
|------|----------------|
| Capture by local elites | Residency quorum + rotation + ombuds scrutiny |
| Paperwork creep | Statutory page limits + API exports substitute duplicative reports |
| Data harms | Testimony protection clause + consent renewal |
| Token PBAs | Make PBA outcomes binding on DMAO budgets |

---

## 🗣️ Comms & Legitimacy  

* Narrative shift from *charity for* to **solidarity with**.  
* Publish side-by-side dashboards contrasting admin load and time-to-aid pre/post DMAO.

---

## 🗺️ Implementation Timeline (Indicative)  

* **Month 0–3:** green paper; consult; select pilot sites.  
* **Month 4–6:** bill intro; create registry + ombuds panels.  
* **Month 7–18:** pilots; quarterly dashboards; midline review at month 12.  
* **Month 18+:** national rollout gates tied to metrics.
