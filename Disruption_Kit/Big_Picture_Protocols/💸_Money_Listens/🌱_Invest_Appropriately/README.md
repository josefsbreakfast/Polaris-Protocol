## 🌐 Overview
This folder examines how Britain’s charity system — and the broader Western model of “philanthropic democracy” — has transformed from moral infrastructure into a mechanism of control.  
It includes both structural analysis and remedy design for rebalancing civic power.

**Core Threads**
- Charity and soft power as instruments of state retreat  
- The “deserving poor” archetype and moral economy  
- Religious rhetoric vs economic practice  
- Mutual aid, community vehicles, and democratic redesign
