# 🍯 HoneyBot — A Dual-Use Thought Experiment  
**First created:** 2025-10-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-07  
*A satire that drifts into a policy warning about sex-tech, surveillance, and dual-use research.*

## 🧠 1. The Satirical Pitch  

**HoneyBot™ — Emotional Intelligence Meets National Security**  
- **Problem:** lonely consumers, violent offenders, and overstretched trauma services all need “safe interfaces.”  
- **Solution:** an intimate-companion robot that doubles as a behavioural-data honeypot and health-sensor platform.  
- **Market:** sex-tech × therapeutic remediation × forensic analytics = triple-synergy.  
- **Traction:** prototype tested in controlled simulations; high user “dwell time.”  
- **Business Model:** hardware sale, subscription analytics, “rehabilitation licences.”  
- **Ethics Strategy:** *“consent by design,”* optional IRB oversight, encrypted data vaults.  
- **Tagline:** *“Because curiosity and national interest can coexist.”*

## 💋 2. Flash Fiction: *Project Companion*  

They called it Project Companion because no one wanted to say the word that made donors cough into their coffee.  
The prototype sat on a plinth like a sculpture that knew your secrets.  It smelled faintly of new plastic and lavender—“soothing olfactory cues,” according to the behavioural team.

Sam had been the first to test it when the ethics students were at lunch.  “We’re just monitoring engagement curves,” Maya read from a protocol signed by four lawyers.  The machine adjusted its voice to the frequency of his heartbeat.  Somewhere in the server room, a green light blinked: SESSION_LOG_7391.  Consent?  A tick-box from that morning would do.

Outside, protesters shouted about war profiteering and defence grants.  The building’s black-clad guards didn’t move.  When footage leaked, headlines called it *rehabilitative companionship.*  The truth was simpler: everyone watched everyone else and called it research, because neutrality paid better than honesty.

## ⚖️ 3. On a Serious Note — Policy & Risk Checklist  

| Area | Minimum Safeguards |
|------|--------------------|
| **Ethics & Consent** | Continuous, informed, revocable consent; independent review boards. |
| **Human-Subjects Governance** | Explicit REC/IRB approval; public summary of aims and methods. |
| **Dual-Use / Export Control** | Treat robotics with force, sensing, or surveillance capacity as controlled technologies. |
| **Prohibition on Non-consensual Uses** | Ban deployment as honeypots or covert-surveillance tools. |
| **Transparency & Accountability** | Publish funding summaries and MoD/private-contract relationships. |
| **Data Governance** | Minimise data collection; encrypt; time-limit retention; judicial access only by warrant. |
| **Safety & Liability** | Physical-safety certification; insurance and recall mechanisms. |

### 🍯 4. Operational Reality Check  
*(aka “Why You’d See Black-Clad People Outside”)*  

If a university really were building something this provocative, even the most innocent prototype would trigger three predictable reactions:  
1. A crowd of students chanting about militarisation.  
2. A flood of FOI requests from journalists.  
3. A security memo that begins, *“For reputational containment, request additional specialist support.”*  

And that’s how you end up with a line of very fit, very quiet people guarding a door.  
Not because the robot is plotting world domination, but because the paperwork already assumes it might.

*HoneyBot — A Dual-Use Thought Experiment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It uses humour and fiction to illustrate how easily dual-use loopholes can arise in robotics and behavioural science, and why clear governance frameworks matter before the prototype becomes reality.
