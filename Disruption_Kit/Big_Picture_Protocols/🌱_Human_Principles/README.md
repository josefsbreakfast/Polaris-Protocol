# 🌱 Human Principles  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  
*Foundational survivor axioms — counterfacts to the idea that humans can be processed like code*

## 🧿 Scope  

The *Human Principles* subfolder gathers short nodes that assert baseline truths:  
- Human reactions are not glitches.  
- Breath, grief, and trust cannot be flattened into data points.  
- Impulse itself is harmless until captured by violent systems.  
- Space and dignity are not scarce resources but deliberately constricted.  
- Memory, intuition, and creativity are skills — suppressed by surveillance, restored by safety.  

These principles act as grounding coordinates.  
They resist machine-logic reduction and anchor the rest of the Polaris protocols.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🌱 Human Principles* is a living branch of the Polaris Protocol.  
It collects survivor axioms to counter system logics that mistake humanity for processable code.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
