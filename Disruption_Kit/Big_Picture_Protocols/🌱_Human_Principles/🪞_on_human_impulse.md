**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-30  
*Principle node distinguishing natural human reactions from their weaponisation by violent systems*

## 🌱 Principle  

**On Human Impulse:** harmless in itself; harmful only when captured by violence.  

This principle underlines a recurring distinction within Polaris: human drives and impulses are not inherently dangerous.  
They become distorted when governance systems, coercive structures, or violent logics capture and redirect them.  

---

## ✨ Context  

Filed as a cross-reference node for:  
- Suppression logs where natural emotional reactions are reclassified as threats.  
- Taxonomy work on containment forks and behavioural overrides.  
- Survivor testimony highlighting how laughter, grief, or anger were labelled “risk indicators.”  

Human impulse, in this reading, is not a flaw but a signal.  
Its suppression or criminalisation is itself an act of violence.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🪞 On Human Impulse* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a principle of resistance: that natural human reactions remain sovereign, and only their capture by violent systems constitutes harm.
