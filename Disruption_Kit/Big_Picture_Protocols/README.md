- **Trauma/Medical Misuse** and **Witness Casefiles** ground analysis in survivor evidence.  
- **Politics & Memory Work** connects to **Radicalisation & Extremism** through identity formation and suppression.  
- **Coercive Nudges** act as the interface between bureaucratic policy and behavioural impact.
