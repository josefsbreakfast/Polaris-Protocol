# 🧠 Big Picture Protocols  
**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Big ideas to defeat the small ideologies.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  
**Big Picture Protocols** map the structural layers of behavioural governance.  
Each cluster examines **memory control, coercive systems, radicalisation pipelines, and institutional nudging** at scale.  
These entries interlink with **Containment Scripts**, **Survivor Tools**, and **Field Logs** for full forensic mapping.

## 🫐 Current Subclusters  

### [✨ Glimmer Is Taxable And Other Big Drums](./✨_Glimmer_Is_Taxable_And_Other_Big_Drums)  
Ethics of influence, symbolic economies, and moral accounting — where glimmer meets governance.  

### [🌀 System Governance](./🌀_System_Governance)  
The architectures of control: laws, ownership, containment logic, and state–corporate interlocks.  

### [🐍 Ouroborotic Violence](./🐍_Ouroborotic_Violence)  
Recursive architectures of harm — how violence consumes and reproduces itself.  

### [🦕 Elder Influencers](./🦕_Elder_Influencers)  
Old powers in new clothes. From money and statutes to world webs and borders, this cluster maps how legacy elites perpetuate influence.  

### [🪄 Expression Of Norms](./🪄_Expression_Of_Norms)  
Media, academia, and bureaucratic culture as engines of norm enforcement. Tracks compliance theatre and behavioural nudging.  

### [🫀 Our Hearts Our Minds](./🫀_Our_Hearts_Our_Minds)  
Cluster on care, harm, and belief — where trauma, psychology, and safeguarding intersect with humane governance.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  

- **Glimmer Is Taxable** explores the ethics and aesthetics of moral authority.  
- **System Governance** provides the infrastructural frameworks underpinning all other clusters.  
- **Ouroborotic Violence** analyses recursive containment — the self-devouring logic of control.  
- **Elder Influencers** traces financial, legal, and territorial continuities of power.  
- **Expression Of Norms** exposes how social order is performed and policed through institutions.  
- **Our Hearts Our Minds** grounds the entire framework in embodied ethics, trauma, and witness.

*🧠 Big Picture Protocols* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It organises the conceptual architecture through which containment systems are named, mapped, and undone.
