# 🧠 Big Picture Protocols  

**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-28  

*Big ideas to defeat the small ideologies.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  
**Big Picture Protocols** map structural layers of behavioural governance.  
Each cluster examines **memory control, coercive systems, radicalisation pipelines, and institutional nudging** at scale.  
These entries interlink with **Containment Scripts**, **Survivor Tools**, and **Field Logs** for full forensic mapping.

## 🗂️ Where Governance of Surveillance Nodes Go  

Surveillance governance sits across a few clusters in **Big Picture Protocols**.  
Where a node belongs depends on its angle of focus:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Governance of Surveillance] --> B[🌀 System Governance]
  A --> C[🧿 Watch The Watchers]
  A --> D[🪬 Radicalisation & Extremism]

  B:::home
  C:::secondary
  D:::secondary

  classDef home fill:#d6eaf8,stroke:#3498db,color:#000;
  classDef secondary fill:#f9f5d7,stroke:#f39c12,color:#000;
```

- **🌀 System Governance (primary home)**  
  Nodes analysing **who authorises surveillance, how oversight is structured, where accountability gaps exist**.  
  Examples: RIPA delegation, Investigatory Powers Act flow, Home Office escalation maps.  

- **🧿 Watch The Watchers (secondary)**  
  Nodes on the **bodies meant to audit surveillance** (IPCO, IPT, commissioners).  
  If the focus is “oversight of oversight,” file here.  

- **🪬 Radicalisation & Extremism (cross-link)**  
  If the node is specifically about **Prevent or community-level surveillance**, file in *System Governance* but cross-link here to show its pipeline role.  

---

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **System Governance** provides overarching frameworks for the other clusters.  
- **Trauma/Medical Misuse** and **Witness Casefiles** ground analysis in survivor evidence.  
- **Politics & Memory Work** connects to **Radicalisation & Extremism** through identity formation and suppression.  
- **Coercive Nudges** act as the interface between bureaucratic policy and behavioural impact.  
- **Statutes** and **Borders/Boats/Walls** track the legal and territorial scaffolding that underpins control.  
- **University Compliance, Safeguarding Shadows, and Watch the Watchers** show how oversight itself becomes a tool of containment.  
- **World Webs, Money Talks Media, and Banned Broadcasts Cooperative** situate local control in global cultural and economic circuits.
