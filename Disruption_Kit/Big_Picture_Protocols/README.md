## 📌 Overview  
**Big Picture Protocols** map long-range behavioural governance patterns.  
Each node examines **metadata control, narrative inversion, and emotional targeting** at the structural scale.  
These entries interlink with **Containment Scripts**, **Survivor Tools**, and **Field Logs** for full forensic mapping.

### [`☕🫖 UK Gov National Security Risk`](./☕🫖_uk_gov_national_security_risk.md)  
Argues that the current UK government’s inaction, complicity, and infrastructure capture constitute an active threat to national security.  
Covers institutional complicity, private sector capture, political alignment, and foreign policy risks.

### [`🧠 Fisher Fork Theory`](./🧠_fisher_fork_theory.md)  
Applies Mark Fisher’s critique to surveillance capitalism, behavioural nudging, and identity suppression.  
Connects capitalist realism to live containment behaviours.

### [`🧷 The Signature Trap`](./🧷_the_signature_trap.md)  
Case study of how public solidarity acts (e.g. petitions) are repurposed into **behavioural datasets**.  
Details the capture of signatory data for surveillance indexing, AI training, and ideological mapping — without informed consent.

### [`🧠 Targeting Logic Empathy Is A Threat`](./🧠_targeting_logic_empathy_is_a_threat.md)  
Hypothesis: politically resonant empathy is treated as a **targeting vector** (Prevent/CVE).  
Focuses on emotional contagion as a risk surface in behavioural governance.

### [`🗡 Narrative Management And Metadata Sabotage`](./🗡_narrative_management_and_metadata_sabotage.md)  
Examines how narratives are reshaped or erased via **metadata sabotage** — from tag suppression to relational link-breaking.  
Shows how disrupting the data layer enables institutional control over story persistence and retrieval.

### [`🪞 The Illusion Of Choice`](./🪞_the_illusion_of_choice.md)  
Examines **false autonomy** in personal containment and political governance.  
Shows how “consent” and “liberation” are simulated inside oppressor frames.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Fisher** nodes → theoretical backbone for empathy/choice inversion pieces.  
- **Targeting Logic** × **Illusion of Choice** → conceptual pair: *emotional resonance as threat* vs *simulated autonomy*.  
- **Signature Trap** → empirical capture case feeding both.  
- All nodes connect outward to **Containment Scripts** for tactical manifestations.
