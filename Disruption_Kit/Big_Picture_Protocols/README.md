# 🧠 Polaris Protocol – Big Picture Protocols  
**Location:** `Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols`  
_Last updated: 2025-08-13_

---

## 📌 Overview  
**Big Picture Protocols** map long-range behavioural governance patterns.  
Each node examines **metadata control, narrative inversion, and emotional targeting** at the structural scale.  
These entries interlink with **Containment Scripts**, **Survivor Tools**, and **Field Logs** for full forensic mapping.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **Fisher** nodes → theoretical backbone for empathy/choice inversion pieces.  
- **Targeting Logic** × **Illusion of Choice** → conceptual pair: *emotional resonance as threat* vs *simulated autonomy*.  
- **Signature Trap** → empirical capture case feeding both.  
- All nodes connect outward to **Containment Scripts** for tactical manifestations.
