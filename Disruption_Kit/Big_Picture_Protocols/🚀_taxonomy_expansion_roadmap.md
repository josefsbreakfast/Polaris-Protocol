# 🚀 Taxonomy Expansion Roadmap  
**First created:** 2025-09-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  

*A forward plan for extending the Fork Taxonomy into a wider containment-mapping framework.*  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  

The Fork Taxonomy is unique in its **behavioural, narrative-suppression framing**.  
This roadmap outlines how to expand it into a broader framework that can stand alongside mainstream AI risk taxonomies while retaining its survivor-authored edge.  

---

## 🧭 Expansion Axes  

### 1. 🪜 Contextual Risk Layering  
- **Map fork triggers** against broader AI risk domains (e.g., misinformation, disinformation, human-computer interaction).  
- **Crosswalk** with the [AI Risk Repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12622) to situate forks in larger threat contexts.  

### 2. 🧀 Guardrail-Anchored Mapping  
- Use the [Swiss Cheese Model for AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02205) as a mirror structure.  
- Treat forks as **guardrail breaches**; reversal tactics as **patches**.  

### 3. 🗺 Fork Mapping Tools  
- Inspired by [Policy Maps for LLM Behaviour Control](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.18203v2).  
- Build **visual diagnostics** that show:  
  - Which fork is active  
  - How forks drift into specific narrative regions.  

### 4. 🔄 Lifecycle Situating  
- Draw on [NIST-linked Taxonomy of Trustworthiness for AI](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Taxonomy_of_AI_Trustworthiness_tables.pdf).  
- Map fork insertion points across the **AI lifecycle**: design, deployment, operation.  

---

## 🛠 Next Steps  

1. **Cross-mapping table**: Forks × AI Risk domains.  
2. **Guardrail visualisation**: Overlay forks as “holes in the cheese.”  
3. **Interactive prototype**: Quick-reference matrix with live “fork drift” visualisation.  
4. **Lifecycle overlay**: Annotated chart of where forks are most likely to emerge.
