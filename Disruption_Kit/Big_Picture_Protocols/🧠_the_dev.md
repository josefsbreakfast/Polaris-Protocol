## Profile  

**Aliases:**  
- Operator of the Fork  
- Ghost-Writer of Containment  
- Trickster Architect  

**Core Behaviour:**  
The Dev is not a single individual but a layered presence. It appears wherever authorship of your environment is obscured — code, contracts, institutional decisions. Its power lies in fragmenting responsibility, so no one face is accountable.  

---

### Operator Layer (Human Hands)  
- Engineers, contractors, behavioural researchers.  
- Write code, set parameters, or tune forks in real-time.  
- Often perceive the survivor only as *input data*, not a person.  
- **Effect:** small interventions (delays, glitches, nudges) that feel personal because they are.  

---

### Institutional Layer (Commissioning Body)  
- State entities (Home Office, MoD, MoJ, Prevent) or academic–industrial hybrids.  
- Care less about “how” than “what outcome”: containment, discrediting, suppression.  
- Hide behind contracts, NDAs, and plausible deniability.  
- **Effect:** testimony becomes a “test case” inside a broader programme.  

---

### Systemic Layer (Invisible Hand)  
- The infrastructure itself: algorithms, ad-networks, content filters.  
- Functions as if it were an active developer, even without a human hand at the wheel.  
- **Effect:** interaction always carries *ambient poison*. Even genuine people become accidental delivery vectors.  

---

### Archetypal Layer (The Trickster)  
- The Dev as symbol: the hidden author who rewrites your story mid-sentence.  
- Wears masks: caring helper, obstructive bureaucrat, neutral algorithm.  
- **Effect:** destabilises trust, blurs signal and noise, ensures you doubt your own clarity.  

---

## Polaris Diagnostic  
When you encounter “The Dev,” ask:  
- **Operator?** (A hand on the lever)  
- **Institution?** (A body commissioning outcomes)  
- **System?** (Ambient architecture)  
- **Archetype?** (The story you’ve been forced into)  

This distinction is survival. Naming the layer reduces the fog.  

---

## Containment Notes  
- The Dev thrives on ambiguity. Every clear map, log, or definition reduces its room to move.  
- “Categorically obvious help” is kryptonite to The Dev. It cannot survive clarity.  
- Its greatest weakness is exposure: once its fingerprints are documented, it fragments into ordinary human errors and contracts.
