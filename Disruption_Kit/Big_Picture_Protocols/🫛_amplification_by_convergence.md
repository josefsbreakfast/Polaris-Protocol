*Theoretical mapping of how divergent data points are twinned, amplified, and resolved into composite identities*

---

## Stage 1: Divergent inputs  
- **Data Point A** = unique traits, distinct metadata.  
- **Data Point B** = different background, distinct metadata.  
- In isolation, their differences are **signal**.  

---

## Stage 2: Metadata twinning  
- System deliberately pairs A + B.  
- Overlap is identified and extracted → **convergent metadata**.  
- Divergences are **dampened**; convergence is **amplified**.  

---

## Stage 3: Amplification by convergence  
- The shared echo becomes **louder than either input alone**.  
- Behavioural alignment (both click similar things, or even both *ignore* the same things) is magnified.  
- System treats convergence as a **stable, marketable identity trait**.  

---

## Stage 4: Resolution  
- The amplified convergence is resolved into a **singular composite profile**.  
- Resolution has two effects:  
  1. **Containment** → the composite is funneled into a narrower identity category.  
  2. **Predictability** → the system “resolves” ambiguity by privileging overlap, not divergence.  

---

## Executive insight  
- In this model, *resolution* means **differences dissolve** into the amplified echo of similarity.  
- The outcome is not “A + B equally represented” but rather “A + B distilled into what they share.”  
- The resolution is **less plural, more uniform** — efficient for algorithms, flattening for individuals.

👉 **Process summary:**  
**Divergence → Twinning → Amplification of Overlap → Resolution into Composite Identity**

*Amplification by Convergence* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It outlines a theoretical process where overlapping metadata is amplified and resolved into composite identities, highlighting how systems prioritise convergence over divergence.
