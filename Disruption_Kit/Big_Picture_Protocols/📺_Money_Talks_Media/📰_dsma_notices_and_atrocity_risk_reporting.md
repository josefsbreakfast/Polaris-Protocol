# 📰 DSMA Notices & Atrocity-Risk Reporting  
**First created:** 2025-10-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-11  
*When advisory secrecy guidance collides with the duty to report potential mass-atrocity crimes.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node clarifies the status of **Defence and Security Media Advisory (DSMA) Notices** in the United Kingdom and how journalists should interpret them when investigating or reporting events that may constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, or other large-scale harm.  
DSMA Notices are **advisory**, not legally binding, but they signal possible national-security or operational-safety risks.  
The key task is to balance *harm prevention* against *the public’s right to know.*

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Advisory only** — DSMA Notices have no automatic legal force.  
- **Operational-risk flag** — They indicate potential exposure of sensitive defence, intelligence, or humanitarian operations.  
- **Independent decision** — Editors remain responsible for publication; ignoring a DSMA is not, in itself, unlawful.  
- **Ethical tension** — Suppression in atrocity contexts can itself endanger lives by obstructing visibility.

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. DSMA Mechanism (in brief)  
- Issued by the DSMA Committee — a voluntary partnership between government & media.  
- Editors receive general categories (personnel security, operational details, intelligence methods, etc.).  
- Journalists may contact the Secretary of the DSMA Committee for informal, confidential advice.  
- Compliance is conventional, not statutory.

### 2. Law vs Convention  
- **DSMA ≠ legal prohibition.** Publication is not a crime purely because a DSMA exists.  
- Legal exposure arises only from other instruments — Official Secrets Act 1989, contempt, injunctions, data-protection, etc.  
- Therefore, each case requires a separate legal and ethical test.

### 3. Atrocity-Risk Context  
When credible risk of genocide or mass violence exists:  
1. **Assess immediate harm:** Could publication endanger civilians, witnesses, or humanitarian operations?  
2. **Weigh public interest:** Could exposure accelerate protective or diplomatic intervention?  
3. **Record reasoning:** Document both analyses before deciding.  
4. **Seek legal + ethical review:** internal counsel / editor-in-chief / humanitarian liaison.  

### 4. Decision Matrix  

| Dimension | Low Risk | High Risk | Recommended Action |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|
| National security impact | Routine political disclosure | Reveals current operations / locations | Seek DSMA guidance; redact details |
| Human safety impact | None | May expose victims / defenders | Anonymise; coordinate with NGOs |
| Evidentiary value | Minor | Critical to atrocity verification | Publish with risk-mitigation note |
| Legal exposure | None | Under Official Secrets Act / injunction | Obtain legal review |

## 🧰 Practical Checklist  
- Verify facts and timestamps.  
- Remove identifiers endangering victims or witnesses.  
- Keep a written **harms matrix** with mitigation steps.  
- If engaging DSMA, preserve the correspondence.  
- If publishing against DSMA advice, document the **public-interest justification** and approvals chain.

Standing against authoritarianism and against potential misuse of British legal systems is the *height* of patriotism, actually.
