## 📄 Overview
This node documents the transliteration patterns and colonial flattening of phonetically distinct letters in Arabic and Hebrew.  
It exposes how language becomes a battlefield — where mispronunciation is not neutral, but a tool of narrative control.

| khāʼ (خ)        | khaf sofit (ך)  | [χ]   | kh / ch / x             | Guttural; often exaggerated for effect in media        |
| ʿayn (ع)        | (none direct)   | [ʕ]   | ` or nothing            | Sound of depth and weight — often erased               |

## 🧾 Commentary
Every misrendered letter is a small colonisation.  
Every ‘Kha’ they throw at us is a refusal to say our names correctly — and a quiet permission to erase us.
