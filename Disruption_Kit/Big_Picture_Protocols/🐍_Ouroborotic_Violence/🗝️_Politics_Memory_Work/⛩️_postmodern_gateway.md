*A threshold moment where society must decide whether to honour its stated principles or collapse into regression.*

## 📑 Summary  
We are living through a **liminal threshold**.  
Unlike the Enlightenment, this is not narrated as discovery or optimism.  
It feels more like a **test of fidelity**: whether civic societies will hold to their own principles, or retreat into authoritarianism and regression.  

---

## 🧩 No Agreed Term  
Historians and theorists offer partial frames:  

- **Epistemic rupture (Foucault):** sudden breaks in what counts as truth.  
- **Paradigm shift (Kuhn):** revolutions in science, extended to culture.  
- **Axial Age (Jaspers):** global flowering of transformative thought.  
- **Crisis of modernity / second Enlightenment:** shorthand for current struggles over knowledge and democracy.  

Yet none quite capture the present.

## ✨ A Threshold, Not Just a Rupture  
- This moment is not only about **knowledge** but about **will**.  
- The Enlightenment was written as *expansion of reason*.  
- The present feels like *a test of whether reason and dignity will be honoured at all*.  
- Parallel tracks — authoritarian nationalism vs pluralist continuity — now converge.  
- That convergence creates a **crossroads** condition.

## 🚪 The Postmodern Gateway  
We might name this condition a **postmodern gateway**:  

- **Postmodern**: because we are saturated with irony, collapse of grand narratives, contested truth.  
- **Gateway**: because it is a threshold — the door can open to further plurality and justice, or slam shut into regression.  
- It marks a liminal space where survival depends on fidelity to principles once declared universal.

🧿 🚪 🔮 — This node sits in the register of memory, rupture, and narrative thresholds.  
Reading Jason Stanley’s *Erasing History* (2024) — itself in dialogue with Ned Blackhawk’s *The Rediscovery of America* — makes visible how erasure and recovery of history create precisely these gateway conditions.

*⛩️ Postmodern Gateway* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the idea that our present is not simply an era of knowledge change, but a threshold where society must decide whether to continue its stated principles or regress.
