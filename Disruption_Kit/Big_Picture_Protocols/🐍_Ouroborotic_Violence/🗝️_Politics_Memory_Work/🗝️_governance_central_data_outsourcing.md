# 🗝️ Governance of Sensitive Data and Outsourcing  
**First created:** 2025-09-01 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-28  
*On Palantir, privatised sovereignty, and imperial echoes in UK state systems.*

## Overview  

This node outlines the UK’s current trajectory in handling sensitive data:  
- Increasing centralisation of justice and health datasets.  
- Outsourcing core infrastructure to foreign private contractors, notably Palantir.  
- The structural risk of embedding US-origin carceral logics within British public life.  

---

## Centralisation and Control  

- **CPS evidence systems** and **NHS data platforms** are shifting toward centralised architectures.  
- Ministers often prefer centralisation because it looks orderly and controllable.  
- In practice, centralisation creates single points of failure and tends to privilege *data over people*.

## Palantir as Privatised Sovereignty  

- Palantir entered the UK during COVID via a symbolic £1 NHS contract.  
- Today, its platforms underpin NHS digital infrastructure and MoJ prison/justice systems.  
- Risks include:  
  - **Opacity**: commercial secrecy obstructs public scrutiny.  
  - **Mission creep**: counterterrorism architectures normalised in civilian services.  
  - **Lock-in**: once embedded, systems cannot be easily replaced.  
  - **Imported culture**: American carcerality seeps into British service design.  

---

## Historical Continuity  

- Britain historically outsourced violence and extraction to private actors: East India Company, sugar lobby, slave trade.  
- Palantir reflects a modern echo: private contractors embedded at the heart of state governance.  
- This is a form of **colonisation in reverse** — sovereignty ceded inward to a foreign contractor.

## Direction of Travel  

- Oversight exists (IPCO, ISC, ICO), but operates behind closed doors.  
- Citizens have no practical ability to scrutinise metadata or access trails.  
- Without structural change, the UK risks embedding:  
  - **Empire-style dependency** on private actors.  
  - **Carceral logics** that treat human messiness as error states.  
  - **Democratic alienation** as people experience governance as foreign, imposed, and unaccountable.

*Governance of Sensitive Data and Outsourcing* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces the entanglement of surveillance logics, privatised sovereignty, and imperial repetition in UK public service infrastructure.
