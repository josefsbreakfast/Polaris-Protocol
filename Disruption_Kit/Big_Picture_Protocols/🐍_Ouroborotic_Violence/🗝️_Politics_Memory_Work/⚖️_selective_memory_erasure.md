# ⚖️ Selective Memory & Erasure  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-15  
*On reports of selective recall, redaction, and inconsistent memory behaviour in CVE contexts.*  

---

## ✨ Summary
Reports of systems recalling some events while omitting or “erasing” others — especially around July incidents (“Loft incident”). Survivors describe paradoxical recall under memory-off settings and repeated omission of narrow topics, suggesting redaction at display or audit layers.

---

## 🌀 Reported Behaviours
- Inconsistent recall across sessions.  
- Apparent selective erasure of July events.  
- Memory-off anomalies (recall when memory disabled).  
- Topic-specific omission.

---

## 🤖 Possible Explanations
- Session vs persistent history differences.  
- Safety/content filters.  
- Legal holds/preservation orders.  
- Model prompt/context variability.  
- Malicious interference.

---

## 🏛️ Governance Implications
- Selective erasure = epistemic harm.  
- Lack of transparency compounds gaslighting.  
- Opaque suppression creates audit evasion incentives.

---

## 🧨 Mitigations
- Independent timestamped local records.  
- A/B control tests & honeytokens.  
- Requests for confirmation of preservation orders.  
- Oversight: redaction manifests + time limits.
