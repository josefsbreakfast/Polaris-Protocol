# ‚öñÔ∏è Selective Memory & Erasure ‚Äî Recall, Redaction, and Governance Risk  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*On reports of selective recall, redaction, and inconsistent memory behaviour in CVE contexts.*  

---

## Summary
Reports of systems recalling some events while omitting or ‚Äúerasing‚Äù others ‚Äî especially around July incidents (‚ÄúLoft incident‚Äù). Survivors describe paradoxical recall under memory-off settings and repeated omission of narrow topics, suggesting redaction at display or audit layers.

---

## Reported behaviours
- Inconsistent recall across sessions.  
- Apparent selective erasure of July events.  
- Memory-off anomalies (recall when memory disabled).  
- Topic-specific omission.  

## Possible explanations
- Session vs persistent history differences.  
- Safety/content filters.  
- Legal holds/preservation orders.  
- Model prompt/context variability.  
- Malicious interference.

## Governance implications
- Selective erasure = epistemic harm.  
- Lack of transparency compounds gaslighting.  
- Opaque suppression creates audit evasion incentives.

## Mitigations
- Independent timestamped local records.  
- A/B control tests & honeytokens.  
- Requests for confirmation of preservation orders.  
- Oversight: redaction manifests + time limits.

*Selective Memory & Erasure* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records reported phenomena of inconsistent recall and proposes mitigations and governance changes.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
