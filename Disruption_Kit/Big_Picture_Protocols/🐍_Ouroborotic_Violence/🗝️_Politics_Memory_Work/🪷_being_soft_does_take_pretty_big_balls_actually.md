*Softness as counter-violence and memory discipline.*

## ✨ Orientation  
Softness is not surrender.  
It is the act of trusting humans again and again, in full awareness of what we are capable of.  
Within *Politics Memory Work*, softness becomes a counter-script to cruelty: a refusal to let injury dictate the terms of relation.  
It is not about manners — it is about staying human while remembering everything.

## 🪬 To Be Soft:  

It is the act of trusting humans again,  
and again and again and again,  
not in spite of or against their monumental fuck-ups,  
but while embracing the wholeness of everything humans are.  

Just because I’m soft doesn’t mean I’m not strong.  
I call my more defensive moments *spikier* — hedgehog spines meant to protect the squishy part in the middle.  

It takes courage to keep exercising compassion and not allow it to hurt so badly that we stop showing care.  
That doesn’t mean it has to look a certain way, and it bears no relation to politeness.  

It’s about giving people time and energy at reduced harm — and sometimes that does look a lot like giving someone a specific direction to fuck off to.  

Sometimes it looks much more like what we traditionally associate with maternal values.  

A few weeks ago, I grabbed one of my cats pretty firmly.  
He didn’t like it.  
He kept his distance for hours afterwards.  

The reason I grabbed him was because he was half out of the window — a high window, open wider than usual for humidity.  
He saw something and responded as an apex predator would.  
By the time I caught him, his shoulders were already past the frame.  

I grabbed him because he lacks the awareness that the window is a cliff.  
I didn’t want him to become cat pancake.  

Sometimes we do things our kids — or the people we care about — don’t like.  
Many of us struggle to assert the same boundaries with adults.  

We all get things wrong, and part of being very human (and taking a pro-social role in a functional community or society) is that sometimes we have to draw those boundaries in a way that may feel harsh.  

Better that than the social version of cat pancake.
