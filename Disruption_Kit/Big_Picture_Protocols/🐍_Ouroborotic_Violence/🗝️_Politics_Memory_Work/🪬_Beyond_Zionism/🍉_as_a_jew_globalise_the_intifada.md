# 🍉 As a Jew: “Globalise the Intifada”  
**First created:** 2025-12-17 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-24  
*A Jewish, UK-based analysis of how political rhetoric misuses antisemitism frameworks, collapses Jewish plurality, and heightens risk for racialised groups.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node addresses contemporary claims by UK politicians that the phrase *“globalise the intifada”* is inherently antisemitic or threatening to Jewish people.  
It responds as a British Jewish perspective grounded in historical literacy, PSED analysis, and the IHRA’s own safeguards — particularly the prohibition on dual-loyalty assumptions.

---

## ✨ Key Claims  

- Jewish communities are **not monolithic**, and foreign state assessments do not represent Jewish sentiment in the UK.
- Treating Palestinian liberation language as inherently antisemitic is **historically inaccurate** and politically instrumental.
- Misapplication of IHRA and PSED **increases risk** for Muslims, Palestinians, and other racialised groups while flattening Jewish identity.
- Lockstep alignment with Israeli government messaging **reintroduces dual-loyalty logic**, the very harm antisemitism frameworks are meant to prevent.

---

## 🇵🇸 Historical Grounding: Intifada Is Not a Synonym for Antisemitism  

*Intifada* literally means *“shaking off.”*  
The **First Intifada (1987–1993)** was characterised primarily by:
- mass civil resistance,
- strikes, boycotts, and community organising,
- limited weaponisation on the Palestinian civil side.

Violence escalated through state repression.  
The later association of the term with armed violence derives largely from the **Second Intifada**, a specific historical phase — not an inherent definition.

To treat the term itself as violent or antisemitic is a **selective historical reading**, not a neutral one.

---

## ⚖️ PSED: Who Is Actually Being Considered?  

Public Sector Equality Duty requires *due regard* to **all affected groups**, including:

- British Jews  
- Israeli Jews resident in the UK  
- British–Israeli Jews  
- British Palestinians  
- Palestinians resident in the UK  
- Palestinian citizens of Israel resident in the UK  
- People racialised as Palestinian (Muslim, Arab, South Asian)  

Any analysis that elevates *asserted Jewish fear* while ignoring:
- increased Islamophobia,
- racially aggravated sexual violence,
- physical risk to melanated bodies,

is **procedurally defective under PSED**.

Physical risk outweighs rhetorical discomfort. Current distributions of harm are not ambiguous.

---

## 🔥 Instrumentalised Trauma and the Survey Problem  

Jewish trauma — particularly linked to the Second Intifada — is real.  
What is unethical is its **instrumentalisation**:

- Biased surveys distributed immediately after traumatic events  
- Leading questions designed to manufacture affect  
- Data later cited to justify predetermined policy positions  

This is **behavioural nudging, not consultation**.  
It does not meet research ethics standards and should not be treated as evidence of communal consensus.

---

## 📜 IHRA Misuse and the Return of Dual-Loyalty Logic  

The IHRA working definition explicitly guards against:
> assuming Jews have dual loyalty or are more loyal to Israel than to their own nations.

When British politicians:
- echo Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs assessments,
- present them as proxies for “Jewish feeling” in Britain,
- or collapse Jewish safety into Israeli state legitimacy,

they **reintroduce the very logic IHRA is meant to prevent**.

British Jews are not an overseas constituency of a foreign state.

---

## 😒 Philosemitism, Antisemitism, and the Fear of Solidarity  

Both antisemitism and philosemitism rely on the same racist architecture:
- Jews as hyper-cohesive  
- Jews as disproportionately powerful  
- Jews as behind-the-scenes operators  

This is why Jewish solidarity with other racialised groups triggers elite panic.  
Solidarity disrupts divide-and-rule, challenges anticipatory obedience, and weakens authoritarian containment.

That fear — not Jewish safety — explains much of the current rhetoric.  

This rhetoric was part of escalation prior to the Shoah; the risk is not fictitious or ungrounded.  

---

## 🫀 Gendered Harm and Racial Reallocation  

Under pressure, racist tropes reshuffle rather than disappear:
- Jewish women framed as fragile victims or unreliable witnesses  
- Muslim and Black men hyper-sexualised as threats  
- Far-right antisemitism displaced onto Palestinian advocacy  

None of this protects Jews.  
It **heightens inter-community risk and resentment**.  

## 🦚 IHRA Misapplication, Ally Erasure, and the Pressure to Visibly Authenticate Jewishness  

Recent police operational decisions — particularly the claim that chanting *“globalise the intifada”* is arrestable because “the context has changed” — reveal a **structurally antisemitic interpretation of the IHRA working definition**, rather than a faithful application of it.

## 🐍 IHRA Inversion: Protection Recast as Pathology  

The operational logic appears to assume that:
- Jewish people form a single emotional bloc;
- Palestinian political language is inherently experienced by Jews as threat;
- Jewish safety is best protected by suppressing the speech of other racialised groups.

This interpretation violates the IHRA’s own safeguards — especially the prohibition on **collective attribution** and **dual-loyalty assumptions**. Treating Jewish people as uniquely fragile, perpetually alarmed, or politically indistinguishable from a foreign state does not protect Jews; it **pathologises Jewish identity**.

That is an antisemitic move, even when framed as concern.

---

## 🪼 “Changed Context” and the Misattribution of Risk  

The invocation of external violence (e.g. the Bondi Beach attack) as justification for suppressing UK-based Palestinian protest relies on an implied chain:

> Palestinian rhetoric → Jewish fear → antisemitic violence

This chain is **asserted, not evidenced**.

Far-right violence remains the primary, documented threat to Jewish people in the UK. Displacing that risk onto Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities does not reduce antisemitism — it **reroutes it**, while placing Jews symbolically at the centre of repression.

Historically, this is precisely how backlash forms.

---

## 🫥 Ally Erasure and the Betrayal of Community Cohesion  

This logic also erases real acts of solidarity.

In the Bondi attack, one of the individuals who intervened to stop the assailants was an Arab man from Syria. Whether Palestinian or not, he was **racialised as Arab and Muslim** — and he acted to protect Jewish lives, at grave personal risk.

Collapsing antisemitism into “Palestine-related disorder”:
- erases such interventions,
- punishes communities that repeatedly show up as allies,
- and signals that solidarity will not be recognised.

This directly undermines **community cohesion**, violating the third limb of PSED and betraying the very people whose actions materially increase Jewish safety.

---

## ✡️ Visibility Pressure and the Quiet Return of Authentication  

The cumulative effect of this discourse has produced a subtler, but deeply troubling pressure: the push for Jews to **visibly authenticate their identity** in order to be understood.

For Jews who do not conform to racialised expectations of what a Jew “looks like,” this results in:
- repeated demands for clarification,
- disbelief or misrecognition,
- and an implicit requirement to mark oneself to avoid misunderstanding.

This is not a legal mandate, but it is **coercive in practice**. It echoes earlier European dynamics — not through law, but through social pressure — where Jewish visibility becomes a prerequisite for legibility.

That is not a healthy civic environment.

---

## 🧿 What This Reveals  

Taken together, these patterns show that:
- IHRA is being operationalised in a way that **reproduces antisemitic assumptions**;
- Jewish safety is being rhetorically secured at the expense of other racialised groups;
- far-right antisemitism is obscured rather than confronted;
- and Jews are being made legible only on terms that serve state and capital interests.

This does not protect Jewish people.  
It **narrows Jewish identity, punishes solidarity, and increases long-term risk**.  

---

## 🫒 Conclusion  

Rejecting the claim that *“globalise the intifada”* is inherently antisemitic is not denial of antisemitism.  
It is refusal to let Jewish identity be:
- flattened,
- instrumentalised,
- or conscripted into protecting state and capital interests.

Jewish safety is not secured by silencing Palestinians or racialised communities.  
It is secured by **plurality, solidarity, and historical honesty**.
