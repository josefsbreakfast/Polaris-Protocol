- christian zionisms roots.
- how this jumped to jewish community.
- how and why this spread.
- how this changed the course of history for palestinians and all jews even in galut.
- how this has divided and united.

- push and pull for aaliyah, why this gets sunister the more you look at reports and census data.
- the specifics of which factions were armed and why.
- what france was up to.
- why this was actually fairly busy in wwii dude. (more just tank related than the current mythos)

- post 67 thoughts.
- what golus jews are told about "the desert" and why we should "make it bloom".
- how this has basically entirely erased every palestinian person's dignity since the early 20c.
- how western countries are individually still involved and why they "cant" let go.

- why throwing "the one jewish guy" under the bus is just kore scapegoating until i see a white westerner in the icc with him.  (hey look i am notoriously not a bibi fan but you cant just send the one jew without prividing osraels current defence on a silver platter. arrest all the war criminal potentials; youd do it to us plebs.🤷‍♀️).

- why antisemitism in the weat will never end until zioniam does.

- how the west forces jews to position in relation to zionism at all times whether we consent or not.
- the one place where baddiel and i actually agree it seems; this is racist and why are we asked it.

- how ihra reinforces antisemitism actually.
- why jda is marginally better but still problematic.

- why the west is not motivated AT ALL to have the rest of us back
- land and tort: potential assets.

- why emancipation has never been acheived in full.

- and finally: why palestinian civil society is our saving grace, why our librrations are co-dependant regardless of how we feel about that, and how paleatinians are freeing jews even "in exile".

- the religious/spiritual significsnce of galut.
- why heavily weighting gor coerced migration might be a little antisemitic.
