# 🍉 Why Do We Care About Palestine  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*Why Jewish and global political destinies remain knotted to Palestine, and how empire engineered the bind.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This file answers the question that Western governments keep pretending is mysterious:  
**Why do Jews — especially diasporic Jews — care so much about Palestine?**  

The short answer: because *Christian Europe spent centuries designing it that way*.  
The longer answer: because Zionism was never simply a Jewish movement. It was a **Christian imperial project**, retrofitted later onto Jewish communities, with consequences that reshaped Palestinian life, global Jewish identity, and even the geopolitical incentives of the 21st-century West.

This node traces how these forces produced:  
- coerced political identification for Jews,  
- generational trauma and mythmaking about “the land,”  
- Western complicity in both Palestinian dispossession and Jewish vulnerability,  
- and the uncomfortable truth that **Palestinian civil society is the only actor consistently treating Jewish liberation and Palestinian liberation as linked rather than oppositional**.

## ✨ Key Features  

- The Christian origins of Zionist ideology and how this architecture was imposed onto Jewish identity.  
- How Zionism’s spread inside Jewish communities reshaped both Palestinian fate and global Jewish belonging.  
- Coerced migration, “aliyah” push–pull dynamics, and the unsettling data beneath the romance.  
- WWII realities: armed factions, French involvement, and the myth vs. the material history.  
- Post-1967 mythologies: “desert blooming,” erasure, and dignity theft.  
- Why Western states cannot “let go”: land, tort, assets, and imperial continuity.  
- How IHRA and JDA reproduce antisemitism instead of relieving it.  
- Why Western societies force Jews to position themselves relative to Zionism.  
- Why emancipation remains unfinished — and why Jewish liberation depends materially on Palestinian liberation.  
- Galut as a spiritual, political, and anti-coercive principle.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. **Christian Zionism: the original architecture**  
The earliest Zionist political programmes were Christian fantasies:  
- a theological belief that Jews must return to Palestine for eschatology,  
- a colonial belief that Europeans could engineer the Near East,  
- and a racial-science belief that Jews were a “problem population” who should be moved elsewhere.

This architecture predated — and later kidnapped — Jewish political identity. The tragedy is that Jewish communities were pressured into accepting a framework never built for our safety.

### 2. **How the idea jumped into Jewish communal life**  
Late 19th-century European nationalism excluded Jews, then blamed them for lacking a nation-state. Zionism became the only exit door we were offered — not because it solved antisemitism, but because Europe wanted the **moral convenience of exporting its Jewish problem**.

This reshaped Jewish internal debates, divided households, united others, and ultimately changed the trajectory of millions of Palestinians who were living their own lives in their own land — until someone else’s theology landed on them.

### 3. **Aliyah: push–pull dynamics that get darker with census data**  
The more you look at the numbers, the more the romance collapses:  
- migration spikes correlate with **host-country hostility**, not “returning home”;  
- economic programmes and militarised incentives distort voluntariness;  
- demographic engineering projects turn Jewish lives into state assets.

Some “pull factors” were actually **push factors wearing better clothes**.

### 4. **Armed factions, France, WWII, and the real terrain**  
Forget the mythos: the region was **far from empty**, **far from passive**, and **far from inevitable**.  
- Jewish paramilitary factions had distinct politics, distinct funders, and distinct endgames.  
- The French were pursuing their own anti-British, anti-Arab, and anti-communist agendas.  
- And WWII brought tanks, espionage, fracturing alliances — not a blank moral canvas.

Understanding this complexity is essential to understanding the violence that unfolded later.

### 5. **Post-67: the myth of “the desert” and the dignity theft**  
Diaspora Jews were told the propaganda line:  
> “The land was empty; we made it bloom.”  

This is a profound erasure of Palestinian agriculture, engineering, craftsmanship, and belonging. It manufactures Jewish pride by annihilating Palestinian dignity — a moral trap that deforms both peoples.

### 6. **Why Western governments will not let go**  
Three reasons:  
- **Land & tort:** recognising Palestinian rights would trigger massive reparations, asset claims, and geopolitical losses.  
- **Strategic colonial continuity:** Israel serves the same functions earlier protectorates served.  
- **Moral outsourcing:** supporting Zionism lets Western states avoid confronting their own antisemitism.

This is why the West keeps insisting the “one Jewish guy” (Bibi, historically others) is the singular problem — as if the system around him were clean. It’s scapegoating, plain and simple.

### 7. **Why antisemitism in the West will not end until Zionism does**  
Not because Zionism caused antisemitism, but because **Zionism gives Western societies an alibi**:  
“We’re not antisemitic — look, we support Israel.”  
This allows antisemitism to operate unchecked beneath the surface. Jews become perpetually foreign, perpetually suspect, perpetually responsible for a state many of us never chose.

### 8. **The coercive positioning of Jews**  
Baddiel and you agree here:  
It is racist to treat Jews as people who must have an opinion on Israel, as if our citizenship elsewhere is conditional. The question itself is antisemitism.

### 9. **IHRA & JDA: why both frameworks misfire**  
- **IHRA** collapses Palestinian testimony into “antisemitism,” punishing truth-telling and making Jews less safe.  
- **JDA** is more nuanced but still centres Jewish reaction over Palestinian material conditions.

Both reinforce the idea that Jewish safety is incompatible with Palestinian freedom — an imperial fantasy, not a reality.

### 10. **Why the West isn’t motivated to welcome Jews back**  
Because the calculus hasn’t changed.  
Jews returning in large numbers would require addressing:  
- property restitution,  
- citizenship rights,  
- security guarantees,  
- and the history of expulsion.

Empire prefers its ghosts exiled.

### 11. **Emancipation: still incomplete**  
Jewish emancipation was never finished — it was **interrupted**, repackaged, and partially rescinded. Until Jews can exist without being forced into Zionist or anti-Zionist performance, emancipation remains theory.

### 12. **Why we care about Palestine: the shared liberation problem**  
Palestinians understand something Western governments refuse to admit:  
- that **our futures are materially linked**,  
- that liberation cannot be one-sided,  
- and that dignity is indivisible.

This is why Palestinian civil society continues to treat Jewish liberation as part of their own horizon. Even “in exile,” they are freeing us — from empire’s scripts, from coerced identities, from the lie that safety can be built atop someone else’s dispossession.

### 13. **Galut as spiritual and political knowledge**  
Galut teaches:  
- coercion corrodes identity,  
- exile can be ethical,  
- and belonging cannot be forced by the state.  

This is why over-emphasising coerced migration as “aliyah” is not just dishonest — it borders on antisemitic. It denies the legitimacy of diaspora, and denies the violence done to push people there.

*🍉 Why Do We Care About Palestine* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, documenting how Jewish, Palestinian, and Western political destinies have been entangled by empire. It reframes the question of “Jewish investment” not as pathology but as historical inevitability — and as a site of shared liberation.
