# 🧿 Dependency on Western Definitions  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*How reliance on Western institutional definitions constrains memory, ethics, and political imagination — especially in post-trauma contexts.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines how political, moral, and historical analysis becomes distorted when legitimacy is outsourced to Western institutional definitions.

It sits at the intersection of:
- antisemitism discourse,
- Holocaust memory governance,
- Zionism and its critics,
- and the broader problem of who gets to define harm, hatred, and legitimacy.

The focus is not denial, erasure, or relativism — but **dependency**:  
what happens when moral language is only considered valid if it passes through Western state-aligned frameworks.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Interrogates **IHRA-style definitional authority** without collapsing into bad-faith denialism  
- Distinguishes antisemitism as a lived harm from antisemitism as a **governance instrument**  
- Explores how Western definitions freeze historical trauma into static moral capital  
- Situates Zionism within broader memory-politics rather than exceptional moral insulation  

---

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Antisemitismus (deliberately spelled)

This section will examine antisemitism **prior to and outside** contemporary Western legal-bureaucratic definitions.

Key tensions to unpack:
- Antisemitism as a historical, material violence  
- Antisemitism as a moral absolute deployed selectively  
- Antisemitism discourse as a *closure mechanism* rather than an opening for repair  

The spelling here is intentional: a signal that this is not starting from Anglo-American framing.

---

### 2. IHRA and the Politics of Definition  

The IHRA definition functions less as a descriptive tool and more as a **boundary-setting device**.

Questions this section will pursue:
- Who authored legitimacy, and under what geopolitical conditions?  
- What kinds of speech become unsayable — and by whom?  
- How does definitional power travel downstream into institutions, universities, and media?  

This is not an argument that antisemitism is unreal.  
It is an argument that **definition monopolies distort ethical response**.

---

### 3. Beyond Zionism (without pretending neutrality)

“Beyond Zionism” here does not mean:
- post-Jewishness  
- post-trauma  
- or moral equivalence theatre  

It means refusing to treat Zionism as the **terminal moral reference point** for Jewish safety, memory, or political legitimacy.

This section will sit with the discomfort:
- that Western memory work demands Zionism as proof of learning history  
- while Palestinian existence is rendered administratively conditional  

---

### 4. Dependency as a Structural Harm  

Reliance on Western definitions produces several predictable failures:

- Trauma becomes credentialed rather than lived  
- Moral speech becomes procedural  
- Survivors outside the West are forced to translate themselves into hostile grammars  

Dependency here is not intellectual laziness — it is **structural coercion**.  

---

### 5. True Self-Definition (and why it is treated as a threat)

At the core of dependency on Western definitions lies a quieter prohibition:  
**true self-definition is not permitted unless it aligns with existing moral architectures.**

Groups may describe their suffering, history, or identity only insofar as it:
- confirms what institutions already recognise,
- fits pre-authorised vocabularies,
- and does not disrupt geopolitical alignments.

Self-definition that exceeds these bounds is routinely recoded as:
- radicalisation,
- extremism,
- bias,
- or incoherence.

This is not accidental.  
True self-definition is destabilising because it **breaks the dependency loop**.

---

#### Self-Definition vs Recognised Identity

Western governance systems tolerate *recognised identity*, not self-defined identity.

The distinction is structural:

- **Recognised identity** is legible, auditable, and containable  
- **Self-definition** is historically grounded, internally coherent, and politically inconvenient  

Recognition asks: *Can we place you?*  
Self-definition asks: *Why do you get to place me at all?*

---

#### Trauma Translation as a Control Mechanism

In post-trauma contexts, self-definition is often forced through translation regimes:

- Survivors must describe themselves using approved moral grammar  
- Historical experience must be framed as lesson, not accusation  
- Memory must be pedagogical, never disruptive  

Those who refuse translation are not debated with — they are disciplined.

This produces a persistent paradox:
- Trauma is endlessly invoked  
- But the traumatised subject is denied authorship over meaning  

---

#### Antisemitism Discourse and the Boundary of Speech

This is where antisemitism discourse becomes structurally dangerous when monopolised.

Not because antisemitism is unreal — but because:
- the definition becomes a **gatekeeping device**,  
- Jewish self-definition outside sanctioned political forms becomes suspect,  
- and non-Jewish critique is forced into moral performance rather than ethical argument.

The outcome is not safety.  
It is **silencing disguised as protection**.

---

#### Beyond Zionism as a Self-Definition Claim

“Beyond Zionism” functions here not as an ideology, but as a **self-definition demand**.

It asserts that:
- Jewish life is not reducible to state ideology  
- Historical trauma does not obligate permanent political alignment  
- Safety cannot be secured through the denial of another people’s reality  

This is why the phrase provokes disproportionate alarm.  
Self-definition reopens moral questions institutions have already closed.

---

#### Why Western Systems Resist This

True self-definition threatens:
- policy stability,
- moral capital economies,
- and narrative control over historical violence.

It is therefore framed as dangerous rather than necessary.

Dependency on Western definitions ultimately demands that people  
**outsource their own meaning**.

This node refuses that demand.

*🧿 Dependency on Western Definitions* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It contributes a structural critique of how moral authority is centralised, exported, and enforced in contexts shaped by historical trauma and ongoing violence.
