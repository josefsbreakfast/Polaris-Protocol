# 🗝️ Power Is Not a Mitzvah  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*On why Jewish tradition treats power as dangerous, conditional, and often better refused.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Jewish tradition does not treat power as inherently good.  
It treats power as **morally hazardous**.

The rabbinic posture across centuries is clear:  
> If holding authority increases the risk of grave transgression, it may be better not to hold it at all.

This node exists to counter the modern claim that Jewishness requires sovereignty — or that sovereignty is itself a religious achievement.

It is not.

## ✨ Key Features  

- Rabbinic suspicion of authority and coercion.  
- Why restraint is valued over dominance.  
- Temple Mount prohibitions as a case study.  
- The difference between responsibility and entitlement.  
- Why “having a state” is not a religious accomplishment.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. **Responsibility increases the risk of sin**  
Rabbinic Judaism assumes:  
- humans are fallible,  
- power magnifies error,  
- and public wrongdoing carries collective consequence.

This is why halakhic systems are dense with safeguards, delays, prohibitions, and abstentions.

### 2. **The Temple Mount prohibition tells you everything**  
Mainstream halakhic consensus has long held that Jews must not ascend the Temple Mount because the Holy of Holies cannot be located with certainty.

The logic is simple and devastating to triumphalism:  
> Better to abstain than to risk desecration.

Celebrating violations of this prohibition in the name of “Jewish sovereignty” is not religious fidelity — it is nationalist hubris.

### 3. **Why sovereignty was historically treated with caution**  
For most of Jewish history, Jews developed:  
- law without kings,  
- ethics without armies,  
- continuity without domination.

This was not accidental.  
It reflected a deep awareness that power tempts abuse.

### 4. **Modern inversion**  
Modern Zionism inverted this logic:  
- power became the solution,  
- sovereignty became the proof,  
- restraint became weakness.

This is a political philosophy — not a halakhic one.
