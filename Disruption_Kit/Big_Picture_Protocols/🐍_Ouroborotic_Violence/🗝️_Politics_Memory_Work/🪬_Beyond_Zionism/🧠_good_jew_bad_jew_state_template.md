# 🧠 Good Jew / Bad Jew State Template

**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14
*How state and institutional frameworks sort Jewish people into compliant and non-compliant archetypes.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node documents how contemporary British institutions implicitly sort Jewish people into a **"Good Jew / Bad Jew" template** — a classificatory mechanism produced by security policy, equality frameworks, and ideological training regimes.

This sorting is rarely explicit. It operates through expectations, incentives, and penalties that define which forms of Jewish identity are legible, protected, and rewarded, and which are rendered suspicious, disruptive, or unsafe.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Jewish identity is treated as *conditionally acceptable*
* Compliance is measured through political alignment, not behaviour
* Dissenting Jews face heightened scrutiny, not neutrality
* The template is reinforced through training, policy, and safeguarding systems

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. The archetypes

The state template does not ask whether someone is Jewish. It asks **what kind of Jew** they are.

**The "Good Jew" archetype:**

* aligns publicly with Israel or remains silent
* frames Jewishness as cultural or private
* expresses gratitude for protection
* avoids political disruption
* is legible within IHRA-based training frameworks

**The "Bad Jew" archetype:**

* anti-occupation or anti-Zionist
* politically articulate
* foregrounds international law or historical critique
* refuses securitised protection
* disrupts institutional narratives

This distinction is not moral — it is administrative.

---

### 2. How the template is enforced

The sorting mechanism is maintained through:

* mandatory training modules
* reputational signalling in institutions
* selective amplification of certain Jewish voices
* silence or distancing from dissenting Jews
* risk framing via Prevent and safeguarding crossovers

Jews who fall outside the preferred template encounter friction: misinterpretation, escalation, or isolation.

---

### 3. Compliance masquerading as safety

Institutions often justify the template as safeguarding:

* compliant Jews are framed as "safe"
* dissenting Jews are framed as "risky"

Yet this reverses reality. The template does not measure vulnerability or harm; it measures **alignment with institutional comfort**.

Safety becomes conditional on conformity.

---

### 4. The interaction with Prevent

Within Prevent-influenced environments, the template hardens:

* political speech by Jews is scrutinised
* emotional distress is reframed as instability
* refusal to endorse Zionism is misread as extremism

The result is a profiling risk that applies *inside* a group supposedly being protected.

---

### 5. Psychological and social consequences

The Good/Bad Jew split produces predictable harms:

* self-censorship
* withdrawal from institutions
* erosion of trust in safeguarding systems
* isolation of dissenting Jews
* moral injury and exhaustion

Rather than reducing antisemitism, the template fractures Jewish safety from within.

*Good Jew / Bad Jew State Template* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**. It explains how institutional safety frameworks sort Jewish people into compliant and non-compliant categories, creating internal vulnerability under the guise of protection.
