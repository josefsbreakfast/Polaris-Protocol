# 🧠 Identity Sliding: Race–Religion Discrimination

**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14
*How discrimination against anti-Zionist Jews shifts between race and religion depending on the discriminator’s frame.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node analyses a recurring failure point in equality and safeguarding frameworks: the phenomenon of **identity sliding**, where discrimination against Jewish people — particularly anti-Zionist Jews — is alternately framed as racial, religious, or political depending on what is most convenient for the discriminator or institution.

Although the Equality Act 2010 formally protects Jewish people under both race and religion, this protection often collapses in practice when Jewish identity is treated as *contingent on political alignment*. The result is a form of discrimination that is real, material, and harmful, yet persistently misclassified or denied.

## ✨ Key Features

* Jewish identity is alternately racialised or theologised on demand
* Anti-Zionist Jews experience compound vulnerability
* Political disagreement is used to mask racial or religious discrimination
* Responsibility is displaced from perpetrators onto the targeted person’s behaviour

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. The sliding mechanism

Identity sliding occurs when institutions or individuals shift how they categorise Jewish identity in order to justify exclusion or discipline.

* When it suits, Judaism is framed as **only a religion** — stripping Jews of racial or ethnic protection
* When it suits, Jews are framed as a **racial or ethnic bloc** — to impose assumed political loyalties

This movement is not neutral. It is a mechanism for evading accountability.

---

### 2. The anti-Zionist Jewish bind

Anti-Zionist Jews are especially exposed to identity sliding because they violate a common, unspoken assumption: that Jewishness entails support for Zionism or the Israeli state.

When an anti-Zionist Jew is harmed:

* institutions may claim the issue is "political," not racial or religious
* critics may argue Judaism is "just a belief," and therefore optional
* discrimination is reframed as disagreement

Yet the harm occurs *because* the person is Jewish — and because they refuse to perform the expected version of Jewishness.

---

### 3. Religious discrimination route

If Judaism is treated as a religion only, identity sliding produces religious discrimination:

* Jews are told what "real" Judaism requires
* theological disagreement is punished institutionally
* long-standing anti-statist or diasporic Jewish traditions are delegitimised

Anti-Zionist Judaism — which predates modern nation-states — is treated as deviant or inauthentic.

---

### 4. Racial discrimination route

If Judaism is treated as race or ethnicity, identity sliding produces racial discrimination:

* Jews are assumed to share political loyalties
* dissent is framed as betrayal of group identity
* Jewish people are homogenised and stereotyped

Political ideology is racialised, and deviation is punished.

---

### 5. Why institutions struggle to see the harm

Equality frameworks often fail here because they:

* focus on *what the victim said or did*
* defer to the stated intent of the discriminator
* treat politics as external to identity

This obscures the fact that the **discriminator’s assumptions**, not the victim’s politics, are what activate the harm.

---

### 6. Identity sliding as containment

Identity sliding functions as a containment technique:

* it fragments protected characteristics
* it renders some harms unnameable
* it isolates dissenting Jews
* it protects institutional comfort

The person targeted must continually re-explain themselves, while the system remains unchallenged.

*Identity Sliding: Race–Religion Discrimination* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**. It documents how flexible categorisation of Jewish identity enables discrimination to persist while evading legal and ethical accountability.
