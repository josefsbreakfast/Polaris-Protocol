*Emerging legal recognition of anti-Zionist Judaism and the limits of current equality frameworks.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines the emerging legal recognition of **anti-Zionism as a protected philosophical or religious position**, particularly where it is inseparable from Jewish identity. It also documents the significant limits of this recognition within existing equality and safeguarding frameworks.

While recent tribunal decisions suggest movement, institutional practice continues to lag behind legal principle.

## ✨ Key Features

* Anti-Zionism may qualify as a protected belief
* Jewish anti-Zionism predates modern nation-states
* Legal recognition does not guarantee institutional safety
* Enforcement gaps remain wide

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. The Miller tribunal context

The David Miller employment tribunal recognised that anti-Zionism can constitute a **protected philosophical belief** under the Equality Act when it meets established criteria (seriousness, coherence, cogency).

Crucially, the ruling did not endorse all of Miller’s speech. It recognised that **anti-Zionism itself is not antisemitism**.

---

### 2. Jewish specificity

For many Jews, anti-Zionism is not merely political but:

* religiously grounded
* historically continuous
* ethically compelled
* embedded in diasporic tradition

This makes Jewish anti-Zionism qualitatively different from generic political opposition.

---

### 3. The protection gap

Despite legal recognition:

* institutions still treat anti-Zionist Jews as problematic
* IHRA-based training overrides equality reasoning
* Prevent logic reframes protected belief as risk

The existence of protection in law does not translate into safety in practice.

---

### 4. Threshold manipulation

Institutions often evade protection by:

* reframing discrimination as political disagreement
* citing reputational risk
* invoking safeguarding or extremism duties

Thresholds are moved to avoid accountability.

---

### 5. What recognition would actually require

Meaningful protection would require:

* explicit guidance recognising Jewish anti-Zionism
* separation of antisemitism from Israeli state critique
* limits on Prevent applicability in care contexts
* accountability for misclassification

Without this, legal recognition remains symbolic.
