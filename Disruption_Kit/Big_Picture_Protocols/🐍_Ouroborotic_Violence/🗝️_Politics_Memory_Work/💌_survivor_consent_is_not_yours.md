# 💌 Survivor Consent Is Not Yours

*My name and story are not political footballs. Consent does not extend to opportunistic power games.*

I don’t give people who talk about rape and child sexual abuse as political football permission to use my name.  
I don’t give them permission to use my story.  
I don’t give them permission to co-opt what was done to me and what I have to live with into their own shit to play with.  

I want these monsters to start taking my name and what happened to me out of their mouths.  
I give them permission for NOTHING.  

It pisses me off when I’m silenced, when survivor voice is treated like it can be cut, erased, or “moderated” without explanation.  
That is shutting us up.  
That is containment.  
That is political convenience dressed up as care.  

NONE OF YOU CARE.  
Not the nationalists, not the liberals, not the ones who claim they care more.  
Rape survivors, child sexual abuse survivors, are your collective political football while you vie for power.  
NONE of you give a fuck about us.

*Survivor Consent Is Not Yours* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the sovereign refusal of survivors to have their names, bodies, or stories weaponised as political footballs. Moderation, erasure, or appropriation of survivor testimony is itself a form of containment.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
