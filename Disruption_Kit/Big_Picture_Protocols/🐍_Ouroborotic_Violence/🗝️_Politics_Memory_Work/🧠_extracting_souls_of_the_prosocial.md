# 🧠 Extracting Souls Of The Prosocial  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*How systems quietly extract labour, compliance, and emotional regulation from cooperative individuals.*

## Orientation
This note describes how institutions and behavioural-governance systems disproportionately draw on the goodwill and adaptability of prosocial individuals. The extraction is not formalised or acknowledged; it emerges from structural incentives, cultural norms, and the uneven distribution of emotional labour across populations. This belongs in the Counter_Nudge_Playbook because it reveals how influence systems concentrate pressure on the safest, kindest, and most compliant people.

## Key Features
• Prosocial people absorb system friction.
• Behavioural nudges rely on pre-existing cooperation.
• Emotional labour is extracted without recognition.
• Compliance replaces structural reform.

## What “extraction” means in this context
Extraction refers to the quiet transfer of effort, emotional energy, behavioural adjustment, and conflict management from institutions onto cooperative individuals.  
It is not intentional theft; it is an unbalanced expectation that certain people will adapt to failing systems rather than systems adapting to people.

## Why prosocial people get targeted by systems
Prosocial traits—empathy, responsibility, and social attunement—make individuals more sensitive to requests, norms, and subtle pressure. When institutions issue guidance or behavioural nudges, prosocial people adjust quickly. Others resist, ignore, or push back.  
Systems learn from these patterns and begin leaning on those who respond.

## Invisible emotional labour
Cooperative individuals often perform the emotional regulation that institutions struggle to provide.  
They de-escalate tense situations, soothe others, compensate for gaps in service delivery, or alter their behaviour to keep interactions smooth.  
This work happens automatically and is rarely acknowledged.

## Why systems default to this extraction
Public systems under strain use behavioural nudges as a low-cost mechanism for stability. Because prosocial people actually respond, systems rely on their willingness to maintain order. This is efficiency for the institution but burnout for the individual.  
When demand grows, extraction increases rather than reform.

## Consequences for the cooperative
Over time, prosocial individuals become the shock absorbers of institutional collapse. They internalise blame, feel guilty for systemic failures, and become exhausted from constant adaptation.  
Their reliability makes them more vulnerable to additional nudges, more scrutiny, and higher standards of behaviour.

## Why this is a governance risk
A system that extracts behaviour from the cooperative while failing to influence antisocial actors creates moral imbalance. It rewards non-compliance with freedom and burdens compliance with more labour.  
This produces cynicism, burnout, resentment, and long-term disengagement.

Moral / Behavioural Extraction from Prosocial People is a node in the Counter_Nudge_Playbook. It documents the structural patterns that cause cooperative individuals to carry the weight of institutional fragility and behavioural governance.
