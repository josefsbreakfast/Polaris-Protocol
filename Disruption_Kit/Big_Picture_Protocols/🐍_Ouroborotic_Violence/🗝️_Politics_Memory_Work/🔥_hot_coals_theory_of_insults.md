# 🔥 Hot Coals Theory of Insults

*How insults are recycled down social hierarchies, keeping anger lateral and containment intact.*

## ✨ Introduction  
Racial insults often recycle older insults once aimed at the poor or working class. They are like hot coals: dropped down from above, then picked up and hurled sideways. The heat is the same; only the target shifts.  

---

## 🪨 I — Origin: Class Insults  
- Working class communities historically labelled:  
  - “Dirty,” “lazy,” “breeding too much,” “uncivilised.”  
  - Mocked for speech, housing, clothing, fertility.  
- These tropes became *template insults*, ready to be reused.  

---

## 🔄 II — Recycling Process  
- Instead of extinguishing the coals, groups pass them sideways:  
  - Working class → racialised migrants.  
  - Catholic immigrants → later Muslim families.  
  - “Too many kids” → endlessly re-targeted.  
- Each generation hurls the same burning phrases at someone else.

## 🕸️ III — Containment Function  
- **Anger stays lateral, not vertical.**  
  Communities fight each other instead of confronting the system above.  
- **Insults retain heat.**  
  Centuries of layered use make them sting even in new contexts.  
- **Solidarity gets blocked.**  
  Shared oppression is obscured by recycled tropes.

## ♨️ IV — Cultural Metaphor: The Hot Coal  
- **Picking up the insult** = taking pain once inflicted on you.  
- **Throwing it sideways** = refusing to confront the real source of heat.  
- The coals remain hot until someone breaks the cycle and stamps them out.  

---

## 🌋 Conclusion  
The “hot coals” theory shows:  
- Tropes are not new; they are recycled containment tools.  
- Lateral conflict is cultivated to prevent vertical solidarity.  
- Liberation requires recognising the recycled heat — and refusing to pass it on.
