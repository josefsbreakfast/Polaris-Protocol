# ☘️ The Good Friday Agreement and Palestine Action Prisoners  
**First created:** 2025-12-17 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-15  
*How contemporary custodial practices erode the trust architecture of peace agreements.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines whether the treatment of Palestine Action prisoners — particularly hunger strikes under security framing — undermines the principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement (GFA), without legally voiding it.

---

## 🫁 The GFA as a Living System  
The Good Friday Agreement relies on:
- Human rights as a stabilising floor  
- Custody governed by law, not attrition  
- Good-faith state conduct under pressure  

It does not survive on text alone. It survives on **continued restraint**.  

---

## 🫀 Historical Sensitivity of Hunger Strikes  
In Northern Ireland, hunger strikes are not neutral. They sit in a collective memory where:
- Political protest was criminalised  
- Prison became a site of escalation  
- State refusal to engage resulted in deaths  

The GFA was designed to end that logic.  

---

## 🌋 Contemporary Resonance  
When the state:
- Reclassifies protest as extremism  
- Refuses engagement with MPs  
- Overrides medical advice  
- Accepts the risk of death in custody  

…it reactivates the very dynamics the Agreement sought to close.  

---

## 🕳️ Undermining Without Breach  
No single incident nullifies the GFA. But such conduct:
- Weakens confidence in the UK as a guarantor  
- Strengthens continuity arguments  
- Erodes the credibility of rights-based assurances  

Peace agreements fail by erosion, not rupture.
