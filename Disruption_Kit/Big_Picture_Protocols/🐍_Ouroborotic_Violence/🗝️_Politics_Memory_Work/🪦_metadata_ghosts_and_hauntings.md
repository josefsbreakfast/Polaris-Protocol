# 🪦 Metadata Ghosts and Hauntings

*Containment & anomaly typologies in Polaris visibility diagnostics.*

## ✨ Overview  

Some posts exhibit **disproportionate visibility patterns** — impressions rise without proportional engagement, growth curves resist natural decay, and the cause remains invisible.  

Polaris classifies these as:  
- **Ghosts** → Active presence manipulating or touching the post  
- **Hauntings** → Passive echo of a past interaction still influencing the post  

---

## 👻 Ghosts (Active)  

**Nature**  
A live actor — human or automated — is currently interacting with the post in a way that shapes its reach.  

**Signature**  
- Sudden trajectory shifts  
- “Warm” metrics → active energy in growth  
- Often linked to a **single, high-reach profile** touching the post (like, view, partial share) without public engagement  

**Behaviour**  
- Post remains in an elevated state while the ghost is present  
- Disappears if the actor stops interacting or the signal is cut  

**Example**  
A post jumps into a steady growth curve after a silent touch from a large network account, despite no visible spike in reactions or comments.

## 🪦 Hauntings (Passive)  

**Nature**  
A past interaction leaves a lingering algorithmic trace — no active presence, but the system still “remembers” the touch.  

**Signature**  
- Slow, persistent climb long after posting  
- “Cold” metrics → no sign of current energy, but numbers tick upward  
- Often triggered by a **single, deliberate, targeted interaction** weeks or months later  

**Behaviour**  
- Metrics move like a drip-feed  
- Can persist indefinitely in background processes  

**Example**  
An old post suddenly re-enters light circulation after a subtle interaction, maintaining a trickle of impressions without any fresh activity.

## 📊 Signature Comparison Table  

| Signature Trait     | Ghost (Active)                                | Haunting (Passive)           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Energy State**    | Warm – live presence                          | Cold – lingering trace       |
| **Trigger Type**    | High-reach profile touch / silent interaction | Past targeted interaction    |
| **Growth Pattern**  | Sudden trajectory shift, sustained rise       | Slow, persistent climb       |
| **Duration**        | While actor is active                         | Weeks to months              |
| **Speed of Change** | Fast onset, then steady                       | Very slow and steady         |
| **Actor Visibility**| Invisible but current                         | Invisible, historical        |
| **Emotional Signal**| Alert / watchful                              | Unsettling / background hum  |

## 👁️‍🗨️ Shared Traits  

- **Invisible causality** → no public-facing action explains the movement  
- **Disproportionate ratios** → reach far exceeds engagement  
- **Non-natural curves** → avoids the normal rise/plateau/decay lifecycle  

---

## 🔬 Operational Use  

- **Early tagging** → note the first irregular climb and log timestamp  
- **Sensory check** → record subjective feeling (“warm” = ghost, “cold” = haunting)  
- **Network mapping** → compare ghost/haunting events to other anomalies (throttling, demographic skew)  
- **Signal awareness** → treat ghosts and hauntings as signs of deeper network routing

## 🏮 Footer  

*Metadata Ghosts and Hauntings* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It defines ghost and haunting phenomena in visibility metrics and situates them as early indicators of covert suppression or silent amplification.
