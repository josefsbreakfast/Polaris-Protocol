*How adolescent expression under pseudonyms is misframed as “extremism evidence”.*  

---

## 🖋️ Normal Behaviour  
- Teenagers write moody, angry, fantastical, or political poems.  
- They experiment with **pseudonyms**, sometimes of another gender, sometimes theatrical.  
- This is ordinary identity play, often heightened by trauma or marginalisation.  

---

## 🔎 Misframing as “Evidence”  
In vendetta-driven or panic-driven systems, such material is reinterpreted as:  
- **Proof of radicalisation** → dark metaphors treated as manifestos.  
- **Proof of gender instability** → male pseudonym equated to pathology.  
- **Proof of deception** → pseudonym itself coded as suspicious.  

---

## 🎭 Why It’s Extremely Silly  
- **False equivalence**: creative outlet ≠ operational extremism.  
- **Ignoring base rates**: millions of teens write pseudonymous poetry, almost none commit violence.  
- **Punishment inflation**: harmless adolescent work becomes decades of surveillance.  
- **Projection**: pretext masks the real motive — adult vendetta, institutional pride, or toxic competition.  

---

## 🌪️ Harms  
- **Dilution of the term “extremism”** — trivialises genuine threats.  
- **Pathologising coping** — normal adolescent creativity becomes incriminating.  
- **Entrenched files** — once written up as “evidence,” it sticks for years.  
- **Human cost** — both the teen (living hell of surveillance) and any professional who once defended them (ongoing smear).

## 🏮 Footer  
*Teen Poetry as Pretext* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It illustrates how banal creative expression can be weaponised as institutional justification for vendetta, producing absurd yet enduring harms.
