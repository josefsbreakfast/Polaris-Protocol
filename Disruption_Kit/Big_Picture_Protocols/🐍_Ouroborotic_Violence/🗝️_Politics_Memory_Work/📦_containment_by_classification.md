# 📦 Containment by Classification  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*How misidentification, racialisation, and demographic boxes are weaponised as suppression tactics.*  

---

## 📑 Summary  
Containment often works through **classification**.  
When systems — or people acting through them — cannot understand someone outside of a fixed category, they force placement into a box.  
These boxes rarely match lived reality.  
But they carry political and social weight, shaping access, belonging, and legitimacy.  

---

## 🧩 Misidentification and Flooding  
- Across contexts, ancestry and identity were misread: Baltic, Dutch, Ashkenazi, Irish, Eastern European, Celtic.  
- Interference tactics built on these assumptions, producing:  
  - **Antisemitic floods** of content.  
  - **Nudges toward/away** from specific community spaces.  
  - **Algorithmic classification theatre** (e.g. TikToks attempting eugenics-style categorisation).  
- The result was confusion by design: to erode self-understanding and block authentic community access.  

---

## ☑️ Tick-Box Fragility  
- Census and study categories (e.g. *White British*) demand a static tick.  
- Yet lived treatment shifts: regarded as white in some contexts, foreign in others.  
- No guidance exists for how to answer when perception and self-description diverge.  
- Data built on these categories hides the instability of the boxes themselves.  
- Containment exploits this fragility, creating doubt about legitimacy.

## ✝️ Christian as Classification  
- Reactionary figures use “Christian” as a demographic box, not a faith practice.  
- Many self-identify due to baptism, school entry, or ceremonies — not belief.  
- Political actors instrumentalise this as proof of a “Christian nation.”  
- Leaders themselves rarely practice (cannot recite prayers, do not attend church).  
- This gap shows religion deployed as an exclusion tool, not a lived community.  

---

## 🗳️ Manufactured Belonging  
- Identity categories are mobilised to build **mass voting blocs**, not communities.  
- Synthetic belonging is created from above, rather than arising from shared life.  
- People’s real needs (belonging, dignity, meaningful lives) are deflected into defending hollow symbols.  
- Produces short-term mobilisation but leaves no lasting community.  
- Belonging is promised but not delivered.

*Containment by Classification* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how rigid categories — racial, religious, or demographic — are used to suppress, misidentify, and contain.
