## ✨ Overview  

Despite world-class universities and tech clusters, the UK has struggled to **scale sovereign digital infrastructure**.  
This is less about capacity than about **policy decisions, procurement culture, and Treasury logics**.  

---

## Policy Timeline (2000–2025)  

- **2000s (New Labour)**  
  - Target culture entrenched (KPIs, central dashboards).  
  - Outsourcing expanded (Capita, Serco, Atos as go-to vendors).  
  - “Transformational Government” strategy emphasised centralisation.  

- **2010–2015 (Coalition)**  
  - **Austerity**: cuts to public IT and R&D budgets.  
  - **Government Digital Service (GDS)** founded (2011) — initial sovereignty push.  
  - Procurement reforms opened space for SMEs, but scale remained limited.  

- **2016–2019**  
  - **Brexit** consumed political oxygen.  
  - IPA 2016 entrenched surveillance/metadata retention powers.  
  - UKRI and Innovate UK grants expanded research, not operational builds.  

- **2020–2022 (COVID era)**  
  - Emergency procurement norms entrenched.  
  - Palantir entered NHS with £1 contract → scaled rapidly.  
  - Domestic firms sidelined by “speed and assurance” arguments.  

- **2023–2025**  
  - NHS Federated Data Platform awarded to Palantir.  
  - Ministry of Justice deepens outsourcing for prison/court IT.  
  - Labour government continues KPI dashboards → centralisation + foreign vendor reliance persists.  

---

## Structural Themes  

- **Talent exists**: Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, London clusters; NHS informatics.  
- **Resource allocation skewed**: R&D grants vs. operational funding.  
- **Procurement culture**: Treasury risk-aversion = default to multinationals.  
- **Scaling gap**: UK startups rarely reach contract size required for state platforms.  

---

## Possible Shifts  

- **Align procurement with sovereignty goals**.  
- **Scale grants into operational build-outs**.  
- **Embed OKR-style measurement** to replace KPI-driven centralisation.  
- Could build sovereign systems in 1–2 years with political will.
