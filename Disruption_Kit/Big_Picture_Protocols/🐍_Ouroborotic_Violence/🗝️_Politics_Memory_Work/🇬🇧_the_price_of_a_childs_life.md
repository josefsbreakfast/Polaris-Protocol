## 🛰️ Orientation

This node confronts a question that British institutions have repeatedly answered without ever stating aloud:

**What is the acceptable cost of harming a child?**

Across policing, healthcare, defence, migration, and safeguarding systems, that cost has too often been calculated in:
- reputational damage,
- political inconvenience,
- legal exposure,
- or administrative burden,

rather than in **human terms**.

This node exists to state plainly:  
that calculation is illegitimate.

## 🧭 How the price gets set (without being named)

The price of a child’s life is rarely declared.  
It is inferred through choices:

- silence instead of disclosure,  
- classification instead of safeguarding,  
- delay instead of repair,  
- procedure instead of care.

Each delay says:
> *This harm is tolerable for now.*

Each deflection says:
> *The cost of action is higher than the cost to the child.*

---

## 🧿 What gets counted — and what doesn’t

Institutions are very good at counting:
- financial liability,
- ministerial risk,
- media fallout,
- operational disruption.

They are consistently bad at counting:
- stolen futures,
- developmental harm,
- lifelong instability,
- moral injury,
- decades lost to containment or disbelief.

When only the first set is counted, the outcome is preordained.

---

## 🕰️ Time as an amplifier of cost

Harm to a child does not stay fixed.

Over time it:
- compounds,
- migrates across systems,
- reshapes identity,
- and consumes adulthood.

What might have been repairable early becomes catastrophic later.

The longer the state waits, the higher the true price climbs — even as institutions pretend it is depreciating.

---

## 🛑 The false economy of silence

Silence is often justified as:
- “buying time”,
- “avoiding escalation”,
- or “protecting stability”.

In reality, silence is the most expensive option.

It:
- multiplies victims,
- deepens liability,
- corrodes trust,
- and guarantees future reckoning.

There is no discount for delay.

## ⚖️ Why law cannot legitimise this trade

No secrecy law, public interest test, or risk assessment:
- authorises the sacrifice of a child,
- permits indefinite harm,
- or converts moral failure into compliance.

Where legal frameworks are used to excuse such outcomes, the failure is not legal complexity.

It is **ethical abdication**.

---

## 🧠 What this question forces into view

Asking “the price of a child’s life” exposes the lie at the centre of institutional harm:

That some losses can be absorbed quietly.

They cannot.

Every system that chooses reputation over repair is not managing risk.  
It is **spending a human life**.

---

## 🛠️ What the only acceptable answer is

The only legitimate answer to this question is:

**There is no acceptable price.**

Not for:
- political comfort,
- institutional continuity,
- national embarrassment,
- or elite protection.

Anything else is not governance.

It is abandonment.

*🇬🇧 The Price of a Child’s Life* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It names the moral failure that underlies repeated institutional harm: the attempt to calculate an acceptable cost for a child’s suffering.
