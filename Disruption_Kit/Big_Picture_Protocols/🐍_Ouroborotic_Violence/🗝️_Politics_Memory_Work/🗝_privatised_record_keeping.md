# 🗝 Privatised Record Keeping  
**First created:** 2025-09-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*How public records are quietly rerouted into private custody, enclosing survivor histories behind contractual and commercial secrecy.*

---

## 🧩 Overview  

Privatised record keeping is the silent twin of state secrecy.  
What once sat within Freedom of Information scope now hides inside *commercial confidence* clauses.  
Survivor-relevant archives — from safeguarding reviews to mental-health assessments and institutional complaint files — migrate into private data vaults operated by law firms, consultants, or “partner agencies.”  

Each migration weakens collective memory and erodes accountability.  
The effect is not simply *outsourcing* but *memory enclosure*: a systemic rerouting of public evidence into zones where scrutiny becomes a tort risk rather than a right.

## 🧮 Mechanisms of Enclosure  

1. **Procurement Firewalls**  
   - Contracts designate the private contractor as the “data controller,” placing survivor records beyond FOI.  
   - Review boards cite “commercial sensitivity” to block release of material that once would have been public.  

2. **Law-Firm Laundering**  
   - Sensitive inquiries are channelled through legal consultancies.  
   - Attorney–client privilege becomes a shield against disclosure even when public money funds the work.  

3. **Sub-Platform Custody**  
   - Cloud storage and “case-management” portals store survivor evidence under proprietary licence.  
   - Data-retention terms and jurisdictional routing (often offshore) make recovery almost impossible.  

4. **Sealed Metadata Chains**  
   - Audit trails are stripped on export or written into non-searchable PDF layers.  
   - Version history — the proof of how narratives were shaped — is deleted or paywalled.

## 🧭 Implications for Survivor Access  

- Survivors lose *ownership of their own timelines*: the right to see, correct, or contextualise the record.  
- Journalists and advocates face prohibitive legal costs to obtain evidence.  
- Historical research into institutional abuse becomes legally hazardous.  

This converts *trauma data* into an **asset class** — traded, redacted, and indexed for risk rather than justice.

---

## 🧰 Counter-Responses  

- **Audit the Custody Chain:** demand disclosure of every entity that has ever held survivor data.  
- **Insert Public-Interest Clauses:** future contracts must guarantee FOI and subject-access rights.  
- **Build Shadow Archives:** where lawful, duplicate survivor evidence into collective, non-commercial repositories.  
- **Expose the Language Drift:** document where “privacy” or “security” rhetoric conceals profit-driven opacity.

*🗝 Privatised Record Keeping* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how **outsourcing and legal privilege** reshape access to truth, enclosing survivor histories within profit logic and contract law — and outlines counter-responses to reclaim public memory.
