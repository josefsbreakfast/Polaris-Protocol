# 🪻 Who Died For Your Vote?  
**First created:** 2025-12-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-23  
*Remembering the women whose imprisonment, starvation, and deaths secured democratic rights in Britain.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node documents the **material cost of women’s suffrage in Britain**, focusing on those who were imprisoned, force-fed, injured, and killed. It exists to counter the sanitised version of suffrage history that celebrates symbols while erasing sacrifice.

Democracy was not granted.  
It was extracted — at bodily cost.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Suffrage as a struggle involving imprisonment and death  
- Hunger strikes as deliberate resistance, not martyrdom theatre  
- Violent resistance contextualised, not erased  
- Posthumous honour vs lived cruelty  

---

## ⚰️ Women Who Died Without Vindication  
Several suffragette women died as a result of:
- force-feeding injuries,
- hunger strikes,
- imprisonment-related illness,
- and violent state response.

Many did not live to see:
- partial suffrage in 1918,
- or equal suffrage in 1928.

They died branded as:
- criminals,
- extremists,
- hysterics,
- threats to public order.

They were not promised statues.

## 🔥 Resistance Beyond Respectability  
The suffrage movement included:
- arson attacks on property,
- sabotage of communications infrastructure,
- bomb attacks targeting symbols of power (not civilians),
- and at least one attempted attack on the Prime Minister’s residence.

This militancy emerged **after decades of lawful exclusion**.

To erase this is to rewrite history into obedience.

## 🕊️ Posthumous Praise As Moral Laundering  
The women of the suffrage movement are now celebrated precisely because:
- they are no longer disruptive,
- their methods can be disavowed,
- their deaths can be reframed as tragic but necessary.

This is not honour.  
It is narrative containment.

---

## 🕯️ Why This Still Matters  
When modern hunger strikers are mocked, dismissed, or left to starve, the same logic is being replayed:
- bodily sacrifice is tolerated only after death,
- democracy is celebrated only once secured,
- and resistance is legitimate only in hindsight.

It restores historical accuracy where sanitisation has replaced truth.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
