## 📣 What they demanded of others

- **Extreme resilience:** soldiers, detainees, and civilians were expected to withstand bombing campaigns, detention, and interrogation pressure.
- **Silence under secrecy:** people bound by Official Secrets Act or MoD paperwork were told to “absorb” violations without complaint.
- **Sacrifice as duty:** the rhetoric of “national security” justified personal suffering and rights erosion as “the price of freedom.”
- **Public stoicism:** communities (esp. Muslim, migrant, and working-class groups) were told to accept heightened policing, surveillance, and stigma.

## 🧍 What they’d actually tolerate themselves

- **Physical vulnerability:** most had never been near a battlefield or cell; even a non-restraint arrest (hands behind back, no violence) would reduce them to fear and humiliation.
- **Reputation anxiety:** personal image in media mattered far more to them than personal endurance. A single headline about discomfort could trigger full-scale defensive spin.
- **Comfort-first politics:** they operated from ministerial offices, chauffeured cars, media studios — very far from the conditions they normalised for others.
- **Zero tolerance for disruption:** even being heckled at a conference, or facing a protest outside their home, provoked disproportionate outrage.

## 🔄 The Gap (Projection & Fragility)

- **Projected toughness:** talked as if they embodied Churchillian grit.
- **Reality check:** structurally insulated, rarely exposed to the conditions they authorised.
- **Fragility exposed:** the idea of restraint, interrogation, or forced endurance was unbearable for them — yet they sanctioned it against civilians, soldiers, and detainees.
