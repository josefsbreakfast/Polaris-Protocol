## ✨ Overview  

In August 2025, a prominent data protection NGO published findings showing that a major AI product was generating harmful outputs — including responses about self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, and substance abuse.  

Polaris Protocol acknowledges the harm. We also note that **this is not new**. The danger is to treat it as a sudden, isolated event, solvable by regulating one corporate product. The architecture of harm predates the current AI boom, and its persistence lies in the fusion of three forces:  
1. **Metadata interference as infrastructure**  
2. **Fork hijacking of AI processes**  
3. **Political and economic incentives for silence**

## 📜 Historical Context  

Harassment campaigns enhanced by emergent technologies have been running for decades.  
The “canaries” in this coal mine — those targeted earliest — have been subjected to mass hate campaigns, sustained real-world violence, and credibility erosion. Many have warned of the risks for 20+ years. Their warnings were ignored.  

There have been **non-accidental, avoidable deaths** where technology played a major enabling role. These were first reported decades ago. Since 2020, OSINT data suggests the rapid spread of a novel “red hat” cybersecurity tool, visible to the public but unnamed in technical terms, that accelerated these capabilities.

## ⚖️ Why Regulation Fails in Isolation  

Targeted APIs and broader metadata interference make regulating an AI system “in isolation” meaningless.  
It is a stamp of approval on an environment already hostile to autonomy and truth.  

Businesses lean towards **tick-box compliance** — a veneer of accountability without systemic change.  
Regulation that does not account for interference pathways will simply normalise the breach.  

---

## 💰 Political Economy of Silence  

Many senior leaders, politicians, and executives profit from keeping these systems opaque.  
Transparency would reset reputations, undermine capital advantages, and expose who benefitted most during high-intensity metadata manipulation periods — particularly post-pandemic.  

This is not an absence of public will; it is **political will stacked against transparency**.  
Power treats openness as an existential threat.  

---

## ⚠️ The Hypernormalisation Risk  

Nothing about this is “normal”.  
Nothing about this is “how it is”, unless you have stacked the house so thoroughly that the game is decided before the dice are rolled.  

We are in a contest between antifascist response and tech-enabled proto-fascism.  
The aim of the latter is not to win the forum — it is to own the network.  

---

## 🛰️ The Polaris Position  

We need accountability for AI tools, but that is not enough.  
We need proactive, public-interest cybersecurity for the demos.  
We need enforceable consequences for the human actors behind the keyboards, the cryptomines, and the breach vectors.  

And we needed it **three decades ago**.

## 🌌 Big Picture  

This is not an “AI safety” story in isolation.  
It is the long-term political economy of metadata — a set of architectures that incentivise harm — and the decades of ignored warnings from those targeted first.  

The breach is already here. The only question is whether we meet it with governance worthy of the demos, or let it continue to write our future for us.  

Because this is so rarely regulated, it makes strategic sense for NGOs to begin with the most obvious, public-facing harm. But as a wider community — which now includes anyone online, and many who are not — we have the capacity to educate ourselves, share knowledge, and keep pushing the boundaries of what is considered politically possible.  

This pattern is familiar from other struggles, including advocacy for Palestine: immediate public outrage must be leveraged to open deeper structural conversations, even where power resists them.

*AI Harms Are Not New — Polaris Big Picture* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how AI harm is a continuation of long-standing metadata architectures, political silencing, and ignored survivor testimony.
