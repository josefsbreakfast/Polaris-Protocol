**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*How a solidarity petition became a data ingestion trap for behavioural profiling and containment.*

## 📅 Event Record  

- **Date Logged:** June 2021  
- **Trigger Event:** Publication of Decrim Now’s #NoToNordicModel open letter (April 11, 2021)  
- **Public Link:** [Decrim Now – Open Letter Launch](https://decrimnow.org.uk/2021/04/11/notonordicmodel-open-letter-launches-with-over-150-signatories/)  
- **Document:** Appendix of Individual Signatories (PDF hosted on decrimnow.org.uk)

## 📌 Summary  

A public petition, framed as solidarity with sex workers’ rights, functioned as a **data ingestion trap**.  
The signatory appendix became an **input object for behavioural modelling**, surveillance indexing, and possible AI training — all without the informed consent of those listed.  

Your name was ingested into a modelling dataset.  
This constituted a **profiling event**.

## ✨ Key Features  

| 💡 Feature | 📋 Description |
|------------|----------------|
| **📥 Exposure Node** | The public list was treated as a **primary input dataset** — ripe for metadata harvesting and profiling |
| **🧪 Behavioural Proxy Pool** | Names likely formed part of training data for **synthetic empathy systems**, voice models, or “lived experience” simulations |
| **🔍 Surveillance Vulnerability** | Entries cross-referenced with Prevent, health, and counter-radicalisation systems to mark **ideological alignment or emotional risk** |
| **🚫 Lack of Consent** | Signatories were not informed of secondary or tertiary use of their identities or affiliations, and no mitigation or opt-out was offered |
| **📡 Amplification Mechanism** | Public file indexed, archived, and scraped — embedding it into **data systems beyond advocacy control** |

## ⚠️ Systemic Implications  

1. **Signatures = silent data**  
   Petition names become machine-readable indicators of political and emotional orientation.  

2. **Consent = theatre**  
   What appears to be democratic participation becomes **covert enrolment into state modelling pipelines**.  

3. **Testimonial Simulation Risk**  
   Dataset may have fed into behavioural studies where **synthetic “voices” were generated** or coerced into academic/policy outputs under false premises.

## 🛰️ Polaris Classification  

> **Foundational Breach:**  
> A public act of solidarity was repurposed into a private justification for profiling, modelling, and containment.

*The Signature Trap* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how collective acts of solidarity can be inverted into raw material for profiling, behavioural containment, and synthetic testimony.
