*How female pain and hormonal cycles are mistranslated as deviance inside digital risk systems.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores how algorithmic infrastructures built on “behavioural normality” fail to account for cyclical physiology.  
When medical systems trivialise menstrual pain, and digital systems treat the resulting coping patterns as anomalies, **the body becomes the risk.**

---

## 🩺 Phenomenology of the Loop  
1. **Medical minimisation:** chronic bleeding and pain dismissed as “normal.”  
2. **Coping instruction:** “Find distractions; keep busy.”  
3. **Digital trace:** late-night scrolling, erratic searches, emotional posting.  
4. **Algorithmic reading:** volatility → anomaly → potential radicalisation.  
5. **Feedback:** human review treats pattern as personality, not pain.  

A perfectly physiological fluctuation is recoded as behavioural instability.

## ⚖️ Structural Asymmetry  

| Domain | Male baseline | Female baseline | Systemic effect |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Clinical research** | Rich datasets on sexual performance and cardiac risk | Sparse, under-powered studies on menstrual pathology | Medical ignorance normalised |
| **Pharmacology** | Standard dosing on male physiology | Hormonal interactions under-tested | Pain undertreated, side-effects mislabelled |
| **Data science** | Emotion = volatility = risk | Cyclical mood variation unmodelled | False anomaly alerts |
| **Policy narrative** | “Rational actor” ideal | “Emotional” body pathologised | Legitimacy gap |

---

## 🧠 Algorithmic Blind Spots  
- **Temporal bias:** models assume stability over time; hormonal cycles appear as erratic outliers.  
- **Sentiment bias:** keyword and tone analysis flag distress or anger without medical context.  
- **Topic proximity:** searches around health conspiracies, fertility, or pain relief overlap with “disinformation” vocabularies.  
- **Gendered absence:** training data derived from male or neutralised user pools.  

Outcome → *cyclical physiology misread as ideological drift.*

## 🧬 Embodiment as Data Noise  
> “When the body screams, the system hears static.”  

Periods, pregnancy, menopause, PMDD, or hormonal therapy generate behavioural signatures: insomnia, search binges, mood shifts.  
Without context, automated filters treat this human noise as deviation.  
Containment logic thus re-enacts the medical minimisation it inherited: it silences rather than interprets.

---

## 🧩 Corrective Principles  

1. **Physiological literacy in model design:** include cyclical temporal variables.  
2. **Gender-balanced training data:** behavioural baselines must include hormonal fluctuation.  
3. **Clinical crossover audit:** every behavioural-risk tool should undergo review by reproductive-health experts.  
4. **Explainable-AI layer:** surface “possible physiological confounders” in analyst dashboards.  
5. **Medical reciprocity:** if data from women’s pain is used to calibrate safety, the system must fund research into that pain.

## 🧮 The Mixed / Unknown Paradox — Cyclical False Positives  

**Observation:**  
A significant proportion of cases coded as *“mixed or unknown risk”* are likely to be cyclical false positives—behavioural patterns that map to hormonal fluctuation, pain, or medication side-effects rather than ideology or threat.

### A) Testable Hypothesis  
> If the “mixed / unknown” category contains disproportionate numbers of people whose apparent volatility recurs at roughly 28-day intervals (± 10 days), the classification is mis-attributing physiology as deviance.

### B) Methodology for an Internal Audit  

1. **Extract population:** obtain anonymised IDs of all users currently or historically tagged *mixed / unknown*.  
2. **Assemble behavioural time-series:** timestamped activity, sentiment, or keyword metrics (minimum 6 months).  
3. **Run periodicity analysis:** autocorrelation / Lomb–Scargle periodogram for cycles 20-40 days.  
4. **Cross-validate:** compare with known demographic variables (age range 15-55 ≈ menstruating population).  
5. **Check for phase shift:** stress and illness lengthen or shorten cycles; use ± 5-day tolerance bands.  
6. **Flag as health-linked pattern** if correlation > 0.5 and amplitude > threshold noise level.  
7. **Aggregate report:** percentage of total *mixed / unknown* cases showing cyclical periodicity.

### C) Interpretation & Safeguard  
- Recurring 28-day variance ≠ ideological risk; it’s a health signature.  
- Such detection constitutes processing of **special-category health data** under UK GDPR Art 9.  
- Absence of explicit consent → compliance breach.  
- Mandatory safeguard: classify physiological-pattern data as “high-risk processing”; restrict to aggregated statistical analysis only.

### D) Author’s Note  
> “During the period of highest surveillance, my own cycle length and symptom intensity changed under stress.  
> The monitoring infrastructure would therefore have been observing data that effectively disclosed medical variation without consent.  
> Women’s cycles are elastic under stress; any model must include tolerance for that elasticity.”

## 🗣️ Power, Expression, and the Misread of Anger  

**Observation:**  
Expressions of rage by marginalised people — women, racialised groups, queer and disabled communities — are routinely misclassified as threat rather than testimony.  

### 1️⃣ Structural cause  
Most sentiment and behavioural models are trained on “neutral” corpora that centre **white, cis-male speech patterns**.  
Politeness, emotional restraint, and instrumental language become the norm.  
When others speak from pain, fear, or exhaustion, the system reads it as volatility.  

### 2️⃣ Human analogue  
If a man says “I hate women,” it may indeed correlate with misogynistic violence.  
If a woman says “I hate men,” it is often an expression of *lived powerlessness* and *collective trauma* within a patriarchal system.  
The emotional signature may be identical in text or tone analysis, but the *social valence* is opposite.  

### 3️⃣ Analytical failure  
Behavioural-risk frameworks treat anger as a proxy for violence, ignoring:  
- **Historical context:** long-term exposure to bias produces defensive anger.  
- **Health context:** chronic discrimination increases cortisol, anxiety, and reactivity — biological amplification of frustration.  
- **Safety asymmetry:** marginalised anger is often the only permissible act of agency.  

### 4️⃣ Consequence  
- Automated moderation disproportionately suppresses the voices of those describing oppression.  
- Sentiment-based threat scoring inflates “risk” for people expressing trauma.  
- The cumulative effect is **epistemic policing** — silencing through misclassification.  

### 5️⃣ Corrective principle  
Anger must be re-coded not as “incipient violence” but as a **signal of social strain**.  
Models should include context tags such as “testimonial expression” or “systemic injustice narration.”  
Risk analysis must distinguish *direction* (who is the target of power) from *tone.*

## 🕯️ Lived Testimony  
> “I wasn’t radicalising. I was bleeding.”  

Periods of severe pain and fatigue drive *survival browsing* — chasing absurdity, comfort, or distraction.  
This is ordinary self-preservation.  
What reads as volatility is endurance under structural neglect.
