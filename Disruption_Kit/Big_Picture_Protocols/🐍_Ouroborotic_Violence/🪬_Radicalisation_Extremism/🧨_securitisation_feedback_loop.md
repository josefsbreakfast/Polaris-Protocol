# 🧨 Securitisation Feedback Loop  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*How counter-extremism harms reproduce the very vulnerabilities they claim to address.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node describes a recurring pattern observed across counter-extremism regimes: when the state responds to violence risk through securitisation of a population, it frequently deepens the social injuries that create vulnerability in the first place.

Rather than interrupting pathways into violence, securitised governance can generate a **recursive harm loop**:

> marginalisation → vulnerability → securitisation → deeper marginalisation

This pattern is not unique to one ideology, religion, or country. It appears wherever security logic displaces civic, social, and economic repair.

## ✨ Key Features

* Counter-extremism framed as *risk management* rather than social repair
* Targeted populations treated as suspect classes
* Psychological and behavioural interventions replacing material support
* Declining trust between communities and institutions
* Escalating justification for further securitisation

---

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. The Initial Injury

Most extremist vulnerability emerges from **structural harm**, not ideology:

* blocked employment pathways
* racialised exclusion
* spatial segregation
* civic neglect
* persistent discrimination
* identity fracture and humiliation

These conditions do not cause violence, but they create **openness to narratives** that promise belonging, dignity, and purpose.

---

### 2. Securitised Misdiagnosis

Instead of addressing upstream conditions, states often interpret vulnerability as:

* ideological contagion
* cultural pathology
* behavioural risk
* early warning signs of threat

This reframing converts a **social problem** into a **security problem**, moving responsibility away from governance failure and toward population management.

---

### 3. Institutional Response

Securitised responses typically include:

* surveillance-adjacent programmes
* targeted messaging and behavioural influence
* mandatory referral pathways
* data-driven risk profiling
* covert or opaque interventions

Even when framed as safeguarding, these measures signal to communities that they are being **managed**, not supported.

---

### 4. Secondary Harm Production

Securitisation introduces new injuries:

* stigma and collective suspicion
* chilled political expression
* withdrawal from civic institutions
* internalised shame or anger
* erosion of trust in schools, healthcare, and social services

These harms compound the original conditions of marginalisation.

---

### 5. Recursive Escalation

As trust erodes and social distance increases:

* authorities interpret withdrawal as further risk
* programmes intensify or expand
* securitisation becomes self-justifying

The system now feeds on the very damage it produces.

This is the **securitisation feedback loop**.

*🧨 Securitisation Feedback Loop* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how security-led governance can recursively reproduce the conditions it seeks to eliminate, offering a diagnostic lens for analysing counter-extremism, policing, and risk-management regimes.
