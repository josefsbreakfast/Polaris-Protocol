*Mid-2010s conditions as an “open host” for disinformation to evolve like a pathogen.*

## 🧭 Sketch  

In the mid-2010s, a perfect set of conditions aligned for large-scale, fast-mutating disinformation:

- Platforms at global scale but **no mature moderation or slow-down mechanisms**.  
- **Cheap compute and ad buys** meant a few thousand dollars could reach millions.  
- A **funding climate** obsessed with “growth hacking” and “move fast.”  
- **No shared immune system** — no public literacy in meme-war tactics, no cross-platform norms.  
- **Multiple actors with incentives** — PR firms, political campaigns, ideologues, trolls, intelligence services. They didn’t have to coordinate; they only had to push at once.

Result:  
A digital ecosystem ripe for “fuck-around-and-find-out” experimentation. Each exploit became a template. The manipulative content evolved like a virus, faster than any regulatory or journalistic response.  

No Bond villain required — just an **open host environment**.

*🦠 Opportunistic Disinformation Pathogen* is a stub node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records an emergent framing of the mid-2010s as a “pathogen moment” for disinformation, where conditions not masterminds drove escalation.
