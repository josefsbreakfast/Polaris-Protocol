# 🪦 Memory Erasure in Radicalisation  
**First created:** 2025-09-12  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*On how collective forgetting and scandal laundering create the conditions for radicalisation.*

---

## Purpose
To trace how **amnesia is engineered**—through media cycles, institutional rewriting, and algorithmic decay—so that discredited ideologies and actors can return unchallenged.  
This node studies forgetting as infrastructure: a system that clears runway for the next wave of extremism by erasing the last.

---

## Core Premise
Radicalisation thrives not only on outrage but on **absence of remembered context**.  
When public memory resets, continuity of harm disappears, and each re-emergence feels like a new crisis instead of a repetition.  
Erasure is therefore both defence mechanism and recruitment strategy: it cleans the archive so that lies can start fresh.

## Mechanisms of Forgetting
| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Narrative Laundering** | Reframing past scandals as misunderstandings or resolved controversies. |
| **Archival Attrition** | Link rot, de-indexing, or algorithmic demotion of inconvenient histories. |
| **Generational Reset** | Shifts in platform or media form separating new audiences from prior evidence. |
| **Institutional Rebranding** | Dissolved organisations reappearing under new acronyms or leadership. |
| **Selective Commemoration** | Memorialisation of victims without accounting for perpetrators or systems. |

## Analytical Questions
1. What disappears first: evidence, context, or emotion?  
2. Which institutions curate forgetting under the banner of reconciliation?  
3. How do algorithms decide which histories to resurface?  
4. What moral economies reward selective remembrance?  
5. Where are survivors in the new narratives—quoted, tokenised, or missing entirely?

## Indicators of Erasure
- Recurrence of identical policy proposals despite past failures.  
- Public surprise at events with clear historical precedent.  
- Archival articles unlinked but still hosted on servers.  
- Sudden shifts in official terminology (e.g., “reform” → “reset”).  
- Survivors or whistleblowers disappearing from citations.

---

## Research Threads
- Mapping “memory holes” in press coverage over five-year cycles.  
- Tracking domain re-registrations of defunct extremist organisations.  
- Analysing algorithmic weighting of historical vs current scandal keywords.  
- Oral histories from journalists, archivists, and survivors of erasure.  
- Comparative study: state-managed forgetting vs community-led healing.

## Future Expansion
Will connect within **🪬 Radicalisation & Extremism** to:
- **📣 Mainstream Visibility Gaps** – how coverage flickers out before accountability.  
- **🧾 Rehabilitation Ops** – redemption as a weaponised form of forgetting.  
- **🧨 Spectacle of Raids** – distraction cycles that overwrite systemic memory.

## 🏮 Footer
Every radicalisation begins with a blank page someone else has scrubbed clean.  
This node listens for what was meant to stay buried.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
