# 🧠 Far Right Feeders Flipbook  
**First created:** 2025-08-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Timeline of how data harvesting and opportunistic networks fed far-right ascendancy in the Anglophone sphere.*  

---

## 🌐 Overview  
This flipbook documents the **feeders** that sustained far-right ascendancy from 2010s to 2020s.  
It traces how fragmented datasets (sex work, MOD laptops, Cambridge Analytica) converged with geopolitical opportunism (Russia, Five Eyes laundering, Brexit), and how decentralised networks exploited those pipelines.  

---

## 🕰 Timeline of Feeders  

### 📂 Pre-2016 – Datasets in Waiting  
- **MOD laptop leaks** → “data zombies” tagged under OSA, individuals unprotected, exploitable.  
- **Sex worker datasets** → phone sex scripts, cam prompts harvested for emotional/erotic registers.  
- **Right-wing think-tanks** → Project Esther / US foundations laying groundwork.  
- **Russian bot culture** → LiveJournal networks, early farmed influence operations.  

### 🗳 2016 – Brexit as Engineered Pivot  
- Sudden mainstreaming of “should we leave” narrative.  
- Brexit campaign turbo-charged with harvested datasets + nudge infrastructure.  
- Permission structure created: if “Leave” can be normalised, any far-right project can.  

### 📉 2018 – Cambridge Analytica Collapse  
- CA goes defunct, but demand for psyops doesn’t.  
- Infrastructure laundered via universities (Oxford sandbox, Cambridge spin-outs).  
- Authoritarianism researchers tapped under “lucky timing.”  
- Quasi-MOD/Home Office projects seeded, half-in/half-out of state.  

### 👁️‍🗨️ Post-2018 – Embedded Operations  
- **Prevent overlap** → cluster logic repurposed into radicalisation risk.  
- **Judiciary interference** → rungs between regional and national controllers, invisible to the public.  
- **Cabinet-adjacent nudges** → pressure off policing, far-right under-investigated.  
- **Five Eyes laundering** → shared bad data + contaminated “safety” frameworks.  

### 🌍 Parallel Players  
- **Russia** → mastery of information warfare, treated as sovereign domain.  
- **China** → patient strategy, letting West burn itself out.  
- **Anglophone elites** → cultural prestige of Oxford/Cambridge weaponised for cover.

## 🧮 Comparison Matrix  

| **Feeder** | **Mechanism** | **Output** | **Signature Risk** |
|------------|---------------|------------|--------------------|
| MOD laptop leaks | Data zombies under OSA | Exploitable, unprotected individuals | No legal recourse |
| Sex work datasets | Harvested erotic/emotional scripts | Mockery & infantilisation psyops | Survivor re-traumatisation |
| Cambridge Analytica | OCEAN psychometrics | Brexit nudges, CA collapse laundering | Academic sandbox grift |
| Prevent / CVE | Cluster logic repurposed | Risk-pathologisation of dissent | “Unreliable narrator” trope |
| Five Eyes | Shared metadata laundering | Contaminated “safety” frameworks | International opacity |
| Russia / China | Opportunistic mirrors | Amplified discord & decay | Sovereign info-warfare |
| Anglophone elites | Oxford/Cambridge prestige | Cultural cover for ops | Legitimacy laundering |

## 🧬 Forensic Signatures  
- **Infantilisation & mockery** → lifted from sex work / kink service scripts.  
- **Zombie tagging** → OSA datasets exploited, no recourse for targets.  
- **Nudge culture** → Brexit as proof-of-concept for manufactured “public opinion.”  
- **Cluster shorthand** → repurposed DSM triage → discredit dissent.  
- **Unattended ops** → fantasy of automation, collapse of nuance.

## ⚖️ Key Takeaway  
Far-right ascendancy was not spontaneous.  
It was fed by **datasets**, **sandboxes**, and **networks** that converged across 2016–2018.  

- **Brexit**: the engineered opinion pivot.  
- **CA collapse**: laundering into academia.  
- **Five Eyes**: laundering into “safety.”  
- **Russia/China**: opportunistic mirrors.  
- **Now**: decentralised right-wing tissue embedded in mid-tier governance.
