# 🪜 Upstream Prevention Models

**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12
*Evidence-based approaches that reduce extremist vulnerability by strengthening belonging, dignity, and life pathways — rather than policing identity or belief.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node documents **upstream prevention models**: interventions that reduce vulnerability to extremist recruitment by repairing social conditions before violence risk emerges.

Across international research, the most effective prevention strategies are not security-led. They are **civic, economic, social, and relational**, focused on restoring belonging, opportunity, and trust.

Upstream models work precisely because they address **social injury**, not ideology.

## ✨ Key Features

* Prevention rooted in inclusion rather than suspicion
* Investment in people rather than surveillance
* Universal provision over targeted securitisation
* Community-led design and delivery
* Long-term resilience rather than short-term optics

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. Community Cohesion and Cross-Group Contact

Strong evidence shows that sustained, meaningful contact across groups:

* reduces fear and stereotyping
* increases empathy and social trust
* weakens us-versus-them narratives

Effective models include:

* shared civic projects
* mixed-group youth programmes
* arts, sports, and cultural infrastructure
* local decision-making forums

Cohesion is not messaging; it is **shared experience**.

---

### 2. Youth Opportunity and Pathways

Youth vulnerability rises sharply when futures feel blocked.

Protective interventions include:

* apprenticeships and paid training
* clear routes from education to employment
* mentoring and sponsorship
* recognition of informal skills

Where young people can imagine a future, extremist narratives lose urgency.

---

### 3. Anti-Discrimination Enforcement

Everyday discrimination corrodes belonging.

Evidence-based prevention requires:

* robust enforcement of equality law
* accountability for discriminatory policing or hiring
* accessible reporting mechanisms
* visible consequences for institutional bias

Fair treatment is not symbolic — it is preventative.

---

### 4. Mental-Health and Trauma Support

Many vulnerable individuals carry:

* unaddressed trauma
* depression or anxiety
* identity-related stress
* intergenerational harm

Accessible, culturally competent mental-health care:

* reduces isolation
* interrupts grievance escalation
* restores self-worth

Care is a security intervention.

---

### 5. Safe Political Expression

Extremist movements thrive where legitimate dissent feels impossible.

Upstream models protect:

* freedom to criticise government
* space for political anger without punishment
* non-violent routes to influence

Democracy itself is a protective factor.
