*How economic alignment with authoritarian regimes creates systemic blind spots and accelerates fascist capture.*

## 🌐 Core Thesis  
Capitalism, as an economic system, is structurally agnostic: it prioritises profit over rights or ideology.  
Left unchecked, capital gravitates toward authoritarian actors who promise stability, order, and deregulation.  

This produces a **structural appeasement loop**:  
- Economic elites normalise authoritarianism because it serves their bottom line.  
- Authoritarians gain legitimacy and resources, entrenching their power.  
- Counter-extremism frameworks underplay the danger, because the rhetoric of “stability” mirrors conservative values.

## ⚙️ Mechanisms of Appeasement  
1. **Profit Alignment** – Capital rewards deregulation and suppression of labour.  
2. **Narrative Camouflage** – Authoritarians speak the language of security, order, and growth.  
3. **Blind Spot Creation** – Shared vocabulary disarms scrutiny from centre-right observers.  
4. **Accelerant Effect** – Authoritarian regimes are easier business partners than pluralist democracies.

## 📚 Historical Context and Limits of Appeasement  
In the 1930s, European leaders faced a regime combining industrial capacity, propaganda, and totalitarian control at scale.  
Appeasement had rational appeal after WWI carnage — many saw it as a way to “buy time.”  

Yet the economic benefits proved catastrophically short-term:  
- Enabled German rearmament and expansion.  
- UK and France ceded industrial advantage.  
- Britain’s empire weakened irreversibly (loss of Raj, challenged dominance in North Africa & Middle East).  

**Outcome:** appeasement accelerated Britain’s decline and left it devastated in WWII.

## 🕳️ Asymmetry of Recognition  
- Authoritarian expansion abroad (e.g. Russia under Putin) is recognised as dangerous.  
- Similar behaviours at home or by allies are reframed as pragmatic or necessary.  
- This asymmetry blinds publics to authoritarian consolidation inside “friendly” regimes.  
- **Recognition must be behaviour-centred, not adversary-centred.**

## 📈 Strategic Implications  
- **Hearts-and-minds appeals fail**: profit-driven actors ignore moral persuasion.  
- **Anti-fascist strategy must name capital**: leaving economics out keeps resistance weak.  
- **International precedent**: appeasement lessons from the 1930s apply today, accelerated by digital economies.
