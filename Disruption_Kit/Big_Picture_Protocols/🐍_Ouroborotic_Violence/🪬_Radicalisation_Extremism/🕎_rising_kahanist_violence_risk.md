# 🕎 Rising Kahanist Violence Risk  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Mapping the re-emergence of Kahanist ideology and its convergence with global alt-right networks as a threat logic toward Jewish diaspora communities.*

---

## 📖 Definition  

This node analyses the **re-emergent Kahanist ideological current**—a militant form of Jewish ethno-nationalism descended from the thought of Meir Kahane—and its interaction with global alt-right movements.  
It explores how Kahanist, messianic, and utilitarian doctrines cross-pollinate with contemporary nationalist extremisms, and how this convergence produces risk not only to non-Jews but to Jewish diaspora communities themselves.  

---

## 🧩 Ideological Lineage  

Kahanism arose in the late twentieth century as a doctrine of **“muscular Judaism.”**  Its founder, *Meir Kahane*, rejected the quietist ethos of rabbinic tradition, advocating exclusive Jewish sovereignty and the pre-emptive use of violence to secure it.  
The slogan *“Never Again”* in this register meant *“Never Again for us.”*  
Kahanist and messianic insignia resurfaced after October 2023 around IDF-linked training programmes and diaspora activism, signalling the exploitation of an extremist narrative rather than a purely religious revival.

## ⚔️ Political Utilitarianism and Violence Rationales  

Some nationalist doctrines treat the security and continuity of the nation-state as the overriding moral imperative.  In those frames, individual safety can become instrumental to collective survival—a logic that can normalise extreme measures in the name of preserving the polity.  
Contemporary echoes of this rationale are visible in debates around doctrines such as the controversial *“Hannibal Directive”* (a contested Israeli military policy discussed openly since October 7 2023) and in the revival of Kahanist rhetoric.  
Within such logics, diaspora fear can be mobilised or monetised, and punitive responses framed as necessary corrections after a loss of control.

## 🌐 Cross-Pollination with Global Alt-Right Movements  

Since the early 2000s, online networks have enabled constant cross-pollination between nationalist and supremacist ideologies.  
The same digital pipelines that radicalised the western alt-right now circulate through Jewish and Christian-Zionist spheres, normalising a style of **state-worshipping ethno-nationalism** that treats the nation itself as sacred.  
Violent acts that mimic neo-Nazi imagery may arise not from antisemitism but from its inversion: an extremist conviction that safeguarding *Am Yisrael* (the people) or *Medinat Yisrael* (the state) justifies any measure, even self-directed harm.  
This is a form of **colonial mimicry**—borrowing twentieth-century European nation-state logic, where state continuity outweighs individual worth—and helps explain why some ultra-nationalist currents mirror the aesthetics and methods of the very movements they claim to oppose.

## 🧭 Behavioural Commonalities & Prevention  

Across ostensibly different ideological frames — Kahanist, alt-right, Islamist, or other ethno-nationalist currents — the same cluster of behaviours, vulnerabilities and recruitment dynamics recur.  
Young men (and other disproportionately targeted cohorts) are radicalised through social isolation, identity-threat narratives, online pipeline grooming, grievance amplification, and group rites that normalise violence.  
The ideological content (the story they tell themselves about who matters and why) changes the symbols and enemies, but not the underlying psychosocial drivers.  
Consequently, prevention and deradicalisation strategies that work for one stream (community interventions, counter-narratives, psychological support, disruption of grooming networks) are broadly transferable; gaps appear when institutions categorise threats by identity rather than by mechanism.  
Recognising this cross-ideological commonality allows authorities and communities to build unified, mechanism-focused prevention frameworks rather than siloed, identity-bound responses.

## 🧱 Institutional Blind Spot — UK Counter-Terror Context  

The UK counter-terrorism architecture (Prevent, Channel, CONTEST) maintains categories for *Islamist*, *far-right*, and *mixed or unclear* ideologies, but none for Jewish nationalist or Kahanist violence.  
Jewish identity is treated solely as a **target group**, never as a potential **perpetrator identity**.  
This omission leaves no analytic lane, training module or risk-assessment framework for extremism emerging from within Jewish nationalist or diaspora-defence narratives.  
Incidents of this nature would likely be subsumed under “far-right” or “unclear motivation” classifications, obscuring both their ideological origin and their prevention lessons.

## 🧭 Accountability and the “Innocence Trap”  

A persistent trope in many white Western circles since 1945 has been the idea that Jewish people, because of the Holocaust, “cannot” be perpetrators of harm.  What presents itself as protection often functions as erasure: it denies Jews the same moral and legal accountability expected of any other people and dehumanises them by refusing to see them as capable of both good and evil.  
This *innocence trap* flattens Jewish political diversity and feeds the global difficulty in naming or analysing Jewish extremism.  When support for Palestinian liberation is met only with invocations of the Holocaust, it exposes an unexamined belief that Jewish violence is unthinkable and Jewish responsibility impossible.  Every human group is capable of radicalisation; refusing to see that capacity in ourselves is what allows extremism to incubate unchallenged.

## ✡️ Philo-Semitism as the Mirror of Anti-Jewish Bigotry  

The idea that Jews are uniquely clever, moral, or gifted with money is often framed as admiration, yet it springs from the same root as anti-Jewish hatred.  
**Philo-semitism** and **anti-semitism** are a single double-sided coin: both mark Jews as fundamentally *other.*  
The term *anti-semitism* itself was coined by people who hated Jews; the “philo-semitic” trope was their polite disguise.  
When Western culture praises Jews as exceptional—too clever, too ethical, too persecuted to ever do wrong—it performs the same dehumanisation as open hatred.  
These “good” stereotypes make Jewish wrongdoing unthinkable and Jewish accountability impossible.  
Every compliment carries its recoil: *“clever with money”* becomes *“manipulative,”* *“chosen”* becomes *“clannish.”*  
To challenge anti-Jewish bigotry we must dismantle its flattering half as well as its hostile half.  As Shylock reminds us, *“If you prick us, do we not bleed?”*  Humanity, not exceptionality, is what restores equality.

## 🇮🇱 Diaspora Politics and the Likud Legacy  

Recent events should not surprise anyone familiar with the political lineage.  Amichai Chikli, current Israeli Minister for Diaspora Affairs and member of the Likud party, treats world Jewry—including British Jews—as part of a single “risk portfolio.”  In practice, that means every Jew abroad is imagined as a node of responsibility for Israel’s image and security, regardless of personal belief or connection to the state.

Likud itself was founded in the 1970s after the Yom Kippur War and has consistently represented an expansionist, settler-colonial strain of Zionism.  Since the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the collapse of the Oslo Accords, Likud’s crisis politics have dominated Israeli governance, intertwining national security with U.S. imperial interests.  By 2023–25, Kahanist and messianic symbols were appearing openly within IDF units and diaspora activism—a fusion of religious nationalism and global alt-right aesthetics.

When Chikli invites figures such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (Tommy Robinson) into dialogue, he is not creating a new alliance but revealing an old ideological convergence.  This mirrors the long pattern of Likud leaders sharing stages with far-right or Holocaust-revisionist figures while claiming to defend Jews from antisemitism.

For British Jews, this has concrete consequences.  Diaspora Jews become extensions of Israeli policy without consent, expected to defend actions that many find indefensible.  Supporting such politics in the name of fighting antisemitism is philosemitism in its most dangerous form: the belief that Jewish safety can only be purchased through the harm of others.

As Baroness Warsi has argued publicly, genuine emancipation and equality in Britain require confronting these alignments.  Solidarity means rejecting both antisemitism and its mirror image, the uncritical worship of Jewish power.  History is calling; the test is whether British society—and British Jews—can meet it.

*Rising Kahanist Violence Risk* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol.**  
It documents the ideological and psychological structures through which extremist logics emerge inside and adjacent to Jewish nationalist thought, and how those logics intersect with global alt-right movements to endanger diaspora communities.
