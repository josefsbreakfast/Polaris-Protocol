# 🕊️ False Counter-Extremism Dialogues  
**First created:** 2025-09-12  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*On Prevent-style programmes that simulate “community engagement” while embedding surveillance and narrative control.*

---

## Purpose
To catalogue and decode state-sponsored or NGO-framed “dialogues” that claim to prevent radicalisation but primarily function as **information-harvesting and compliance-conditioning mechanisms**.  
These programmes construct the illusion of conversation while mapping trust networks and identifying dissent for early containment.

---

## Typical Signatures
- Invitations framed as *listening exercises* or *bridge-building*.  
- Heavy use of wellbeing and cohesion language masking intelligence objectives.  
- Presence of third-party facilitators with undisclosed state contracts.  
- Selective inclusion of “approved” community representatives.  
- Event outputs reported as qualitative data for Prevent metrics or safeguarding audits.  
- Media amplification emphasising harmony while omitting grievances voiced.  

---

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Who funds or accredits the organisers?  
2. Where are participant lists stored, and under what legal basis?  
3. Are disclosures during sessions treated as consented data?  
4. Which agencies receive post-event summaries or “risk profiles”?  
5. What becomes of participants labelled “resistant” or “non-constructive”?  

---

## Research Threads
- Comparative analysis of Prevent and overseas counter-radicalisation frameworks.  
- Ethnographic accounts from participants who withdrew or refused consent.  
- Document tracing: procurement records, charity filings, and subcontracting chains.  
- Linguistic audit of policy language (e.g. *resilience*, *vulnerability*, *partnership*).  
- Mapping crossover between safeguarding teams and counter-terror portfolios.

## Future Expansion
This node will grow into a full **Big Picture Protocol** within  
🪬 *Radicalisation & Extremism*, linking to:
- **Policy genealogy** — how Prevent evolved from community policing to datafication.  
- **Ethics of engagement** — distinguishing dialogue from data capture.  
- **Survivor counter-narratives** — reclaiming voice within securitised space.

## 🏮 Footer
This node marks the quiet places where conversation was offered in exchange for silence.  
It listens for what was never meant to be said aloud.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
