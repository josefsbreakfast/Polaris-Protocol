# 🔮 Future Faking  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*How “future-faking” (promises of elevated status, mentorship, intimacy or opportunity) originated in interpersonal abuse and pick-up culture, migrated through manosphere grifts, and is now used as a recruitment vector into extremist movements.*  

---

## 🧩 Core Pattern  

“Demonstrating high value” is a performed promise: a sender projects a desirable future (status, belonging, sexual/romantic reward, or political significance) to induce trust, investment, and obedience.  

- **Future-faking** — explicit or implicit promises of an imminent reward or belonging that are never delivered.  
- **Status projection** — staged social proof (photos, selective endorsements, luxury cues) to signal being “high value.”  
- **Scarcity & laddering** — access or status is made scarce, gated by rites/loyalty that require increasing investment.  
- **Mentorship grooming** — the promise of guidance, insider knowledge, or practical help to bind recruits to a leader or group.  
- **Looped re-promise** — when a promised reward fails, the recruiter offers a new horizon (re-promise), keeping recruits engaged.  

---

## 🧾 Examples  

- **Pick-up artist / PUA playbooks** — future-faking as a dating tactic: promise of intimacy or upgrade in status to gain compliance or sexual access.  
- **Manosphere / MGTOW grifts** — promises of “alpha” status, economic liberation, or brotherhood that require monetary or emotional investment.  
- **Far-right / extremist recruitment** — staged narratives of belonging, glory, or purpose (e.g., “become part of a movement that will restore X”) used to bring in lonely or disaffected men.  
- **Cults & millenarian groups** — false-event horizons (failed raptures, postponed utopias) that reset devotion on each non-event.  
- **MLM / “get-rich” funnels** — multi-level marketing schemes that promise rapid financial elevation through tiered membership, while deliverables never materialise.  
- **Online influencer economies** — curated lifestyle signals sold as achievable through particular products, courses, or membership tiers.  

---

## 🗣 Discussion  

This tactic matters because it translates interpersonal abuse into organised mobilisation.  

- **Scalable grooming** — techniques that began in 1:1 manipulation (romantic or cultic) are amplified by online platforms, algorithms and influencer economies.  
- **Intersectional harms** — these tactics disproportionately target socially isolated, economically precarious, or emotionally vulnerable men; they also reproduce gendered power dynamics.  
- **Moral economy of belonging** — the recruit’s investment (time, money, social capital) creates sunk costs that make exit harder when promises fail.  
- **Normalization** — as these tactics migrate into mainstream political/narrative spaces they become legitimised as “mentorship” or “self-improvement.”  

---

## 🧭 Mechanisms (how it works)  

1. **Signal construction** — create staged evidence of success (photos, testimonials, curated metrics).  
2. **Promise framing** — offer a near-future reward (status, access, belonging).  
3. **Small initial ask** — request a low-cost favour or commitment to build trust.  
4. **MLM-style laddering** — staged tiers of paid membership or affiliate rewards that convert recruits into recruiters, multiplying sunk costs.  
5. **Escalation path** — escalate asks (deeper loyalty, money, exclusivity).  
6. **Failure + reframe** — when the reward fails, reframe it (blame external forces, promise a new horizon).  
7. **Entrapment** — sunk costs, social consequences, shame or ostracism make exit costly.  

### Sales Funnels as Future-Faking  

Predatory sales funnels rely structurally on future-faking. Each tier promises that the *next step* will deliver transformation — but the promised outcome is always deferred.  

- **Entry lure** — low-cost product or “free” advice as a hook.  
- **Future promise** — assurance that the next tier (course, subscription, investment) is where the real breakthrough lies.  
- **Escalating asks** — higher payments, more time investment, tighter loyalty requirements.  
- **Deferred delivery** — outcomes are perpetually postponed, keeping the buyer moving forward instead of exiting.  

👉 The funnel itself is a **looped re-promise machine**: a structural guarantee that the buyer will never arrive, only advance.  

### Radicalisation Funnels  

Extremist recruitment operates on the same sales-funnel logic as MLMs or influencer grifts:  

- **Entry lure** — open promises of belonging, mentorship, or “brotherhood.”  
- **Future promise** — assurance that the next stage (private chat, study circle, direct action group) holds deeper meaning or higher status.  
- **Escalating asks** — greater time commitment, ideological conformity, sometimes financial contributions.  
- **Deferred delivery** — the “glorious future” (victory, restored nation, divine approval) never arrives, but the horizon keeps being reset.  

👉 Extremism functions as a **political sales funnel**: a system of escalating re-promises that binds recruits tighter even as the promised future remains out of reach.  

### High-Control Groups & Cults  

Future-faking is not just a sales tactic — it is the architecture of high-control groups.  

- **Deferred horizons** — cults promise rapture, revelation, or transformation that is always postponed.  
- **Figurehead grifters** — a charismatic leader monopolises the power to re-promise, binding followers closer after each failure.  
- **Nested funnels** — initiation paths mirror sales funnels: free teachings → private circles → escalating demands → ultimate sacrifice.  
- **Radicalisation link** — extremist movements replicate this structure: offering belonging and purpose, then continually deferring the “glorious future” to keep recruits invested.  
- **Beyond money** — Not all extraction is financial. Some figureheads prize attention, obedience, or loyalty above cash. Followers’ time, devotion, and compliance become the currency. What matters is not whether outsiders value it, but that the figurehead values it — and structures the funnel around harvesting it.  

👉 Whether cult, MLM, manosphere grift, or extremist cell, the skeleton is the same: a high-control system built on endless re-promises.

## ⚖️ Law & Grey Zones (UK context)  

- **Pyramid schemes** — explicitly illegal since the 1980s (after scams like the “airplane game”).  
- **Multi-level marketing (MLM)** — legal if a product/service is sold and participants can demonstrate profit.  
- **Grey zone** — in practice, most participants lose money, but companies shift blame (“you didn’t work hard enough,” “you didn’t believe in the product”).  
- **Litigation chill** — MLM firms are often highly litigious, shutting down criticism before it accumulates into regulatory pressure. Survivors of financial coercion are left isolated.  
- **Post-pandemic growth** — financial precarity created fertile ground; recruitment surged in online spaces such as **Clubhouse (2020)**, where MLM sellers and crypto evangelists converged.  

👉 This legal ambiguity enables **future-faking at scale**: systemic promises of wealth and status that rarely materialise, but continue to extract time, money, and loyalty.

## 🌐 Pandemic Surge (2020)  

The COVID-19 pandemic created ideal conditions for large-scale future-faking grifts:  

- **Economic precarity** — sudden layoffs, furlough at 75%, and no rent/mortgage forgiveness left millions financially exposed.  
- **Online captivity** — with populations confined at home, new platforms like **Clubhouse** became recruitment zones.  
- **Grifter convergence** — MLM sellers, crypto evangelists, NFT hawkers, and “hustle” influencers occupied the same chatrooms, cross-selling futures of wealth and status.  
- **Altcoin explosion** — beyond Dogecoin, dozens of “altcoins” promised rapid riches; NFTs flourished as supposed assets of the future.  
- **Stimulus ideology** — governments urged spending to “stimulate the economy,” a message interpreted very differently across classes:  
  - Wealthy actors consolidated and hedged.  
  - Poorer citizens were nudged into speculative capitalism, carrying the highest risks.  

👉 Pandemic-era platforms normalised a culture of **promised futures that never arrived** — scaling up interpersonal future-faking into mass financial manipulation.

## 🩸 Crisis Exploits  

Future-faking flourishes in moments of desperation.  

- **Pandemic desperation** — people cashed in life savings or even parents’ mortgages chasing “double your money” promises. Against mass death and political conspiracy, the pull of certainty was immense.  
- **Snake-oil continuity** — wellness and “miracle cure” industries recycle the same tactic. Identify vulnerability (illness, grief, post-birth changes), promise a wholesome solution, bypass informed consent. Harms can be severe (e.g., porous vaginal products → infection, toxic shock).  
- **Podcast-bro supplements** — men are sold powders and pills by influencers whose physiques rely on steroids and extreme regimes, not the advertised product. Marketing scripts use loops: “give it a few more weeks,” “stack with this,” “results take time.” When outcomes fail, blame shifts to the buyer.  
- **Cross-gender exploitation** — While often discussed as men exploiting women in dating, future-faking is equally used by men against men — hustlers, MLM uplines, crypto grifters. The skeleton is the same: promise → delay → re-promise → loss.  

👉 Crisis amplifies exploitation. Future-faking is not niche behaviour — it is a generalised architecture of abuse that thrives wherever urgency and desperation make promises irresistible.

## 🗂 Harms & Indicators  

**Harms:** radicalisation, financial loss, social isolation, psychological harm, compounding of gendered violence.  

**Indicators for practitioners/researchers:**  
- Frequent talk of an imminent “breakthrough” or “release” that never manifests.  
- Rigid laddering of status access (tiers, paid membership, private channels).  
- Cultish language about “brotherhood”, “calibration”, or “elite”.  
- Repeated re-promises after missed deliverables.  
- Emotional dependency on a charismatic leader or mentor.  
- **Rapid monetisation / pyramid ladders** — presence of tiered paid access, “affiliate” incentives, or referral rewards designed primarily to recruit other paid members rather than deliver a product or service.  

---

## 🛡 Mitigations & Countermeasures  

- **Prebunking & education** — teach emotional literacy on grooming, future-faking, and manipulative persuasion.  
- **Platform interventions** — detect patterns of staged social proof and gate paid “mentorship” funnels that have predatory features.  
- **Financial protections** — flag rapid monetisation funnels and require transparent refund/withdrawal mechanisms.  
- **Peer exit supports** — provide exit networks that reduce social costs of leaving (safe channels, peer accompaniment).  
- **Consumer protection & platform rules** — require platforms to flag and limit predatory multi-level monetisation funnels, ban false wealth claims, and mandate disclosure of success rates.  
- **Regulatory action** — require transparent claims for paid mentorship products and make deceptive “get rich/elite” claims actionable.

## 🔍 Analysis  

Future-faking is not “just a dating trick.”  

- **Gendered entry point** — Normalised first in PUA culture as a way to manipulate women by promising intimacy or status.  
- **Migration to male targets** — The same tactic now targets men directly: promises of mentorship, brotherhood, or financial freedom that never materialise.  
- **Pandemic escalation** — From MLM funnels to crypto/NFT waves, millions of men lost savings by trusting the same behaviours they once excused in interpersonal contexts.  
- **Shared skeleton** — Whether for sex, loyalty, or money, the structure is the same: promise → delay → re-promise → loss.  

👉 What is tolerated as “game” in private becomes the same technique that strips assets in public. Future-faking is not niche; it is a **generalised architecture of exploitation**.
