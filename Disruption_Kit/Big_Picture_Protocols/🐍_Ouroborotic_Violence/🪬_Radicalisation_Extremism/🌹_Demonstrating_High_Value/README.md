*From pick-up artist boast to political masculinity grievance.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
“Demonstrating Higher Value” (DHV) is a cornerstone of pick-up artist (PUA) rhetoric.  
It instructs men to showcase their supposed uniqueness and superiority as a lure — making themselves appear rare, elevated, or enviable.  

What begins as a dating tactic translates seamlessly into political masculinities: movements built on constant claims of exception, grievance, and superiority over the imagined “average man.”  

---

## 🔑 In the PUA World  
- **Definition:** Showcase traits that mark you as “better” than other men.  
- **Tactics:** bragging stories, pre-selected social proof, false scarcity, peacocking (flashy dress).  
- **Function:** Convince women they’re lucky to be chosen by you, while other men are inferior.

## 🪬 Political Masculinity Afterlife  
- **From Bar to Nation:** Instead of “not like other guys,” far-right figures proclaim “not like weak men / not like the West.”  
- **Recruitment Logic:** Group uniqueness becomes proof of destiny and superiority.  
- **Weaponised Scarcity:** Women, safety, even civilisation itself are framed as scarce prizes only “real men” can defend.  

---

## 🧨 Continuity & Harm  
- **Inflated Self-Narrative:** DHV normalises narcissism as survival strategy.  
- **Othering:** Always requires positioning others as “low value” to make the self look high.  
- **Pipeline Role:** Provides a readymade vocabulary of grievance and specialness — exactly what extremist recruiters exploit.

*Demonstrating Higher Value* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It tracks how a PUA tactic of self-aggrandisement mutates into political grievance masculinities.
