# 🪬 PUA to Far-Right Pipeline  
**First created:** 2025-09-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*How pick-up artist subcultures seeded the rhetorical and behavioural DNA of far-right political masculinities.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Pick-up artist (PUA) forums and manuals weren’t just about dating.  
They were laboratories of dominance, humiliation, and control.  

The same vocabulary and logics later re-emerged as the scaffolding for far-right political masculinities: grievance-driven, obsessed with hierarchy, and willing to spill over into violence.

## 📊 Table of Lineages  

| **PUA Term** | **Original Use** | **Far-Right Adaptation** | **Continuity / Why It Matters** |  
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|  
| **DHV (Demonstrating Higher Value)** | Signal uniqueness, superiority over “average” men to attract women | Claim uniqueness over “weak men” or the “decadent West” | Recruitment hook through grievance & exceptionalism |  
| **Neg / Negging** | Backhanded compliment to destabilise a woman | Ironic racism, trolling, insult memes | Cruelty normalised as a dominance tactic |  
| **AMOG (Alpha Male of Group)** | Out-compete rivals in bars / clubs | Dominate rallies, digital spaces, political streets | Masculinity equated with public violence |  
| **AFC (Average Frustrated Chump)** | Shorthand for loser men without “game” | “Normies,” NPCs, “cucks” | Outsider shaming as boundary work |  
| **Red Pill** | See through feminism and female choice | Awakening to conspiracy, authoritarian ideology | Radicalisation metaphor transfers seamlessly |  
| **HB (Hot Babe) scale** | Women rated numerically by looks | Hierarchies of racialised/sexualised value | Women treated as symbolic property of group |  
| **Kino Escalation** | Step-by-step escalation of touch | Step-by-step escalation of extremist violence | Normalising incremental boundary-breaking |  
| **Frame Control** | Keep control of conversation & perception | Shape political narrative, dominate media trolling | Power is framed as control over perception itself |

## 🧩 Why It Matters  
- PUAs trained men to treat social life as *manipulable systems*.  
- The manosphere became a proving ground for grievance masculinities.  
- Today’s far-right draws directly on that inheritance: it’s not new, it’s recycled abuse scripts at scale.
