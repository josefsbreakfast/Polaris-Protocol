*Exaggerated self-display as a demonstration of high value in PUA and extremist recruitment scripts.*

## 🌱 Scope  

Peacocking is a tactic in pickup artistry (PUA) and adjacent radicalisation cultures.  
It involves deliberate, often absurd, self-display — clothing, props, speech, or behaviour —  
to force social attention and signal supposed “high value.”  

What begins as coloured hats and loud shirts in PUA handbooks  
becomes a transferable logic in extremist milieus:  
loud provocation to test who looks, who laughs, who stays close.  

---

## 🦚 Definition  

- **PUA origin:** Neil Strauss’s *The Game* (2005) popularised the term.  
- **Behavioural tactic:** Dress or act in a way that *violates norms* to draw notice.  
- **Signal logic:** Creates a forced asymmetry — “I am the one you are all noticing.”  
- **Recruitment adaptation:** Converts into group tests — chanting, banner drops, or meme floods — where spectacle functions as proof of status.  

---

## 🎭 Mechanisms  

- **Disruption of baseline:** Noise, costume, or props alter the usual flow of space.  
- **Attention hijack:** Anyone responding validates the peacock’s supposed social dominance.  
- **Group sorting:** Those amused or attracted are funnelled closer; those resistant are dismissed as irrelevant.  
- **Pipeline overlap:** Shared with marketing “shockvertising” and extremist meme warfare.

## 🧩 Links to Radicalisation  

- Early PUA → “Red Pill” forums → far-right influencers.  
- The lesson: control the gaze. If you can engineer who looks, you can engineer who stays.  
- Extremist groups scale peacocking to mass media: marches, uniforms, provocative flags, or slogans.

## 🪖 Uniforms as Peacocking  

The line from pickup artistry to political uniforms is straighter than it looks.  
PUA handbooks said: *“Wear something that makes people look.”*  
Fascist street movements applied the same logic: *“Dress alike so the street looks at us.”*  

- **Alt-right polos & khakis** — borrowed “everyman” uniform to stage mass belonging.  
- **Tiki torches (Charlottesville 2017)** — props as peacock feathers, engineered for TV.  
- **Paramilitary cosplay** — camouflage, tactical vests, insignia that exaggerate “warrior” value.  
- **Black Bloc** — inverse tactic: sameness + anonymity as the uniform that dominates the gaze.  

Uniform peacocking magnifies status display into **collective spectacle**.  
What was once “notice me” becomes “notice *us* — and fear or follow.”

## 🧪 Extension — The Alchemist’s Peacock’s Tail  

There’s another peacock worth mentioning — the one the alchemists saw.  
When matter has been broken down completely, it blooms again in iridescent colour:  
the *cauda pavonis*, the Peacock’s Tail.  

That moment meant something precise — **transformation through multiplicity**.  
It wasn’t about performance; it was about perception.  
Light refracted through what used to be opaque.  

Where “peacocking” sells the costume, the alchemist’s tail tells a different story:  
that the human being is a prism, not a prop.  

For thousands of years, men sang, embroidered, cooked, wept, and philosophised.  
Then work culture — imperial, industrial, uniformed — told them  
to wear the same grey suit and express nothing.  
The spectacle replaced the spectrum.  

Reclaiming the Peacock’s Tail is not about dressing louder.  
It’s about remembering you contain more colours than you’re permitted to show.  
It’s about building depth rather than props — curiosity instead of costume.  

**Don’t fall for a fake. Get a real Peacock’s Tail.**

## 🏮 Footer  

*🦚 Peacocking* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the tactic of exaggerated self-display as a throughline from pickup artistry  
to radicalisation, extremist uniforms, and collective spectacle,  
and reframes it through the alchemist’s Peacock’s Tail — as an invitation to multiplicity instead of mimicry.
