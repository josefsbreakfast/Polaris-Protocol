# 🧠 Fascism as Scaled Coercive Control  
**First created:** 2025-11-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-26  
*Fascism is not “charisma” or ideology — it is coercive control expanded from the household to the state.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node reframes fascism through the lens of **abuse psychology**, not political theory.  
It is a survivor-coded analysis showing how authoritarian systems replicate the exact tools used by coercive partners, cult leaders, and manipulative interpersonal actors — just scaled to millions of people and enforced by law.

This perspective matters because people leaving far-right ecosystems often blame themselves for “falling for it.”  
This node clarifies: **coercive systems work by design. You were targeted, not defective.**

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Fascism mirrors the **behavioural cycles of abusers**: love-bombing, isolation, dependency, punishment.  
- What media calls “charisma” is actually **push–pull manipulation** and **threat-coded emotional engineering**.  
- Radicalisation resembles **trauma bonding**, not ideological conversion.  
- Fascist states weaponise humans’ **ancestral attachment systems** to create loyalty.  
- The correct counterframe is **exit from coercion**, not “changing beliefs.”

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Fascism is not an ideology — it is a *method*  
Traditional political science treats fascism like a coherent ideology.  
Survivor logic says:  
**“It’s coercive control, but with a government budget.”**

Patterns shared between abusers and fascist leaders:

- monopolising your attention  
- controlling information  
- reframing reality  
- isolating you from support  
- punishing autonomy  
- rewarding dependency  
- inducing fear of outsiders  
- eroding self-trust  
- collapsing identity  
- creating cycles of relief and threat  

This is not charisma.  
This is **emotional capture**.

---

### 2. “Charisma” is just coercion with good lighting  
Media mythologises fascist leaders as “magnetic.”  
Survivor analysis recognises:

- mirroring  
- negging  
- intermittent reinforcement  
- guilt–relief cycles  
- exclusivity framing  
- wound-targeting  
- shame manipulation  

Their so-called “charisma” is indistinguishable from:

- pickup artists  
- cult recruiters  
- narcissistic partners  

It is *performed attunement*, not attraction.  
The affective signal is:  
**“only I see you — and only I can fix you.”**

---

### 3. Fascists hijack human attachment wiring  
Humans have ancient vulnerabilities:

- longing for belonging  
- fear of exclusion  
- craving for recognition  
- instinct to mimic the group  
- desire for meaning and cohesion  

Fascists **hotwire** these systems — like someone stealing a car with a screwdriver.  
They don’t create the engine.  
They bypass the safety mechanisms.

This is why:

- intelligent people  
- neurodivergent people  
- isolated men  
- traumatised people  
- new immigrants  
- young people seeking identity  

…are all recruitable.

This is not weakness.  
This is **humanity**.

---

### 4. Isolation is the architecture  
Abusers say:  
“Everyone else is against you.”

Fascists say:  
“The elites hate you. The left hates you. Your neighbours are traitors.”

The emotional outcome is the same:

- terror of leaving  
- belief that no other community will accept you  
- distorted expectations of the outside world  
- fear of humiliation  
- fear of judgement  
- the sense that exit = exile  

This is why deradicalisation must be **community-based**, not punitive.

---

### 5. Fascist governance is the scale-up of abuser logic  
Every private tool of the coercive partner becomes a public tool of the state:

| Abuser tactic              | Fascist analogue                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Isolate partner            | Censor press / break unions          |
| Control finances           | Freeze assets / austerity            |
| Surveillance of partner    | State spying / informant culture     |
| Gaslighting                | Propaganda / historical revisionism  |
| Punishment for autonomy    | Police violence / purges             |
| Love-bombing repentance    | Nationalist rallies / exceptionalism |

Fascism is **DARVO with a flag**.

---

### 6. Leaving fascism feels like leaving an abusive relationship  
People exiting extremist spaces experience:

- shame  
- confusion  
- disorientation  
- inability to self-trust  
- fear of outside judgement  
- grief for the identity they were given  
- emotional withdrawal  
- craving for the certainty the abuser supplied  

This is not ideological churn.  
This is **attachment repair**.

This is why survivor-coded leftists are more effective deradicalisers than institutional liberals.
