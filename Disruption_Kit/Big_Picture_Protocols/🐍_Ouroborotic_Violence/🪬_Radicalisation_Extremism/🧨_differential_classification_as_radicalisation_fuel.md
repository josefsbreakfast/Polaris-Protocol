# 🧨 Differential Classification as Radicalisation Fuel  
**First created:** 2025-10-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Unequal terrorism designations as a driver of radicalisation and public confusion.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node documents how inconsistent classification of ideologically motivated violence—mosque arsons, synagogue stabbings, gurdwara assaults—actively undermines counter-extremism goals.  
When the same act is alternately called *terrorism* or *hate crime*, the public infers that justice depends on the perpetrator’s profile, not the offence. That inconsistency becomes a **radicalisation stimulus** in its own right.

## 🔍 Analysis  

1. **Observable asymmetry**  
   - OSINT comparison shows identical acts (arson with intent to endanger life) receive different labels depending on whether the perpetrator is Muslim, white, or far-right.  
   - Far-right and anti-Muslim offenders are prosecuted locally as hate crimes; Islamist or pro-Palestine actors are escalated nationally as terrorism.  

2. **Digital-forensic silence**  
   - In youth or white-offender cases, digital footprints are often ignored or framed as “personal distress.”  
   - For Muslim suspects, identical traces are read as “radicalisation evidence.”  
   - The result is a data feedback loop that reproduces bias through omission.  

3. **Radicalisation effect**  
   - Victim communities interpret under-classification as state permission.  
   - Perpetrator communities interpret it as state indulgence.  
   - Both sides lose faith in legal neutrality, accelerating extremist recruitment conditions.  

4. **Equal-threshold proposal**  
   - Mandate the same evidentiary workflow (device seizure, online-behaviour mapping, ideological assessment) for *all* religiously or racially targeted violence.  
   - Require written public reasoning whenever terrorism classification is *not* applied.

*Differential Classification as Radicalisation Fuel* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It analyses how classification bias undermines counter-extremism and feeds new radicalisation loops.
