# 🩺 Frankenstack Intake & Response Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-10-05  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*A clinician-style playbook for recognising, documenting, and de-escalating stack-induced dysregulation — and introducing the concept to the public, safely.*  

---

## 🔍 What This Is (and Isn’t)  
This is a **history-taking + response protocol** for suspected **Frankenstack exposure** — i.e. hybrid, dual/multi-use behavioural systems (CT / safeguarding / health + commercial recommender stacks) acting on a person and their social field.  
It is **not** diagnosis or treatment guidance; it provides **common language + structure** so survivors, supporters, researchers, and practitioners can see the same picture.  

---

## 1️⃣ IDENTIFY — Structured History-Taking  
Ask as if compiling a clinical or psychosocial history, but for **systemic entanglement** rather than symptoms.  

**Domains:**  
- **Timeline of exposure:** when digital, institutional, or interpersonal feedback loops first appeared.  
- **Stack vectors:** CT-adjacent interventions, algorithmic recommenders, biometric or ID enrolments.  
- **Social mirroring:** sudden group or relational shifts that follow data or media interventions.  
- **Physiological cues:** sleep disturbance, sensory overload, panic spikes around platform use.  
- **Containment patterns:** how help-seeking, visibility, or public speech get redirected or delayed.  

---

## 2️⃣ INTERPRET — Differential Mapping  
Map against known **Frankenstack composites:**  
- Safeguarding × Counter-terrorism (Prevent logic).  
- Mental-health × Platform moderation.  
- Research × Commercial UX optimisation.  
- Charity × Data-broker funding chains.  

**Red flags:** feedback loops that reproduce distress as data, convert testimony to “risk,” or create circular referrals.  

---

## 3️⃣ RESPOND — Immediate Stabilisation  
- **Name it aloud.** Recognition reduces derealisation.  
- **Ground physically.** De-stack by re-anchoring in body + environment.  
- **Slow the loop.** Introduce latency (pause app refreshes, delay replies, disable push notifications).  
- **Record precisely.** Timestamped field log entries, screenshots, and witness notes.  
- **Counter-script gently.** Refuse forced gratitude or moral-compliance cues.

### 🗣️ Conversational Ethics — Socratic Method & Motivational Interviewing  

Both **Socratic questioning** and **Motivational Interviewing (MI)** model *non-directive curiosity*.  
They don’t force compliance; they **surface reasoning and consent** within the survivor’s own frame.  
In Frankenstack contexts, this conversational stance is a **de-escalation technology** — it slows capture, restores agency, and reduces institutional moral injury.  

> KPI-driven behaviour correction burns out trust and staff alike.  
> OKR-framed dialogue (“understand X”, “build consent loops”, “reduce coercion footprints”) is **cheaper long-term**, because it sustains rapport rather than churn.  

**Translation for systems:**  
- *KPI logic* = extractive (measures output).  
- *OKR logic* = relational (measures direction).  
- When exposure to Frankenstack harm is high, **shifting from KPI to OKR is the lowest-cost stabilisation intervention available.**  

---

## 4️⃣ REFER — Safe Escalation Paths  
- Survivors → trusted peers / research collectives / legal observers.  
- Practitioners → multidisciplinary ethics panels, not disciplinary reporting routes.  
- Researchers → independent IRB equivalents for digital systems harm.  

---

## 5️⃣ EDUCATE — Introducing the Concept Publicly  
When describing Frankenstack to a wider audience:  
- Avoid diagnostic framing; emphasise *structural exposure*.  
- Use analogies (e.g. “stacked feedback loop,” “algorithmic over-reach,” “data tinnitus”).  
- Anchor in ethics, not pathology.  
- Keep survivor tone: calm, lucid, boundary-aware.
