# 🧟‍♀️ Frankenstack Radicalisation Hypothesis  
**First created:** 2025-10-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Hybrid stacks as dual/multi-use engines that can tip fear into violence.*

## 🧟‍♀️ What a Frankenstack Really Is  
A **Frankenstack** is not one system but a *way of assembling* systems.  
It takes tools built for one purpose (counter-extremism, safeguarding, wellbeing, recommender engines) and **repurposes them in fusion**.  
Each part is defensible in isolation; the hybrid becomes a live experiment without oversight.

This is **dual-use theory applied to behavioural infrastructure**.  
There will never be “one” Frankenstack — there are many, each stitched for a different policy or commercial goal.

## 🔁 Why This Matters for Radicalisation  
Many acts of violence in the past 10–15 years show a pattern:
- **No violent history**, but sudden **fear-driven action**.  
- **Anger + panic** at a perceived emergency that no one is addressing.  
- **Conspiracy logic** providing a sense of mission or revelation.  

This is a distinct psychiatric picture — historically rare outside cults or psychotic breaks.  
Online it appears more frequently, at greater scale, and with faster onset.

## ⚗ Stack-Induced Breakdown  
Frankenstacks magnify stressors already present in society:
- Rising inequality, permanent war footing, institutional distrust.  
- Short-form, high-velocity content eroding temporal grounding.  
- “Safety” nudges and surveillance loops that mimic coercive control.  

All that’s required is a **small additional push** from a hybrid stack — a nudge, ranking tweak, or synthetic social cue — to convert chronic fear into acute breakdown.  
The result reads like “AI-induced psychosis” or “algorithmic entrainment,” but it is better described as **stack-induced dysregulation**.

## 🧠 Dual / Multi-Use Lens  
Thinking in dual-use terms helps:
- Frankenstacks = not one conspiracy but a *class of repurposing practices*.  
- Radicalisation = sometimes an *emergent property* of these practices, not simply bad actors + bad ideas.

*🧟‍♀️ Frankenstack Radicalisation Hypothesis* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It extends *The Frankenstack Problem* into the radicalisation domain, showing how hybridised safeguarding–CT infrastructures can push already stressed populations into breakdown and violence.
