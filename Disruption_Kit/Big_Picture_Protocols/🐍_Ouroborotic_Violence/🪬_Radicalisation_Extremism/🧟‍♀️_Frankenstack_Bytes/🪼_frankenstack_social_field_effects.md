# 🪼 Frankenstack Social Field Effects  
**First created:** 2025-10-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Hybrid stacks not only modulate individuals but also destabilise their networks — using excitability and inhibition at scale.*

## 🧟‍♀️ Beyond the Individual  
A **Frankenstack** is not just a personal feed or a “bad algorithm.”  
Because it fuses multiple systems (CT, safeguarding, mental-health apps, recommender engines) it can also act on the **social field** around a person — friends, family, supporters, solidarity groups.

This is the **second-order effect**:
- Break up personal relationships.
- Sow discord and suspicion between allies.
- Individualise divide-and-conquer tactics at scale because the underlying delivery is cyber-forensic and automated.

## ⚡️ Excitability vs 💤 Inhibition  

| Mode (stack) | Neurological term | Everyday term | Visible social effects |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Excitability** | Increased neuronal excitability | Agitation / amplification | Heightened anger, grandiosity, hyperfixation, paranoia, impulsive action; network fractures through bursts of outrage |
| **Inhibition** | Increased neuronal inhibition | Sedation / demotivation | Fatigue, demoralisation, withdrawal, catatonia, suicidality; networks lose momentum and solidarity |

Both modes are primitive but effective.  
They only need to nudge already stressed systems to produce large effects.

## 🧠 Hypothesis Stream 1 — **Identify**  
We need a more anthropological/clinical history-taking of:
- What individuals were actually seeing on their devices in the run-up to events.
- What micro-interventions or nudges they experienced.
- How their sensory data streams (feeds, notifications, synthetic social cues) shifted over time.

At present, neither media narratives nor open research capture this layer.  
Counter-terrorism may collect it covertly, but not in ways that inform public understanding or safeguards.

## 🩺 Hypothesis Stream 2 — **Manage**  
Understanding this sensory violation as a **poisoning-analogue** helps:
- When sensory expectations are repeatedly violated (machine behaves unpredictably), the body produces defensive states — nausea, dizziness, panic, or collapse — just as in motion sickness or vestibulitis.
- Excitability stacks push toward hyper-arousal and explosive behaviour.
- Inhibition stacks push toward depressive, demotivated states (similar to solitary confinement effects).

This framing may offer new ways to mitigate harm and build ethical constraints before deployment.

*🪼 Frankenstack Social Field Effects* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It complements *The Frankenstack Problem* and *Frankenstack Radicalisation Hypothesis* by tracing how hybridised stacks destabilise not just individuals but their surrounding networks through excitability and inhibition levers.
