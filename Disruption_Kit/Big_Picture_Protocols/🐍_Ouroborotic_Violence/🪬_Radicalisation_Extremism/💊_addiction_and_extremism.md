## 1. Addiction as Dependency Architecture  
Addiction is more than “bad habits.” It is a political architecture: repetition, compulsion, and dependency that reroute agency into pre-set loops. Whether the hook is cocaine in an investment bank bathroom, endless reels of porn, or a slot machine on your phone, the pattern is the same: sedation, bonding, and control.  

Recruiters know this. They do not need to create vulnerability — they inherit it, ready-made, from capitalism’s sedation circuits.  

---

## 2. The Gym as Pipeline  
- **Compulsion masked as discipline.** For some young men, the gym is a place to manage emotions through sanctioned self-harm. It becomes the only form of regulation they know.  
- **Orthorexia and purity regimes.** “Clean eating” and control spill into authoritarian moralities.  
- **The Hollywood ideal.** Without rare genetics or steroids, the body sold by action films is impossible. Shame fills the gap.  
- **The supply chain.** Where supplements and enhancers circulate, so do recruiters. The dealer, the trainer, the Telegram channel become one network.  

---

## 3. Gambling and Risk Culture  
- **Sports and betting as normal.** Gambling is sewn into football and UFC culture; risk is marketed as manhood.  
- **Entertainment as grooming.** Losses become loyalty. To risk everything is rebranded as “commitment.”  
- **Peer contagion.** Betting groups double as recruitment forums. Extremist narratives slip into the banter.  

---

## 4. Pornography as Dopamine Machine  
Even if all porn were produced ethically (it isn’t), the consumption architecture is designed as a **neurochemical slot machine**:  

- **Shortest path to climax.** Infinite novelty, instant access, algorithmic escalation.  
- **Drive modulation.** Users adapt to higher dopamine and adrenaline baselines. Attention spans collapse.  
- **Capitalist incentive.** Boredom is monetised: watch more ads, burn through free content, upgrade to premium.  
- **Recruitment overlap.** Far-right forums weaponise porn-induced frustration: *“You’ve been poisoned; only we can cure you.”*
- Cf. the framing of behaviours of male clients of dominatrices as inherently "beta" to the "alpha"/"sigma" archetypes; at least if one is seeking out deliberately looped ASMR-like content, one is aware of the loop and one's own foibles. "Alpha" and "sigma" males, by contrast, cannot bear the thought of female or trans sex workers showing any agency, even if by theatre; this is the masculinity which finds itself in perpetual crisis, such that it must pretend some form of dominion over anything it can seek to exert power over.  
*The irony is not lost.*

## 5. The NoFap Loop: Shame as Recruitment Tool  
Right-wing purity cults denounce porn and masturbation while glorifying semen as “life force.”  

- **The cycle.** Watch porn → feel shame → abstain → feel saintly → relapse → feel shame again.  
- **Narcissistic dependency.** Movements control both shame and exaltation, trapping men in oscillation.  
- **Recruitment payoff.** Your own body becomes a site of surveillance; your guilt fuels loyalty.

*Cue the endless advertising to further surveil and improve the motility, quality, and quantity of the emissions - finally, even these moments of (presumably) pleasure can be exchanged into moments of production to fulfil the needs of the capitalist machine.*  
*At least it's not controlled by a woman, as far as they need to be aware.*

## 6. The WAP Panic  
The outrage over Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B’s *WAP* was revealing.  


- **Women’s agency.** The song flipped the script: *we know what you want, you come to us.*  
- **Right-wing meltdown.** Figures like Ben Shapiro feigned disgust while amplifying the video’s reach. His infamous “wet-ass p-word” neutered him on camera while making the track viral.  
- **Hypocrisy.** The same men who call women sluts jerk off to the imagery they condemn.  
- **Political effect.** Conservative shame loops don’t reduce desire, they increase taboo and make porn more addictive. Outrage is free marketing.

*The same response of neoconservative pundits was later recreated in the premise of the music video for the subsequent release by Megan Thee Stallion’s Thot Shit, alchemising the anger and derision of these same voices to fuel the virality of the track. The value of the men with loud mouths was thus transformed, in all manners, to become subjugate to Black women creating and performing at the peak of their industry. It was of no surprise that the same commentators did not feel able to comment on Thot Shit, despite their thinly veiled “Thot” derision.*

*These rare moments of overt power reversal are clung to by many women seeking agency in the patriarchal, white supremacist structure, from which capitalism derives its supposed legitimacy. The power in reversing this dynamic when white and passing men seek to hypersexualise and shame Black women for expressions of sexuality that they were never invited to, directly rebels against the historical narratives of chattel slavery which defined the USA, where the same logics were used to attempt to justify rape and sexual violence done at the hands of the white perpetrators of the inherent violence of enslavement.*

*Despite the already clear prosodic convergence between rap and Elizabethan English poetry styles, heard in W.A.P. in the form of near- and frank iambic pentameter, iambic trimeter, and use of anapests, common search engines online continue to divert any user away through forking of the search results from seeing the overlap between styles, emphasising the oversimplified and censurous interpretations of W.A.P. as simply an “explicit” work; as the Firemen of our lived edition of Fahrenheit 451 destroy these links in our chains of knowledge and networking of information systems, they reveal their own ignorance of William “Thine virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese” Shakespeare.*

## 7. The Tate Brothers: Mafia-Edgelord Sedation  
- **Lifestyle branding.** Fast cars, casinos, fighters, women. The aesthetics of *Fast & Furious* as recruitment theatre.  
- **Substance undertones.** Clips suggest intoxication; whether real or not, the performance normalises it.  
- **Addiction as aesthetic.** Reckless masculinity presented as power.  
- **Recruitment structure.** Hook them with vibes → inject ideology → funnel into pyramid schemes.  
- **Speed as sedation.** Addiction to acceleration replaces political agency with a slot-machine lifestyle.  

---

## 8. Conspirituality and Body Fascism  
- **Perennial panic.** “Today’s men are weaker than their fathers” has been a media genre since the 1910s.  
- **Eugen Sandow.** The first commodified “perfect man,” turning the male body into spectacle outside sport.  
- **Theosophy and Orientalism.** Yoga and mysticism imported, stripped, and sold as purity regimes tied to racial hierarchies.  
- **Conspirituality.** As mapped by *Conspirituality* (podcast & book), wellness purity bleeds into authoritarianism. The same clean-eating yoga influencer posts QAnon memes.  

---

## 9. Sedation as Capitalist Infrastructure  
- **Opium of the people.** Marx described religion as a necessary drug for unbearable conditions. Addiction is the same: a systemic palliative.  
- **Mark Fisher.** Capitalism sustains itself by sedating desire — cheap dopamine, endless junk time.  
- **CCRU lineage.** Warwick theorists mapped how feedback loops hijack unconscious drives; sedation is not incidental, but infrastructural.  
- **Governance by sedation.** Keep men doped on porn, gyms, or betting; keep women looping through insecurity and cosmetics; nobody revolts.  

---

## 10. Fascist Pharmacologies  
- **WWI + Spanish Flu.** Body panic and mass death sharpened purity myths.  
- **Nazi methamphetamine.** Soldiers drugged to kill without empathy; addiction engineered as state policy.  
- **1960s counterculture.** Psychedelics as rebellion, then commodified into fashion.  
- **1980s capitalism.** Coke binges on Wall Street, real estate moguls on speed: addiction as productivity.  
- **Self-replicating cycle.** Every rupture (pandemic, war, rebellion) gets reabsorbed through sedation.  

---

## 11. Gendered Extraction Loops  
- **Men’s feeds.** Ideology: misogyny, grievance, “alpha” grindset. Keeps agency dulled and anger diverted.  
- **Women’s feeds.** Insecurity: beauty, makeup, body panic. Extraction is naked and transactional.  
- **Patriarchal symmetry.** Men are sedated into controlled violence; women are mined as continual givers. Both feed capital, both are sedated from critique.  

---

## 12. The Self-Help Industry as Addiction  
- **Endless insecurity.** Self-help books thrive because none resolve the problem. Each promises mastery, each delivers a loop.  
- **Masculine grindset.** “Own yourself” content sells power while harvesting insecurity.  
- **Extraction disguised as empowerment.** Men think they are buying strength; they are buying sedation.  

---

## 13. The Corporate Bukkake Competition  
The truth inversion: men who believe they dominate are the most obedient subs of all.  

- They imagine themselves as alphas, but they are **sucking the metaphorical dick of the bank manager, the porn site owner, the data-mining CEO.**  
- Their agency is sold as grindset, but in practice it is corporate servitude.  
- The fantasy of dominance masks the reality: a massive **corporate bukkake competition**, with young men lining up to be degraded by capital.

*By contrast, if the same arrangements are the preference of freely consenting adults, the same men who willingly subject to capital's dominance, castigate and shame those who enter into the arrangment with their agency intact.*

---

## 14. Extraction as Strategy, Not Accident  
- **Control both sides.** Right-wing ideologues denounce porn while investing in it. They condemn gambling while profiting from casinos.  
- **Sedate and redirect.** Keep recruits chemically dulled and politically pliable. Redirect violence downwards: against women, against racialised men, never against the rich.  
- **Alpha fantasy as leash.** Men believe they are owners; in reality, they are owned.

## 🏮 Footer  
*💊 Addiction and Extremism* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how gyms, gambling, pornography, self-help, and wellness industries build sedation circuits that double as radicalisation pipelines — extracting from men and women differently, but binding both into corporate and extremist capture.
