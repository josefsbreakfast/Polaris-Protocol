*How moral vacuum becomes conspiracy fuel.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Defines “folk accountability” — the bottom-up stories and vigilante mythologies people create when formal institutions fail to enforce responsibility.  
Explores how survivor anger, class distrust, and elite impunity converge into populist and conspiratorial movements.

## 📑 Key Sections  

1. **Definition and Dynamics**  
   Folk accountability arises when the public’s ethical expectations exceed the system’s enforcement capacity.  
   - Citizens witness injustice but see no consequences.  
   - Emotional logic replaces legal process: *someone* must pay, even if the wrong target.  
   - Myths become substitute courts.

2. **Emotional Infrastructure**  
   - **Betrayed vigilance:** People trained to report wrongdoing (“See it, Say it”) find their diligence unrewarded.  
   - **Moral displacement:** Anger without outlet attaches to visible scapegoats.  
   - **Digital contagion:** Online echo-systems translate grievance into narrative cohesion faster than institutions can respond.

3. **From Grievance to Myth**  
   Conspiracy movements (QAnon, Pizzagate, satanic-panic revivals) recode real traumas — child abuse, corruption, cover-ups — into symbolic theatre.  
   Their factual content is false, but their emotional grammar is authentic: they perform the accountability that officialdom withholds.

4. **Why Institutions Create the Problem**  
   - Secrecy and non-answers turn suspicion into conviction.  
   - Deferred justice is read as denial.  
   - When elites escape questioning, ordinary offenders are seen as persecuted stand-ins — proof of two-tier law.

5. **Counter-Strategies**  
   - **Visible accountability:** timely, public inquiry into elite wrongdoing.  
   - **Trauma-informed communication:** acknowledge pain before correcting falsehoods.  
   - **Narrative transparency:** show process, not only outcome, to restore cognitive closure.  
   - **Ethical literacy:** teach how confirmation bias and moral injury shape perception.  

6. **Ethical Horizon**  
   Folk accountability is society’s immune response to institutional failure.  
   To end the fever, repair the body — not blame the symptom.  
   Truth-telling, not suppression, is the antidote to myth.
