# 🪬 Racialised Threat Construction  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*How violence is collectivised for minority groups but individualised for dominant ones — and how this asymmetry shapes public policy, media framing, and communal blame.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines a persistent pattern in modern governance and media ecosystems: when violence is committed by members of marginalised groups, it is interpreted as evidence of collective risk; when violence is committed by members of dominant groups, it is framed as individual aberration.

This asymmetry does not arise from the acts themselves, but from **racialised threat construction** — the process by which identity, power, and historical narratives shape how violence is named, explained, and governed.

## ✨ Key Features

* Collective attribution of violence to minority identities
* Individualisation and pathologisation of white perpetrators
* Media framing that expands or contracts communal responsibility
* Policy responses scaled to identity rather than act
* Long-term production of suspect classes

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. Collective vs Individual Framing

When violence is committed by a person racialised as non‑white or Muslim, common framings include:

* religious or cultural explanation
* community responsibility or failure
* ideological contagion
* preventative scrutiny of the wider group

By contrast, when violence is committed by a white perpetrator, framings typically emphasise:

* mental health crisis
* personal grievance
* isolation or loneliness
* lone‑actor narratives

The same level of violence produces **fundamentally different interpretive scales**.

---

### 2. Expansion of Blame

Collectivised framing creates a moral demand on entire communities to:

* condemn violence publicly
* demonstrate loyalty
* perform moderation
* accept surveillance as reassurance

This produces a climate in which innocence must be continually *proven*, rather than assumed.

---

### 3. Policy Translation

Narrative framing becomes policy logic.

Collectivised threat narratives justify:

* population‑level counter‑extremism strategies
* behavioural influence programmes
* school and community referrals
* targeted data collection
* long‑term securitisation of civic life

Individualised narratives, by contrast, rarely generate group‑level interventions.

---

### 4. Historical and Structural Context

Racialised threat construction is reinforced by:

* colonial governance legacies
* racial hierarchies embedded in law
* media economies driven by fear
* political incentives to externalise blame

It is not primarily a matter of personal prejudice, but of **institutional inheritance**.

---

### 5. Downstream Harm

This asymmetry produces cumulative harm:

* stigmatisation of entire populations
* erosion of trust in public institutions
* civic withdrawal and silence
* reinforcement of the securitisation feedback loop

The result is not increased safety, but deeper social fracture.

*🪬 Racialised Threat Construction* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how racialised framing of violence produces unequal governance responses, shaping law, policy, and communal life far beyond the acts themselves.
