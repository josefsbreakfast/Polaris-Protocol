# 🕳️ Denial of Genocide & Denial of Vicarious Trauma  
**First created:** 2025-12-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-16  
*How large-scale atrocity denial and the dismissal of secondary trauma function as the same containment move at different scales.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines two forms of denial that are often treated separately but operate through the same logic:

- **Denial of genocide** — refusal to recognise mass atrocity as real, intentional, or ongoing.  
- **Denial of vicarious trauma** — refusal to recognise harm experienced by those who witness, document, analyse, or support victims.

Both are **epistemic violence**.  
Both are used to shut down responsibility.  
Both preserve institutional comfort by isolating harm to “direct victims only,” even when the system itself forces exposure.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Denial scales cleanly: from bodies → witnesses → archivists → analysts → publics  
- “Too emotional” is used as a delegitimisation tool, not a clinical description  
- Institutions rely on secondary exposure while denying its consequences  
- Trauma denial is framed as professionalism, neutrality, or rationality

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Denial as a System, Not an Opinion  
Genocide denial is rarely a simple claim that “nothing happened.”  
More often it appears as:

- minimisation (“not that many”)  
- temporal displacement (“that was in the past”)  
- intent laundering (“complex conflict”, “both sides”)  
- procedural deferral (“investigations are ongoing”)  

Denial of **vicarious trauma** uses the same grammar:

- minimisation (“you weren’t there”)  
- displacement (“take a break if it’s hard”)  
- intent laundering (“you chose this work”)  
- procedural deferral (“use the proper wellbeing channels”)  

In both cases, the goal is not truth.  
It is **containment**.

---

### 2. Why Vicarious Trauma Is Threatening  
Acknowledging vicarious trauma would require institutions to admit that:

- Harm propagates through information systems  
- Exposure is often compulsory, not voluntary  
- Documentation itself carries risk  
- Ethical witnessing has a cost  

This collapses the fiction that violence is localised only in bodies.  
It reveals violence as **networked**.

That is dangerous to power.

---

### 3. Professionalism as a Silencing Technology  
Both denials lean heavily on a false binary:

> *Rational = credible*  
> *Affected = biased*

This is operationally useful.  
It allows institutions to:

- demand testimony while rejecting its impact  
- extract labour without acknowledging injury  
- disqualify witnesses precisely when they are most informed  

In genocide contexts, this often targets journalists, clinicians, aid workers, researchers, and diasporic communities.  
In vicarious trauma contexts, it targets the same people — just earlier in the chain.

---

### 4. Recursive Harm  
When vicarious trauma is denied:

- Witnesses self-censor  
- Documentation degrades  
- Archives thin  
- Public understanding collapses  

This makes **future denial easier**.

Denial does not merely respond to trauma.  
It **produces more of it**.

---

### 5. Why This Matters Now  
Digital systems intensify exposure while disowning responsibility:

- endless image circulation  
- algorithmic amplification  
- forced proximity without consent  
- no exit ramps  

At the same time, institutions insist that only “direct victims” count.

This is not an oversight.  
It is a design choice.

*Denial of Genocide & Denial of Vicarious Trauma* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how harm is systematically narrowed to preserve power, and how witnessing itself becomes a site of injury.
