# 🪆 Misdiagnosis of Radicalisation Models  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*How governments misread extremist pathways as ideology‑first rather than condition‑first, producing ineffective and discriminatory policy.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines a foundational error in modern counter‑extremism policy: the assumption that radicalisation begins with **belief** rather than with **conditions**.

By treating ideology as the primary driver of violence, governments built systems that target ideas, identity, and expression — while neglecting the social, economic, and psychological conditions that make a small minority vulnerable to extremist recruitment.

## ✨ Key Features

* Ideology treated as cause rather than container
* Behaviour interpreted without situational context
* Belief‑policing substituted for social repair
* Over‑prediction and false positives
* Discriminatory outcomes despite neutral framing

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. The Ideology‑First Assumption

Early counter‑terrorism frameworks assumed a linear pathway:

> belief → radicalisation → violence

This model implies that monitoring, countering, or suppressing ideas will prevent harm.

Empirical research has repeatedly shown this assumption to be false.

---

### 2. The Condition‑First Reality

Comparative studies across extremist movements show a different pattern:

> injury → grievance → belonging → commitment → belief

In this model:

* ideology follows engagement,
* belief rationalises action already taken,
* narratives supply meaning to pre‑existing wounds.

---

### 3. Why the Misdiagnosis Persisted

Ideology‑first models persisted because they:

* align with security institutions’ remit
* offer visible, actionable targets
* avoid confronting structural inequality
* translate easily into messaging and surveillance

Condition‑first models, by contrast, demand long‑term social investment and political courage.

---

### 4. Policy Consequences

Ideology‑first misdiagnosis led to:

* belief and expression monitoring
* disproportionate targeting of minorities
* proxy indicators replacing evidence
* expansion of suspect class governance
* neglect of proven protective factors

The result was policy that **felt decisive** but performed poorly.

---

### 5. Empirical Mismatch

Key findings consistently ignored by ideology‑first policy:

* most people with extremist beliefs never engage in violence
* most violent actors lack deep ideological literacy
* pathways vary widely by context and opportunity
* social connection predicts disengagement better than belief change

Ignoring this evidence locked systems into failure.
