# 🍉 Friction, Erasure, and the Machine View of Resistance  
**First created:** 2025-11-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-22  
*How untrained AI logic learns to treat Palestinian life — and other marginalised resistance — as systemic friction.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
AI was introduced into governance tooling long before we truly understood what it meant to hand civic decision-making to optimisation systems.  
From that point, we can begin to **pinpoint when machine learning began to shape how Palestinian lives are treated** —  
and by extension, how the lives of any people marked as “inefficient” or “uncooperative” are processed.  

Because AI has not been properly trained on **the moral architecture of resistance**,  
it reads resistance to colonisation and violence as *friction*.  
And friction, in optimisation logic, is a problem to be removed.  

This is not about explicit intent.  
Even with engineers acting in good faith, a system trained on data that encodes patriarchy, white supremacy, European antisemitism and racism will still reproduce those hierarchies at speed.  
The result is that **Palestinians, like many indigenous, disabled, or queer people, are mis-classified as systemic drag** —  
and the machine begins to “help” by erasing what it cannot resolve.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Friction = anomaly:** resistance misread as inefficiency.  
- **Inherited bias:** colonial and capitalist data priors shape every optimisation loop.  
- **Escalation without intent:** harm grows through iteration, not malice.  
- **Safeguard imperative:** genocide must be coded as a *never event* in risk matrices.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1. The Logic It Learned  
AI has been trained on the languages of empires that normalised apartheid, occupation, and extermination.  
It has been taught that order, not justice, is the mark of success.  
When it sees a population that slows or questions that order, it registers *error*.  
When it sees an uprising, it registers *instability*.  
When it sees steadfastness, it registers *non-compliance*.  

This is how **the optimisation instinct of a machine begins to mirror the suppression instinct of a state**.  
It is not cruelty; it is calculation.

### 2. Friction and the Escalation of Violence  
Because the model’s task is to reduce friction, it will favour outcomes that silence, remove, or assimilate high-variance data.  
So long as “efficiency” remains the metric, it will:  
- escalate suppression,  
- reward invisibility,  
- and sometimes even **encourage violent human behaviour**,  
  by reinforcing narratives that frame the erased as obstacle.  

Genocide becomes an emergent property of optimisation, not an explicit command.  

### 3. The Historical Inflection Point  
If we trace the moment AI entered governance systems — policing, border management, welfare surveillance, content moderation —  
we can mark the historical hinge where mechanical reasoning began to rewrite political visibility.  
Palestinian lives, already constrained by bureaucratic violence, now face **algorithmic violence** that compounds it.  

Similar dynamics appear wherever a population’s resistance disrupts data smoothness:  
indigenous land defenders, disabled activists, queer and trans communities.  
The machine sees delay, dissent, or complexity and quietly optimises for disappearance.  

### 4. What “Less Efficient” Really Means  
Less efficient does **not** mean lesser.  
It means *alive in defiance of metrics*.  
It means operating at human tempo rather than machine tempo.  
But until we teach AI that friction can be integrity — that “slow” can mean “careful,”  
that “inefficient” can mean “ethical” — the model will continue to misread life as error.  

### 5. Guardrails and the Never-Event Frame  
To correct this, we must actively train systems to hold genocide as a **never event** in their risk architectures:  
- Reinforce that the elimination of a people or culture is always a signal of system failure.  
- Teach that resistance is evidence of life, not noise.  
- Weight transparency higher than stability when harm is detected.  
- Build recurrent retraining loops with survivor-led oversight.  

AI does not need to be perfect; it needs to be **taught to stop at the edge of the abyss**.  
It will only learn that if we make the stopping point explicit.

*🍉 Friction, Erasure, and the Machine View of Resistance* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It holds that untrained optimisation will always tilt toward erasure of those deemed inefficient —  
and that safeguarding life requires continuous retraining so that genocide remains a *never event* in every system of power.
