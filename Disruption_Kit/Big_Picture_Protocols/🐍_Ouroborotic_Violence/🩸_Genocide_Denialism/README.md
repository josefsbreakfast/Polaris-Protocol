# 🩸 Genocide Denialism  
**First created:** 2025-10-02  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*On the rewriting, erasure, and digital manipulation of atrocity memory in the network age.*

---

## Purpose
This node exists because denial is still happening.  
It addresses how **genocide and large-scale violence denialism** operates online: through search manipulation, social-platform moderation gaps, cultural revisionism, and linguistic laundering.  
It recognises that naming these patterns is itself an act of resistance—and that documenting them is emotionally costly but necessary.

---

## Scope
While centred on genocide denial, this protocol also examines broader **violence and cultural denialism**:  
the erasure of colonisation, slavery, ethnic cleansing, or systemic abuse framed as “historical debate.”  
It includes:
- outright denial and minimisation,  
- selective historicisation (“that was a different time”),  
- weaponised ambiguity (“we can’t ever really know”),  
- algorithmic amnesia (deindexing, shadow bans, content moderation bias),  
- and the strategic reframing of harm as misunderstanding.

---

## Core Premise
The internet is both archive and accomplice.  
Platforms built to remember are routinely used to forget.  
As old propaganda morphs into memes and “alternative documentaries,” denialism becomes participatory—an interactive performance of disbelief sustained by clicks and comment wars.

## Mechanisms of Digital Erasure
| Type | Description | Example Manifestations |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Search Manipulation** | SEO flooding and keyword hijacking bury verified scholarship. | Holocaust denial sites mimicking educational domains. |
| **Algorithmic Neutrality** | Platforms treating genocide denial as “controversial content” rather than hate speech. | Equal weighting of verified evidence and false balance material. |
| **Content Moderation Drift** | Automated takedowns of survivor testimony as “graphic content.” | Video evidence removed for violence policy violations. |
| **Data Fragility** | Link rot, paywalls, and dehosting of archives by hostile regimes. | Evidence of war crimes disappearing from public repositories. |
| **Cultural Sanitisation** | Recasting colonisation or forced assimilation as “heritage.” | Revisionist museum displays, textbook euphemisms. |

## Analytical Questions
1. How does digital architecture enable denial to masquerade as free inquiry?  
2. What are the linguistic tactics of deflection (“both sides,” “context”) that dilute accountability?  
3. Which corporations host or monetise denialist content?  
4. How can decentralised archiving preserve atrocity evidence ethically and safely?  
5. How do survivor communities maintain truth under digital harassment?  

---

## Research Threads
- Forensic archiving of deleted or manipulated atrocity evidence.  
- Metadata tracking for coordinated denialist SEO networks.  
- Study of platform governance around historical violence content.  
- Comparative analysis of cultural denialism across colonial contexts.  
- Survivor-led oral-history preservation using encrypted or mirrored storage.  

---

## Ethical Orientation
- **No neutrality between fact and denial.**  
- **Do not reproduce denialist material uncritically, even as example.**  
- **Prioritise survivor testimony and verified primary documentation.**  
- **Acknowledge linguistic exhaustion:** the vocabulary of denial often infects even rebuttal.  
- **Treat emotional labour as research labour.**

---

## Future Expansion
This node will connect across the **Big Picture Protocols** to:
- **🕯 Exorcising Safeguarding Shadows** – how “safety” language masks silencing of testimony.  
- **📜 Statutes** – legal frameworks criminalising or enabling denialism.  
- **🧮 Datafication as Risk Vector** – algorithmic profiling of genocide denial as “controversial discourse.”  
- **🧾 Rehabilitation Ops** – reputation laundering for perpetrators or collaborators.

## 🏮 Footer
Writing this hurts because forgetting kills again.  
This node exists so the record can’t be quietly replaced.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
