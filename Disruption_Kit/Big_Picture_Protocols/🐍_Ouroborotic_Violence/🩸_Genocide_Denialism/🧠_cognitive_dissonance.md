# 🧠 Cognitive Dissonance  
**First created:** 2025-10-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*On the psychic split that sustains denial in the face of atrocity.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explores **cognitive dissonance** as both a psychological defence and a governance tool.  
In genocide denialism, it becomes a mechanism that allows individuals, institutions, or states to maintain moral coherence while participating in, enabling, or ignoring harm.  
It bridges the psychological and political registers — from individual discomfort to collective rationalisation.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Psychological definition and function of dissonance.  
- Mechanisms by which dissonance is resolved through denial.  
- How governments, media, and publics co-produce comfortable fictions.  
- Survivor implications when dissonance becomes institutional policy.

## 🪼 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Psychological Function  
Cognitive dissonance arises when beliefs and behaviours clash. The discomfort it produces pushes people to justify or rationalise contradiction — often by denying or reframing evidence.  
In atrocity contexts, this self-justification process protects identity and belonging more than truth.

### 2. From Individual to Collective  
When collective identity is threatened, dissonance scales up.  
Societies build **mythic buffers**: narratives of “security,” “defence,” or “civilisation” that make mass harm feel necessary or virtuous.  
The lie is not always believed — it is *performed* to maintain stability.

### 3. Bureaucratised Dissonance  
Governments convert moral conflict into paperwork.  
Reports are redacted, statistics reframed, and language neutralised.  
Bureaucracy absorbs discomfort, allowing denial to masquerade as due process.

### 4. Survivor Impact  
For survivors, witnessing this denial compounds trauma.  
It tells them their pain is an *error in perception*, not evidence.  
Cognitive dissonance, when scaled to the state, becomes **epistemic gaslighting** — the denial of reality itself.

### 5. Counter-Mechanisms  
Breaking dissonance requires **witnessing**, **narrative confrontation**, and **collective re-integration of moral coherence**.  
In the archive, fidelity to survivor voice directly resists the dissonant pull to sanitise or forget.
