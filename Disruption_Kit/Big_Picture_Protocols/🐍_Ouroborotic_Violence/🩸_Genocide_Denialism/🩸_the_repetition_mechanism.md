*Selective enforcement as a rehearsal of genocidal permissibility.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node connects selective terrorism designations to historic permissibility logics that preceded genocides.  
By excusing or minimising violence against certain minorities, the state rehearses the same moral indifference that once enabled extermination.

## ✨ Analysis  

1. **Historical echo**  
   - Pre-Holocaust Europe normalised incremental exclusion: each unpunished attack signalled who was outside protection.  
   - Today, under-classification of anti-Muslim or anti-Sikh violence performs that signal again.  

2. **Sequential targeting**  
   - Antisemitism and Islamophobia are not rival hatreds; they are sequential.  
   - Allowing one group’s terror to go unnamed ensures the next group will inherit it.  

3. **Permissibility as contagion**  
   - Bureaucratic euphemism (“hate crime,” “isolated incident”) inoculates perpetrators from moral consequence.  
   - Each euphemism lowers the collective threshold for future atrocity.  

4. **Preventive imperative**  
   - Equality in naming violence is a genocide-prevention measure.  
   - To misname is to prepare the ground for repetition.
