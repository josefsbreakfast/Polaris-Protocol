# 🪨 May Their Names Never Be Erased  
**First created:** 2025-10-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*A living memorial dataset: holding reference lists of those murdered in Gaza, affirming their lives when even the number of dead is contested.*

## 🫀 Orientation  
This node safeguards memory against deliberate erasure.  
When the count of the dead is obscured, argued, or delayed, the act of **naming** becomes both forensic and sacred.  
Each record affirms a person’s existence — a refusal to let statistical debate replace human life.  

Whole families were lost. Erased in the flesh.  
So we remember their names in the data at least.  

Primary dataset:  
> [Killed in Gaza — Tech for Palestine (up to July 2025)](https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/killed-in-gaza/)  
> *(Operation Iron Swords and subsequent assaults, Gaza only)*  
> _Note: Gaza treated as a separate municipality under the current illegal occupation of Palestine._
