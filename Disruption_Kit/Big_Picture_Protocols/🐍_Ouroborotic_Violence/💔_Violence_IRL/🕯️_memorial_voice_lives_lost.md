## 🩸 Analysis  
Each entry exposes a different failure chain:  
- **Platform design** that prizes intimacy without safeguards.  
- **Cultural narratives** that sexualise women’s voices and punish autonomy.  
- **Institutional inertia** that classifies these deaths as “isolated incidents.”  

Together, they form a **continuum of erasure** — the silencing of voices that were first amplified, then consumed.

It preserves the names of those whose visibility became vulnerability, refusing their reduction to case studies or cautionary tales.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
