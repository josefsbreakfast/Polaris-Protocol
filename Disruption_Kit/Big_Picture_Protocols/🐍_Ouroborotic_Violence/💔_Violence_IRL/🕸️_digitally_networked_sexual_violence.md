# 🕸️ Digitally Networked Sexual Violence  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-23  
*Definition and diagnostic mapping of the emerging harm-pattern in which groups of men use digital platforms to coordinate, validate, or enact sexual violence.*

---

## 1. Overview  
Digitally Networked Sexual Violence (**DNSV**) describes a pattern of **coordinated, peer-validated sexual violence** facilitated through digital platforms.  
It involves multiple perpetrators acting through group dynamics rather than isolated offences.  
DNSV presently has **no recognised legal category**, making it a structural blind-spot across policing, safeguarding, and transnational enforcement.

DNSV includes:  
- coordinated sharing of non-consensual intimate images  
- sexualised harassment in group settings  
- encouragement or planning of sexual assault  
- trophy-based “economies” of voyeurism or humiliation  
- migration across platforms to evade moderation  
- distributed predation enabled by anonymity and peer validation

DNSV is therefore a **network harm**, not a content-moderation issue.

---

## 2. Core Definition  
**DNSV = sexual violence + peer reinforcement + networked coordination.**

It is characterised by:  
- **collective sexual predation**, conducted digitally  
- **group-based escalation**, where men incentivise one another  
- **organised misogyny**, presenting as casual social bonding  
- **trophic roles** within groups (admins, watchers, participants)  
- **platform drift**, re-forming networks after takedown  
- **forensic opacity**, with victims rarely informed their images circulate  

DNSV mirrors organised violence structures despite often appearing informal or “everyday.”

---

## 3. System Blind-Spots  
DNSV evades current institutional frameworks for the following reasons:

### 3.1 Policing  
- Offences are treated as individual acts.  
- “Conspiracy to rape” is only recognised in extreme cases.  
- No category exists for **adult-victim sexual violence networks**.

### 3.2 Safeguarding  
- Online sexual violence is coded as an “indicator,” not a **network ecosystem**.  
- No protocols capture patterns across social groups or platforms.

### 3.3 Transnational Enforcement  
- Europol units prioritise **CSAM**, trafficking, and financial crime.  
- Adult-victim networked sexual violence does not trigger established escalation pathways.

### 3.4 Platform Governance  
- Platforms treat DNSV as **TOS violations**, not **organised sexual violence**.  
- Takedowns remove evidence; victims are not notified; no forensic trail is secured.

---

## 4. Behavioural Signatures  
DNSV displays a recognisable morphology across platforms:

- **Distributed agency** — shared culpability, diffused responsibility.  
- **Social incentive loops** — status gained through escalation.  
- **Predatory cohesion** — groups form around sexual violation as bonding.  
- **Cross-platform migration** — Telegram → Discord → WhatsApp → closed forums.  
- **Trophy circulation** — non-consensual images used as proof or currency.  
- **Violence rehearsal spaces** — “fantasy” used to practice or normalise assault.  
- **Reformation cycles** — group reappearance in more encrypted forms.

These signatures make DNSV identifiable as a **networked predation structure**.

---

## 5. Platform Dynamics  
Platforms typically respond with:  
- group deletions  
- content removals  
- individual suspensions  

They rarely:  
- refer cases to law enforcement  
- preserve evidential pathways  
- trace admins or recruiters  
- notify victims  
- map cross-platform involvement  

This creates a **high-entropy violence environment**, in which DNSV can flourish.

---

## 6. Case Indicators (Selected)  
*To be expanded with a formal case table.*

- **Pelicot Case (France)** — husband facilitating group rape via digital networks.  
- **German Telegram Groups** — 70,000+ men sharing “rape guides.”  
- **Italian “Mia Moglie” Group** — 32k sharing non-consensual images of women they knew.  
- **Australian Discord Networks** — gamified point-scoring for sexual images.  
- **Singapore “Nasi Lemak” Group** — large-scale non-consensual image distribution.

DNSV appears across jurisdictions but lacks a recognised harm category.

---

## 7. Systems Analysis  
DNSV intersects directly with Polaris diagnostic frameworks:

- **credibility collapse** — victims disbelieved or pathologised  
- **token integrity drift** — polluted image/data shadows  
- **metadata sabotage** — misclassification and digital trail distortion  
- **psychological containment loops** — reframing of victim narratives  
- **public-sector risk models** misreading network harm as individual pathology  

DNSV is a **frankenstack vulnerability**: emerging, under-detected, and structurally favoured by current digital architectures.

---

## 8. Preliminary Recommendations  

### 8.1 Recognition  
Establish **DNSV** as a formal harm category across:  
- safeguarding  
- policing  
- platform regulation  
- academic frameworks  
- Europol/Interpol taxonomies

### 8.2 Platform Duties  
- mandatory forensic retention  
- referral pathways to relevant authorities  
- victim notification systems  
- explicit classification of DNSV as **sexual violence**

### 8.3 Legal Pathways  
New offence category:  
**Participation in Digitally Networked Sexual Violence**,  
analogous to coercive control frameworks.

## 🏮 Footer  
**Digitally Networked Sexual Violence** is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, establishing a structural vocabulary for recognising coordinated sexual violence facilitated through digital networks. It formalises an emerging harm-pattern currently invisible to policing, safeguarding, and platform-governance schemas.
