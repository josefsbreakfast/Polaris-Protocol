# 💔 When Violence Becomes IRL  
**First created:** 2025-10-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*On the migration of networked harm from timeline to body.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Every digital system that trades in outrage eventually seeks embodiment.  
Harassment becomes surveillance; surveillance becomes contact; contact becomes assault.  
This node traces that transfer — the point where extremist fantasies, parasocial fixations, and attention economies converge into physical harm.

## 🐅 Mechanics of Transition  

| Vector | Digital Behaviour | Physical Expression |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Parasocial fixation** | obsessive following, tipping, fan-economy dependency | stalking, home intrusion, femicide |
| **Ideological radicalisation** | misogynist forums, doxxing raids, incel subcultures | hate crimes, coordinated attacks |
| **Gamified harassment** | raid servers, swarm tactics | mob-on-individual violence |
| **Platform neglect** | delayed moderation, algorithmic amplification | social permission for repeat offences |

## 🕯️ Memorial Cross-Reference  
See [🕯️ Memorial — Voice Lives Lost](./🕯️_memorial_voice_lives_lost.md)  
— a roll call of creators killed through parasocial and extremist pathways.  
These deaths are not anomalies; they are system outputs.

## 🧠 Institutional Failure Loop  
1. **Denial:** framed as “isolated incidents.”  
2. **Pathologising:** attributed to mental-health rather than misogyny.  
3. **Spectacle:** death as click-through.  
4. **Forgetting:** platform resets; cycle restarts.

## 🌌 Constellations  
🐍 💋 🕯️ 🩸 — recursion, gender, memorial, harm.  
Bridges **Ouroborotic Violence** with **Expression of Norms** (media ethics) and **Watch the Watchers** (platform accountability).

*💔 When Violence Becomes IRL* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the threshold where mediated hostility incarnates, reminding that no algorithm is virtual once a body is lost.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
