# 🐍 Ouroborotic Violence  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-17  
*Hub folder tracing recursive architectures of harm — where violence consumes and reproduces itself.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
*Ouroborotic Violence* gathers nodes that document how cycles of violence reabsorb their own opposition — transforming repression, denial, and counterinsurgency into self-perpetuating systems.  
It examines the architectures that make violence appear inevitable:  
- the bureaucratic myth of “security,”  
- the theological logic of purification, and  
- the policy recursion that recasts suppression as protection.  

This cluster is diagnostic rather than narrative: each subfolder maps one recursion route — genocide denial, radicalisation containment, and memory weaponisation — and their interdependence.

## 📂 Subfolders  

- **🩸 Genocide Denialism** — mechanisms of repetition, revisionism, and suppression of survivor record.  
- **🪬 Radicalisation & Extremism** — Prevent logic, imported security paradigms, and risk-matrix reproduction.  
- **🗝️ Politics Memory Work** — how state memory, apology, and selective forgetting sustain harm cycles.

## 🌌 Constellations  
🐍 🩸 🪬 🗝️ 🕯️ — recursion, suppression, remembrance, and state myth.

*🐍 Ouroborotic Violence* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It serves as the integrative cluster for systemic violence recursion — linking denialism, radicalisation control, and politicised memory into one diagnostic spine.
