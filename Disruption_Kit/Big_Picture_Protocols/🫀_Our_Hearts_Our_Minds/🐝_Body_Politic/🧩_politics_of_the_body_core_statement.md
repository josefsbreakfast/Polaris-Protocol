# 🧩 Politics of the Body: Core Statement  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Why disability is not niche, and why ableism sustains every system of containment.*  

---

## 📖 Definition  

Every person alive is **temporarily able-bodied**. Unless you die suddenly, you will become disabled. If not you, then someone you love. One in four people at any given time already are.  

Ableism is not a side issue. It is a **root script of exclusion**: society trains us to see disabled bodies as diminished, disposable, or comic. Even the most “emancipated” thinkers still compare their enemies to disability — calling them blind, lame, idiotic — without blinking. That is not metaphor. It is **eugenics.**  

To fight fascism, colonialism, and capitalism without fighting ableism is a contradiction. You cannot dismantle one without dismantling the others.

## 🌀 Patterns  

- **Language:** Ableist words are everywhere. We all use them. That is not proof of hypocrisy, but proof of how deep the script runs.  
- **Surveillance:** Disabled people are the test-bed for welfare monitoring and care logging.  
- **Aesthetic containment:** Institutional beige kit overwrites personhood.  
- **Exploitation:** Industries profit from prolonging disablement.

## 🌱 Counterforce  

- **TAB reminder:** Disability is your future, not someone else’s niche.  
- **Social model:** You are disabled by systems, not diagnosis.  
- **Swarm care:** Bees look after each other; disabled communities model interdependence.  
- **Refusal:** Reject pity, hospital chic, and eugenics-as-metaphor.
