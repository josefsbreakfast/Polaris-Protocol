*Why “no” to hospital logic is systemic, not personal.*  

---

## 📖 Definition  

Refusal is not stubbornness. Refusal is politics.  
When disabled people say no — no to beige gear, no to pity, no to infantilisation — they are rejecting the institutional logics that creep into every domain of life.  

---

## 🌀 Patterns  

- **Product refusal:** refusing hospital-style kit in favour of parity design.  
- **Narrative refusal:** rejecting pity stories or “inspiration porn.”  
- **Policy refusal:** fighting welfare systems built on surveillance and punishment.  

---

## 🌱 Counterforce  

- **Refusal as survival:** survival itself is political.  
- **Refusal as dignity:** saying no is a form of authorship.  
- **Refusal as swarm:** collective refusals sting harder.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
