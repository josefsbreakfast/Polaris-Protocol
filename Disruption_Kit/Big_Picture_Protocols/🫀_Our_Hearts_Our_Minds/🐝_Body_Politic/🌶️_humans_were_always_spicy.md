# 🌶️ Humans Were Always Spicy  
**First created:** 2026-01-04 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-04  
*Why human emotion, volatility, humour, fear, desire, and contradiction are not bugs — and why systems that deny this collapse.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node exists to counter a persistent modern error: the idea that humans are, or ever were, fundamentally rational agents who occasionally malfunction.

They weren’t.  
They aren’t.  
They never will be.

Humans are mammals with expensive brains, volatile nervous systems, symbolic languages, and bodies that predate philosophy by millions of years. Any attempt to model human behaviour — politically, technologically, or ethically — that ignores this will eventually fail.

Often violently.

## ✨ Key Features  

- Human “irrationality” is an energy-saving feature, not a defect  
- Classical philosophies assumed volatility; modern rationalism often denies it  
- Authoritarian systems collapse by mistaking control for containment  
- Emotion, humour, and ritual function as pressure valves  
- AI and technocratic governance fail when they model humans as algebra

## 🧠 The Brain Is Not a Spreadsheet  

Human cognition is layered, not unified.

- **Fast paths**: fear, sex, humour, threat, attachment  
- **Slow paths**: deliberation, abstraction, ethical reasoning  

The fast paths:
- use less glucose  
- require less inhibition  
- activate earlier in development  
- override higher reasoning under stress  

This is not immaturity.  
It is **energy economics**.

When oxygen drops, glucose drops, or fear spikes, the brainstem and limbic system take control. Logic does not disappear — it simply loses the vote.

Any system that expects humans to remain “rational” under stress is describing a species that does not exist.

## 🏛️ Classical Philosophy Knew This  

Ancient logic systems were never naïve about human volatility.

Stoicism emerged in a world of:
- routine violence  
- political assassinations  
- slavery  
- exile  
- public executions  
- revolution  

When Stoics spoke of tempering the spirit, they were not discussing productivity optimisation. They were talking about **preventing humans from killing each other**.

Likewise, mystery cults and religious rituals often functioned as:
- symbolic violence  
- controlled transgression  
- emotional discharge  
- collective containment  

Ancient societies did not deny human spice.  
They **managed** it.

## 🌀 Fascism as Compulsion Loop  

Authoritarian and fascist systems fail not because they are insufficiently logical, but because they are **obsessively so**.

They exhibit:
- purity fixation  
- enemy fixation  
- hierarchy fixation  
- control fixation  

These are not rational patterns.  
They are **recursive compulsions**:

> anxiety → control → failure → increased anxiety → harsher control

Because they deny humour, contradiction, ritual discharge, and emotional expression, pressure builds until it escapes as cruelty, paranoia, or collapse.

Fascism is what happens when a system refuses to admit humans are spicy.

## 🧬 Modern Rationalism’s Category Error  

A common modern mistake is treating logic not as a tool, but as an identity.

This produces a fetishised view of intelligence as:
- clean  
- abstract  
- emotionless  
- algebraic  

In reality:
- logic is a scaffold  
- emotion is the substrate  
- embodiment is the constraint  

Even fear responses that look “illogical” at the individual level (e.g. spiders in safe environments) are logical at the species level. Humans trade false positives for survival.

Rationalism that denies this becomes brittle.

## 🤖 AI Is an Adjunct, Not a Replacement  

AI systems excel at:
- pattern recognition  
- optimisation  
- probabilistic inference  

Humans excel at:
- embodiment  
- emotional meaning  
- social navigation  
- symbolic play  
- humour  
- contradiction  

Calling AI “like a human brain” is not flattering — it is inaccurate.

AI is an **adjunct**: a cognitive prosthetic for specific tasks, not a nervous system, not a mammal, and not a substitute for human messiness.

Models that pretend otherwise misread users, mispredict behaviour, and misjudge risk.

---

## 🌶️ Conclusion  

Humans were always spicy.

Any system — political, philosophical, technological — that:
- denies emotion  
- suppresses humour  
- pathologises fear  
- fetishises logic  
- or treats bodies as noise  

will eventually be punished by reality.

Not because humans are broken —  
but because the model is wrong.
