# 👁️‍🗨️ Surveillance of Disabled Bodies  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*How disabled people are the test-bed for normalised surveillance.*  

---

## 📖 Definition  

Surveillance regimes trial themselves first on disabled people. From care logs to benefits reporting, disabled lives are monitored in intimate, demeaning ways. Once normalised here, these methods spread everywhere.  

---

## 🌀 Patterns  

- **Care sheets:** “Are they in bed, are they watching TV?”  
- **Benefits surveillance:** endless reassessments, suspicion as default.  
- **Medical monitoring:** wearables and check-ins framed as “safety.”  
- **Normalization:** once accepted for disabled people, rolled out to workers, students, public.  

---

## 🌱 Counterforce  

- **Expose test-bedding:** name where surveillance starts.  
- **Solidarity:** recognise that what is done to disabled people will be done to all.  
- **Swarm refusal:** collective resistance breaks the template.

*Surveillance of Disabled Bodies* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how surveillance regimes prototype themselves on disabled people before rolling out more widely.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
