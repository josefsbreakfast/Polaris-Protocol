# 🔥 Femme Firewall Fatale — The Panic at Female Intelligence  
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Systems that tolerate radical ideas but not women’s authority.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Analyses the recurrent cultural glitch where institutions celebrate radical critique until it arrives embodied as a woman.  
The idea is acceptable; the originator is not.  
This reflex exposes the last boundary of patriarchal design: intellectual control.

---

## 🧩 1. Idea Without Author  
Institutions adopt progressive theory while sidelining its creators.  
Citation networks whiten, masculinise, and depersonalise.  
Authority detaches from authorship for comfort.

---

## ⚙️ 2. The Panic Response  
Encountering female intellect triggers status anxiety.  
Polite disbelief masks fear: *“Surely she can’t have meant it.”*  
Systems firewall by reframing—“unbalanced,” “too emotional,” “uncooperative.”

---

## 💡 3. Counter-Coding  
- Attribute ideas publicly and persistently.  
- Archive provenance.  
- Pair critique with humour; grace disarms defence.  
- Maintain witness networks to verify authorship history.
