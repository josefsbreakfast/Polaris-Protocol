# 🧠 Where Is This “Over-Diagnosis”?
**First created:** 2025-12-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-16  
*A diagnostic challenge to a political claim that refuses to specify itself.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
UK politicians repeatedly claim there is an “over-diagnosis” of mental health and disability — yet rarely specify **where**, **by whom**, **in relation to what baseline**, or **with what evidentiary threshold**.

This node treats “over-diagnosis” not as a settled fact, but as a **floating accusation**: rhetorically powerful, statistically vague, and politically useful. Its purpose is not to deny that diagnostic error can exist, but to insist on a prior and more disciplined question:

> *Where, exactly, is this over-diagnosis supposed to be happening?*

Until that question is answered, the claim is ideological rather than analytical.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Identifies “over-diagnosis” as an unfalsified rhetorical claim  
- Exposes the demand to prove a negative as a logical red flag  
- Re-centres NHS, austerity, and housing context  
- Connects diagnostic rhetoric to wealth disparity and false scarcity  

---

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. A claim without coordinates  
In medical or statistical contexts, a claim of over-diagnosis would require:
- a reference population  
- a comparison baseline  
- diagnostic criteria under review  
- evidence of systematic misapplication  
- demonstration of net harm  

In political speech, these coordinates are usually absent.

The term is allowed to float — detached from discipline, but heavy with implication.

---

### 2. Over-diagnosed compared to *what*?  
Multiple distinct phenomena are routinely collapsed into one accusation:
- increased recognition of previously underdiagnosed groups  
- expanded criteria reflecting better evidence  
- post-crisis prevalence changes (e.g. post-COVID effects)  
- increased access to assessment  
- reduced stigma leading to help-seeking  

None of these are synonymous with over-diagnosis.

Failure to disaggregate them is not a minor error. It is the mechanism by which the rhetoric functions.

---

### 3. Measurement change is not pathology inflation  
A basic category error underpins much of this discourse:

> *More diagnoses = too many diagnoses*

When measurement improves, counts rise — even if underlying prevalence was always there. Politicians routinely treat historical undercounting as “normality” and present visibility as excess.

That is not neutrality. It is bias toward neglect.

---

### 4. The demand to prove a negative  
A further red flag is logical rather than medical.

Those asserting over-diagnosis rarely offer a positive, testable claim. Instead, others are asked to *disprove* it — to show that people are **not** over-diagnosed.

In science and logic, this is improper. You do not shift the burden of proof while withholding specificity.

Vagueness here is not accidental. It insulates the claim from falsification.

---

### 5. Why over-diagnosis data is scarce  
If over-diagnosis were widespread, clear signals would appear in the system.

Instead:
- NHS diagnostic pathways are referral-gated  
- thresholds are high and specialist-led  
- waiting times are long  
- access is rationed  
- reversal or removal of diagnoses is rare and procedurally complex  

It is not easy to be diagnosed in the NHS.  
It is even harder to be misdiagnosed and then corrected.

The absence of robust over-diagnosis data reflects system design, not concealment.

---

### 6. The NHS context routinely omitted  
This rhetoric also ignores the conditions under which the NHS has operated since austerity.

In real terms:
- NHS funding has failed to keep pace with inflation and population need  
- health spending as a share of GDP has stagnated  
- services are routinely decommissioned on cost–benefit grounds  
- waiting lists and crisis-only access have grown  

A system under these conditions does not produce frivolous diagnosis.  
It produces delay, attrition, and emergency escalation.

---

### 7. The missing half of the system: social care  
The NHS does not function in isolation.

Cuts to:
- local authority social care  
- supported and residential provision  
- housing support  
- youth, arts, and community services  

have removed preventative infrastructure. When social care collapses, health services absorb the damage later — at greater cost and severity.

This is not over-medicalisation.  
It is upstream failure.

---

### 8. Housing, health, and collective responsibility  
Health outcomes cannot be separated from housing conditions.

In the UK:
- much housing stock is poorly insulated  
- many homes are expensive or impossible to heat adequately  
- cold and damp worsen respiratory illness and immune vulnerability  
- excess winter deaths and flu mortality have risen  
- severe outcomes, including deaths linked to mould, have occurred  

These are environmental determinants of health — not individual failings.

---

### 9. Historical amnesia and the loss of solidarity  
Post-war Britain treated housing and health as collective responsibilities.

Emergency construction after the Blitz accepted imperfection in order to prioritise shelter. Many current housing problems are the long tail of those decisions, compounded by decades of underinvestment.

To moralise illness now, while refusing collective repair, is not continuity with the “home front” ethic. It is its abandonment.

---

### 10. False scarcity and wealth disparity  
This is not an argument for reckless public spending.

It is an argument about **where resources have been directed**.

Over the past 50 years, UK policy has:
- favoured wealth accumulation at the top  
- widened income and asset disparity  
- pooled resources away from the majority  

The vast majority of people cannot self-fund modernisation, adaptation, or resilience while wealth continues to concentrate elsewhere.

Scarcity is being experienced — but it is not natural.

---

### 11. Independence requires material conditions  
If policymakers were genuinely concerned about over-medicalisation, the most effective intervention would be **greater material independence**.

People rely less on crisis diagnosis when they have:
- secure, warm housing  
- adequate income  
- community infrastructure  
- room to adapt their lives  

Independence is not an attitude.  
It is a resource condition.

---

### 12. Selective fiscal outrage  
Political pressure is disproportionately applied to:
- disabled people  
- welfare claimants  
- public services  

While comparatively little attention is paid to:
- large-scale tax avoidance  
- offshore asset shielding  
- tolerated capital flight  

If fiscal restraint were truly the principle, these practices would be addressed with equal urgency.

They are not.

---

### 13. What the rhetoric actually does  
Taken together, the function of “over-diagnosis” rhetoric becomes clear.

It:
- individualises structural harm  
- shifts blame away from austerity and inequality  
- recodes system failure as personal weakness  
- undermines solidarity while claiming responsibility  

It persists not because it is evidentiary, but because it is useful.
