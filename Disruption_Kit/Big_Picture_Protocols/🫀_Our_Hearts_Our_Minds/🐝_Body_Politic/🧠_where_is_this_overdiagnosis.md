# 🧠 Where Is This “Over-Diagnosis”?
**First created:** 2025-12-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-16  
*A diagnostic challenge to a political claim that refuses to specify itself.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
UK politicians repeatedly claim there is an “over-diagnosis” of mental health and disability — yet rarely specify **where**, **by whom**, **in relation to what baseline**, or **with what evidentiary threshold**.

This node interrogates that absence.

Rather than accepting “over-diagnosis” as a neutral concern, it treats it as a **floating accusation**: rhetorically powerful, statistically vague, and politically useful. The purpose here is not to deny diagnostic error exists, but to ask a prior and more disciplined question:

> *Where, exactly, is this over-diagnosis supposed to be happening?*

Until that question is answered, the claim remains ideological, not analytical.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Separates clinical concepts from political rhetoric  
- Identifies category errors in public debate  
- Re-centres burden of proof on those making the claim  
- Establishes why vagueness itself is doing political work

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. A claim without coordinates  
“Over-diagnosis” is presented as if it were self-evident. It is not.

In serious medical or statistical contexts, such a claim would require:
- a reference population  
- a comparison baseline  
- diagnostic criteria under review  
- evidence of systematic misapplication  
- demonstration of net harm  

In political speech, none of these are usually supplied.

Instead, the term is allowed to float — detached from discipline, but heavy with implication.

---

### 2. Over-diagnosed compared to *what*?  
There are several distinct phenomena routinely collapsed into one accusation:

- Increased recognition of previously underdiagnosed groups  
- Expanded diagnostic criteria reflecting better evidence  
- Post-crisis prevalence changes (e.g. post-COVID effects)  
- Increased access to assessment  
- Reduced stigma leading to help-seeking  

None of these are synonymous with over-diagnosis.

Failure to disaggregate them is not a minor error. It is the entire mechanism by which the rhetoric functions.

---

### 3. Measurement change is not pathology inflation  
A recurring category error in this debate is the assumption that:

> *More diagnoses = too many diagnoses*

This ignores a basic statistical reality: when measurement improves, counts rise — even if underlying prevalence was always there.

Politicians routinely speak as if earlier undercounting represented “normality,” and current visibility represents excess. That is not neutrality. It is a bias toward historical neglect.

---

### 4. The missing comparator: unmet need  
Notably absent from “over-diagnosis” rhetoric is any sustained discussion of:
- unmet mental health need  
- long waiting lists  
- crisis-only access  
- demographic disparities  
- diagnostic delay and attrition  

If diagnosis were truly excessive, one would expect evidence of saturation. What we observe instead is bottlenecking, rationing, and exhaustion.

The system does not behave like one overwhelmed by frivolous demand. It behaves like one struggling to meet real need.

---

### 5. Vagueness as a political asset  
The power of the term “over-diagnosis” lies precisely in its lack of specificity.

Because it is undefined, it can be used to:
- imply malingering without naming it  
- signal austerity without justifying it  
- undermine care without proposing alternatives  
- shift blame from systems to individuals  

A precise claim could be evaluated.  
A vague one can be endlessly repeated.

---

### 6. Who bears the burden of proof?  
In evidence-based disciplines, the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim.

In political discourse, that burden is quietly reversed:
- disabled people must prove they are *not* over-diagnosed  
- clinicians must defend ordinary practice  
- patients must justify access to care  

This inversion is not accidental. It is how withdrawal of care is normalised without openly arguing for it.

---

### 7. Why this question matters  
Asking “where is this over-diagnosis?” is not pedantry.

It is a refusal to allow:
- moral discomfort to masquerade as data  
- cost anxiety to pose as clinical concern  
- ideology to hide inside neutral-sounding language  

Until the claim is specified, it should not be treated as serious policy input.
