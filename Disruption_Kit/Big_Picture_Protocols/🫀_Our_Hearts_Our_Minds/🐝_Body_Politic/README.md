*Cluster on disability, embodiment, and the politics of dignity in the Polaris Protocol.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

The **Body Politic** cluster tracks how disabled people are marked, contained, surveilled, and aestheticised — and how dignity, refusal, and swarm care undo those logics.  

Disability is not niche. Every living person is **temporarily able-bodied**; unless death comes suddenly, disablement is the majority future. Yet even in emancipated spaces, disability remains the insult of choice. Ableism is not incidental — it is the **root script of eugenics** still playing in everyday life.  

This cluster insists: **you cannot dismantle capitalism, fascism, or colonialism without dismantling ableism.**

*🐝 Body Politic* is a living cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates disability as a systemic axis: where exploitation converges, where eugenics persists, and where dignity and refusal generate counterforce.
