# ♿ Containment by Pity  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*How compassion is weaponised into control.*  

---

## 📖 Definition  

Pity looks like kindness, but it contains. Disabled people are “allowed” resources only if they accept pity first. “Poor thing” logics tether survival to compliance.  

---

## 🌀 Patterns  

- **Charity frame:** support tied to infantilisation (“brave little fighter”).  
- **Welfare gatekeeping:** benefits awarded only if you narrate maximum suffering.  
- **Narrative trap:** media prefers pity porn to dignity.  
- **Surveillance creep:** pity justifies monitoring (“for their own good”).  

---

## 🌱 Counterforce  

- **Refuse pity:** demand parity, not charity.  
- **Narrative dignity:** reject “tragic hero” framing.  
- **Redistribute care:** care as pollination, not condescension.

*Containment by Pity* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how pity disguises control, and asserts refusal as the path to dignity.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
