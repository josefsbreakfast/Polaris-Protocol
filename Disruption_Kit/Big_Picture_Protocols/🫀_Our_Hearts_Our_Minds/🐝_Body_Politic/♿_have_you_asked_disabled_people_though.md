# ♿ Have You Asked Disabled People, Though?
**First created:** 2025-12-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-16  
*Why disability justice is not an add-on, a stakeholder box, or a rhetorical flourish — but the starting point.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Public debate about disability, diagnosis, welfare, and cost routinely proceeds **without disabled people** as decision-makers.

This absence is often masked by:
- selective consultation  
- symbolic representation  
- hand-picked voices  
- post-hoc justification  

This node insists on a simple corrective question:

> *Have you actually asked disabled people — broadly, materially, and with power attached?*

Disability justice is not a moral garnish. It is a framework for governance, ethics, and survival.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Centres disability justice as foundational, not supplementary  
- Identifies performative consultation and proxy advocacy  
- Reasserts “nothing about us without us” as a governance principle  
- Grounds the series in lived authority, not abstraction  

---

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. Disability justice is not disability policy  
Disability justice is not:
- a checklist  
- a diversity initiative  
- a consultation exercise  
- a compensatory afterthought  

It is a political framework developed by disabled people — particularly those marginalised by race, class, gender, and poverty — to address **structural harm**, not surface inclusion.

Treating it as an add-on guarantees failure.

---

### 2. “Nothing about us without us” is not a slogan  
The principle “nothing about us without us” is often quoted and rarely honoured.

Honouring it would mean:
- disabled people shaping policy goals  
- disabled people defining problems  
- disabled people holding decision-making power  
- disabled people being believed about harm  

Instead, disabled people are frequently:
- consulted after decisions are made  
- invited to validate pre-existing agendas  
- ignored when inconvenient  
- overridden when costs are named  

That is not participation.  
It is extraction.

---

### 3. Proxy voices and selective listening  
A common manoeuvre in disability discourse is **proxy advocacy**.

This includes:
- elevating a narrow subset of disabled voices  
- privileging those least disruptive to power  
- citing misdiagnosis narratives to undermine access  
- presenting partial experiences as universal truth  

This is not representation.  
It is instrumentalisation.

Disability justice rejects the idea that some disabled people can be used to discipline others.

---

### 4. Lived experience is not anecdotal noise  
Disabled testimony is often dismissed as:
- emotional  
- subjective  
- biased  

Yet disabled people are the only group with:
- continuous exposure to the system  
- cumulative knowledge of its failure modes  
- direct understanding of how policy translates into harm  

Ignoring that knowledge is not neutrality.  
It is epistemic exclusion.

---

### 5. The ten principles of disability justice (briefly)  
Disability justice frameworks emphasise:
- leadership of those most impacted  
- intersectionality  
- anti-capitalist politics  
- collective access  
- interdependence  
- sustainability  
- commitment to cross-movement solidarity  

These principles are not abstract ideals.  
They are survival strategies forged under constraint.

---

### 6. Independence is not the opposite of interdependence  
Mainstream policy fetishises independence.

Disability justice recognises that:
- all humans are interdependent  
- independence is scaffolded by infrastructure  
- pretending otherwise hides who pays the cost  

Systems that punish dependence do not create freedom.  
They create precarity.

---

### 7. Why “over-diagnosis” collapses under disability justice  
From a disability justice perspective, the “over-diagnosis” claim fails immediately.

Because it:
- is made without disabled leadership  
- ignores structural pressure  
- individualises system failure  
- undermines collective access  
- invites suspicion and punishment  

A justice framework asks a different question:
> *What conditions make diagnosis necessary for survival?*

---

### 8. Who decides what counts as harm?  
In current governance, harm is often defined by:
- budget lines  
- productivity metrics  
- political optics  

Disability justice insists harm be defined by:
- lived consequence  
- preventable suffering  
- risk of death or institutionalisation  
- loss of dignity and agency  

These definitions are incompatible.

That tension is political — not accidental.

---

### 9. Consultation without power is containment  
Inviting disabled people to speak without giving them power is not inclusion.

It is:
- reputational shielding  
- risk management  
- legitimacy laundering  

Disability justice requires **transfer of authority**, not testimony on demand.

---

### 10. The core question that keeps returning  
Every node in this series ultimately circles the same failure:

Policies are designed *about* disabled people,  
*for* disabled people,  
*in the name of* disabled people —  

but not **by** disabled people.

Until that changes, diagnosis will be policed, poverty will be medicalised, and justice will remain rhetorical.

*♿ Have You Asked Disabled People, Though?* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It grounds the series in disability justice, insisting that authority, knowledge, and design begin with those most affected.
