# 🏥 Spec Sheet for Dignity: Re-Institutionalisation Creep

*Rejecting the slow return of hospital logics into everyday disabled life.*

## 📖 Definition  

Re-institutionalisation creep is the stealth return of institutional logics into disabled life.  
Even after the hard-won gains of deinstitutionalisation, the hospital follows us home: beige chairs, grey plastic, “minimum function” kit that overwrites the person with the aid.  

It is not sudden. It arrives slowly: through procurement channels, algorithmic search poisoning, austerity logics, and crises like the pandemic. Disabled people live outside the institution but remain contained by its aesthetics, assumptions, and defaults.  

The *Spec Sheet for Dignity* is the counterforce: a demand that adaptive gear meet the standards of style, parity, and dignity that able-bodied people take for granted.

## ⏳ Historical Anchors  

- **1970s–1990s — Deinstitutionalisation:** Disabled rights and independent living movements secure housing, ramps, and mobility beyond the ward.  
- **2000s–2010s — Performance parity:** Titanium ultralight chairs, sport prosthetics, adaptive ski rigs, Motability builds with real design parity. Disabled kit briefly looked like it belonged in the same world as everyone else’s.  
- **2010s — Austerity regression:** Government cuts slash budgets; procurement agencies select only the cheapest gear. Specialist designers fold. Market floods with clinical beige.  
- **2020s — Pandemic acceleration:** emergency buying, mass closures, and online retail algorithms collapse visibility of high-quality adaptive design. Small firms disappear; big suppliers churn out hospital-grade junk.  
- **2020–2025 — Steroid able-bodiedness:** Design defaults double down on “normal bodies.” Adaptive equipment is shoved back into patient logics, reversing decades of dignity gains.

## 🌀 Patterns of Creep  

- **Algorithmic poisoning:** Search “monoski” or “swivel seat” and you’ll drown in able-bodied gear or geriatric aids. Adaptive dignity vanishes from results.  
- **Aesthetic erasure:** Wheelchairs regress to clunky, medicalised frames. High-performance builds fall out of visibility.  
- **Procurement tunnel vision:** Motability and NHS funding funnel into cheapest possible adaptations, not person-first design.  
- **Identity overwrite:** Person becomes “the chair,” “the rig,” “the aid.” You stop being Chloe — formidable woman — and become “the wheelchair.”  
- **Cultural amnesia:** Society forgets deinstitutionalisation was about dignity, not just cheaper housing.

## 🏎️ Spec Sheet for Dignity — Transport  

- **Ferrari-seat swivel bases, not dialysis-chair retrofits.**  
- **Programmable six-way motion** (fore/aft, tilt, recline, height, swivel, lateral adjust).  
- **Luxury upholstery and finish:** leather, Alcantara, bold stitching.  
- **Crash-tested + EMC compliant** — no compromise on safety.  
- **Integration with motability scheme** without penalising “aesthetics.”  

---

## 🐎 Spec Sheet for Dignity — Equestrian  

- **Side-saddle parity:** option to ride left or right, not just the “ladylike” historical posture.  
- **Adaptive rigging:** stirrups, straps, and balance aids tailored to *bodies as they are*, not tradition.  
- **Reject equestrian etiquette as containment:** riding is sport, not re-enactment.  

---

## 🎿 Spec Sheet for Dignity — Snow Sports  

- **Adaptive rigs equal to able-bodied skis and boards:** not afterthoughts, not “special needs” sleds.  
- **Disabled monoskis visible in mainstream sport catalogues, not hidden away.**  
- **Durability for high use:** 40+ hours a week on slopes should be baseline.  

---

## ♿ Spec Sheet for Dignity — Wheelchairs  

- **Ultralight frames, custom titanium, sleek designs.**  
- **Aesthetic integration:** colourways, spoke guards, textiles that match clothing and identity.  
- **Disappearance effect:** the chair supports but does not overwrite — people see *you* before the metal.  
- **Reject clinical beige:** no more “hospital corridor chic” as the default.  

---

## 📡 Meta-Spec: Core Principles  

Across all domains:  

- **Aesthetic parity** — design should meet the cultural standard of non-disabled equivalents.  
- **Functional parity** — full adjustability, performance grade, durability.  
- **Safety parity** — crash tested, standards compliant, robust.  
- **Cultural parity** — mobility aids should enhance identity, not overwrite it.
