*Political masculinity capture during and after COVID as a failure of grief, ritual, and permitted male care*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines how large numbers of men became politically capturable during and after the COVID pandemic — not primarily through ideology, but through **unprocessed fear, grief, and blocked masculine expression**.

The claim here is not that men are uniquely violent, irrational, or culpable.  
It is that a specific historical shock collided with rigid gender norms, producing a **structural vulnerability** that political and economic systems rapidly exploited.

COVID did not invent this weakness.  
It exposed and intensified it.

## ✨ Key Features  

- Separates masculinity capture from QAnon and alt-right pipelines  
- Frames cognitive rigidity as a trauma response, not stupidity  
- Links grief suppression to aggression and certainty-seeking  
- Explains why compassion became feminised and taboo for men  
- Connects masculinity insecurity to surveillance-capital extraction

## 🧿 COVID as a Masculinity Stress Test  

For many men, the pandemic removed core routes through which masculinity is ordinarily stabilised:

- providing materially  
- protecting family or community  
- acting decisively in the face of threat  
- being physically competent and socially effective  

At the same time, it introduced:
- uncontrollable risk  
- enforced passivity  
- institutional failure  
- persistent background fear  

Men were still expected to be strong —  
while being structurally prevented from *acting*.

That contradiction matters.

## 🪦 The Absence of Ritualised Grief  

Human societies rely on **ritualised grief** to prevent loss from hardening into rage.

During and after COVID:
- deaths were numerically abstracted  
- mourning was privatised or rushed  
- collective grief rituals were absent or discouraged  
- fear had no socially permitted discharge  

Grief without ritual does not dissipate.  
It calcifies.

What cannot be mourned is often defended against.

## 🧱 Cognitive Rigidity as a Trauma Response  

The post-COVID increase in cognitive rigidity among men is not primarily ideological.

It is physiological and psychological:

- threat narrows perception  
- ambiguity becomes intolerable  
- binaries feel stabilising  
- hierarchy feels clarifying  

In this state:
- compassion is misread as weakness  
- flexibility feels like loss of status  
- care becomes feminised and policed  

Certainty becomes soothing — even when it is false.

## 🧲 Why This Is Bigger Than QAnon  

QAnon and overt extremist movements captured *some* men.  
They are not the whole story.

Many men who:
- never joined extremist groups  
- do not identify as far-right  
- reject conspiratorial thinking  

still show:
- heightened defensiveness  
- gender anxiety  
- hostility to care-based politics  
- susceptibility to rage-bait framing  

The capture here is **affective**, not doctrinal.

---

## 🐦 The Lie About “Male Biology”  

Manosphere discourse claims biological realism while rejecting observable biology.

In species with male/female phenotypes:
- males routinely display tenderness, patience, play, and care  
- courtship behaviours often involve ornamentation and vulnerability  
- rigidity and dominance are contextual, not constant  

Compassion and relational behaviour are not unmasculine.  
They are biologically ordinary.

What is new is the cultural policing of male softness.

---

## 🪤 Masculinity as an Extractable Resource  

This is where capitalism enters cleanly.

Surveillance capitalism does not seek to stabilise masculinity.  
It seeks to **monetise insecurity**.

Male anxiety about:
- sexual status  
- relevance  
- dominance  
- respect  

is treated as:
- a targeting vector  
- an engagement engine  
- a renewable extractive resource  

Rage, grievance, and defensive identity are continuously baited because they:
- increase dwell time  
- reduce critical distance  
- heighten dependency  

Extraction thrives on instability.  
Stability would end the revenue stream.

---

## 🧭 What This Does *Not* Do for Men  

Political masculinity capture offers:
- symbolic dominance without material security  
- enemies without agency  
- identity without grounding  

It keeps men:
- vigilant but powerless  
- angry but dependent  
- mobilised but unsatisfied  

None of this restores masculinity.  
Restoration is not the objective.

---

## 🕯️ Where This Leaves Us  

This is not a call to shame men or dismiss male fear.

It is a call to recognise that:
- grief was not metabolised  
- care was feminised and forbidden  
- protection instincts were blocked  
- rage was harvested instead  

The question forward is not “how do men reassert dominance?”  
It is:

> How do we build cultures where male fear and grief can be expressed  
> without being converted into violence, hierarchy, or extraction?

Animals with complex brains grieve.  
Humans are not exempt — we are simply under-ritualised.
