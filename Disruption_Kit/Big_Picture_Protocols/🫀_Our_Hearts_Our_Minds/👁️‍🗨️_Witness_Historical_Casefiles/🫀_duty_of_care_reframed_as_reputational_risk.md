# 🫀 Duty of care reframed as reputational risk  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*How care obligations are displaced by optics-focused governance.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents a structural inversion in governance systems:  
**duty of care obligations are reframed as reputational risks**, rather than ethical or legal responsibilities.

When this inversion occurs, systems optimise for appearance rather than wellbeing or fairness.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Care treated as liability  
- Harm mitigation subordinated to optics  
- Individuals reframed as exposure vectors  
- Defensive compliance replacing substantive care  
- Ethical obligations displaced by brand logic  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. The inversion mechanism  

Originally:
> *Duty of care exists to protect people.*

After inversion:
> **Duty of care exists to protect the institution from blame.**

This shift subtly but profoundly alters decision-making.

---

### 2. Effects on affected individuals  

When care is reframed as risk:
- engagement becomes guarded  
- support becomes conditional  
- timelines stretch  
- responsibility is deflected  

The individual experiences abandonment by process.

---

### 3. Why systems justify this shift  

Internally, institutions rationalise the inversion as:
- legal prudence  
- risk management  
- consistency  
- neutrality  

But these rationales obscure the loss of **relational and ethical grounding**.

---

### 4. Long-term damage  

This reframing erodes:
- trust  
- legitimacy  
- institutional memory  
- and moral authority  

The system protects itself while hollowing out its purpose.
