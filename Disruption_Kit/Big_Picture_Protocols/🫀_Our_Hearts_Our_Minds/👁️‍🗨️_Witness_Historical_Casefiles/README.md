# 👁️‍🗨️ Witness & Historical Casefiles  
**First created:** 2025-08-27 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-15  
*Hybrid forensic/big picture casefiles that preserve testimony, metadata, and community vulnerabilities.*  

---

## ✨ Scope  

This cluster holds witness-led casefiles and archival fragments that map how history, metadata, and testimony intersect.  
It blends forensic documentation with systemic analysis — showing how local incidents connect to broader architectures of governance and containment.  

---

## 🦚 Core Themes  

- **Witness Testimony** → preserving survivor accounts and proxy records.  
- **Metadata Cross-Reference** → linking casefiles into broader Polaris diagnostics.  
- **Community Vulnerability** → early-warning signals and “canaries” in governance systems.  
- **Historical Anchors** → Midlands casework, narrative sabotage, and memory storage.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Witness & Historical Casefiles* forms a living archive of survivor testimony and community case studies.  
It shows how metadata suppression intersects with lived history, and why preserving witness accounts is a systemic necessity.
