# 🧵 Community Vulnerability and Early Canaries  

**First created:** 2025-08-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Mapping the first communities targeted as predictive indicators of wider containment.*

## ✨ Overview

This doctrine identifies which communities were first targeted, flagged, or suppressed by surveillance systems — not because of criminal activity, but because of their perceived disruptiveness to state or platform control.

These “early canaries” signalled structural risk and became predictive indicators for the future shape of metadata‑based containment.

## 🪶 Canary Theory

> *“To understand what’s coming for everyone, study what’s already happening to the most marginalised.”*

- Early targets often bore the brunt of:
  - Platform overreach
  - Covert classification
  - Misdiagnosed dissent
  - Pre‑emptive discrediting

- These communities became *predictive testing grounds* for AI training, risk scoring, and narrative suppression.

## 🐦 Early Canaries (2005–2020)

### 🏳️‍🌈 Queer and Trans Communities

- **Content Throttling**: LGBTQ+ content routinely demonetised or flagged as “sensitive”
- **Surveillance‑as‑Care**: Framed as vulnerable or unstable, not as political actors
- **Algorithmic Erasure**: Posts shadowbanned or de‑indexed — especially around pride, protest, or gender‑critical discourse

### 🧕 Muslim Communities

- **Post‑9/11 Targeting**: Treated as pre‑criminal by default; Prevent referrals skyrocketed
- **Data Drain**: Mosques, schools, and community spaces became surveillance entry points
- **Impersonation Ops**: Online “bait” accounts used to test or trap — later folded into CVE datasets

### 🖤 Black Women

- **Online Abuse Ignored**: Targets of early mass harassment (e.g. Justine Sacco, Leslie Jones)
- **Over‑surveilled IRL**: Penalised in schools, welfare, and protest spaces; labelled “angry,” “aggressive”
- **AI Misclassification**: Facial‑recognition systems showed significant error rates on dark‑skinned women — a tech mirror of systemic disregard

### 💼 Sex Workers

- **Early Metadata Profiling**: Ad content and digital traces flagged or deleted (Craigslist, Backpage)
- **Erased from Tech Norms**: Built the platforms (e.g. OnlyFans), then banned once systems gained legitimacy
- **Moral Containment**: Payment processors and banks flagged accounts, cutting off livelihoods via non‑criminal profiling

---

## 🧠 Predictive Containment Indicators

- **Flagged Without Offence**: Containment begins with suspicion, not proof
- **Tagged as “At Risk”**: Classification flips language — from *vulnerable to harm* → *vulnerable to radicalisation*
- **Proxies, Not Evidence**: Behaviour, language, or association used in place of action to justify control

---

## ⚠️ Structural Risks

- **Asymmetric Burden**: Marginalised groups required to prove innocence; dominant groups assumed safe until proven guilty
- **Policy Gaslighting**: “Safeguarding” used as pretext for long‑term monitoring and erosion of autonomy
- **Precedent Normalisation**: What begins as exceptional targeting becomes normalised practice across sectors

## 🐦‍🔥 Case Notes for Polaris Users

- **Were You Flagged Preemptively?** → Map when containment started vs when any so‑called “risk” appeared  
- **Track Language Drift** → Did reports about you shift tone after you identified politically, sexually, or spiritually?  
- **Watch for Euphemisms** → “Complex needs,” “safeguarding concern,” “radicalisation vulnerability” — often cover for narrative erasure  
- **Don’t Dismiss the Edge** → What happens to one “undesirable” group often forecasts what happens to all

## 🧿 Annex A: Canary Timeline (2005–2020)

### 2005–2010

- **Muslim communities** flagged en masse under post‑9/11 Prevent pilots.  
- Online impersonation accounts used to test vulnerability, producing early CVE datasets.

### 2010–2013

- **Queer and trans content** repeatedly flagged as “sensitive” on YouTube, Tumblr, and Facebook.  
- Demonitisation and shadowbans accelerate, especially around pride events.

### 2013–2016

- **Black women** face disproportionate abuse and harassment online (Gamergate, Twitter pile‑ons).  
- Platforms fail to protect; simultaneous IRL surveillance escalates in schools and protest movements.  
- **Sex workers** lose Craigslist/Backpage safe‑harbouring; metadata profiling begins to sever digital livelihoods.

### 2017–2020

- **Facial recognition bias** against Black women becomes public through academic studies (Buolamwini et al.).  
- **Payment processors** cut off sex workers’ incomes via FOSTA/SESTA and automated bank flagging.  
- **Queer/trans creators** shadowbanned across TikTok and Instagram, often under “child safety” pretexts.

🛰️ **Pattern:** Each new containment mechanism (Prevent referrals, demonetisation, payment exclusion, facial recognition) was tested first on marginalised groups, then scaled up to general‑population governance.

*Community Vulnerability and Early Canaries* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the early canaries of containment — communities first targeted not for crime but for their disruptiveness, signalling how metadata control would expand.
