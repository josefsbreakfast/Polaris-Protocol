## 📅 2020 — Immediate Uptake  

- **May – June:** Solidarity protests in London, Bristol, Glasgow, Cardiff (~200+ events). Public focus on policing and colonial memory.  
- **7 June:** Edward Colston statue toppled in Bristol — symbolic rupture in public memory.  
- **Parliamentary output:** Debates (Commons 8 Jun, Lords 15 Jun) acknowledge scale of protest.  
- **Media:** national coverage shifts from solidarity to order narratives.  
- **Cultural:** #BlackOutTuesday (2 Jun) marks digital solidarity and algorithmic throttling.

- **Civil-society reflections:** “Reckoning with Racism & Inequality” reports (Bond, Amnesty).  

---

## 📅 2025 — Re-Justification & Containment  

- **“Political Impartiality” guidance** issued to schools and public bodies, limiting activism.

## 🧭 Analytic Continuities  

1. **Symbolic to Structural:** BLM moment → institutional plans → bureaucratic stall.  
2. **Containment Learning:** state and media develop templates for absorbing outrage.  
3. **Substitution:** race → security → Palestine → “woke risk.”  
4. **Re-justification:** racism returns as “safety policy.”
