# 🧬 Successor Firms After the SCL / Cambridge Analytica Collapse  
**First created:** 2025-09-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Mapping the dispersal lineage post-ICO raids.*  

---

## ✨ Core Idea  
The 2018 raids on SCL/Cambridge Analytica scattered personnel, data, and methods. The *brand* was burned, but the *behavioural playbook* metastasised into a web of successor firms, shell companies, and quiet consultancies.  

---

## 🗺️ Successor Node Map  

- **SCL Group**  
  - Umbrella organisation, hub for behavioural psyops.  

- **SCL Defence**  
  - Military / CVE arm. Contracted to MoD, NATO, US DoD.  
  - Formally shut with the group, but staff + practices reabsorbed elsewhere.  

- **Cambridge Analytica**  
  - Political campaign arm. Targeting and psychographic profiling.  
  - Insolvent 2018 after raids.  

---

### **Post-Raid Successors**  

- **Emerdata Ltd**  
  - UK holding company created 2017, populated by ex-CA execs + Mercer family.  
  - Low-profile continuity vessel for intellectual property.  

- **Auspex International**  
  - Founded by Mark Turnbull (ex-CA).  
  - Strategic comms and “ethical” influence consulting.  

- **Data Propria**  
  - US-based, staffed by former CA employees.  
  - Active in Republican political work post-2018.  

- **AggregateIQ (AIQ)**  
  - Canadian subcontractor tied to Brexit campaigns.  
  - Survived scandal and continued operating.  

- **Other Spin-offs**  
  - Micro-labs: Clear AI, Vibrant Data.  
  - Defence/CVE consultancies taking in SCL Defence diaspora.  
  - Embedded staff into think tanks and NGOs under “disinformation resilience” banners.  

---

## 🧨 Key Takeaway  
- The collapse created **spectacle and insolvency**, but not erasure.  
- Capabilities splintered into smaller, less visible entities.  
- Practices rebranded as **online harms**, **resilience**, **counter-extremism**.
