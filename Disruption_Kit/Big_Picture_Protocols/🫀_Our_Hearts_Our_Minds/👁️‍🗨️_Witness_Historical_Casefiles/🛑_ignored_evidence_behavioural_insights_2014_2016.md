# 🛑 Ignored Evidence Node — Behavioural Insights 2014–2016  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Records how evidence presented to the House of Lords Science & Technology Committee (2014 follow-up on Behaviour Change) raised sensible cautions, yet policy practice largely ignored them.*  

---

## ✨ Summary  
Between 2014–2016, the House of Lords Science & Technology Committee revisited the UK’s behavioural insights agenda. Witnesses from academia, civil society, and government departments raised measured cautions: nudges were over-sold, ethically opaque, and insufficient for major challenges.  

Despite these, government practice barely shifted. This node outlines the cautions, the reasons they were sidelined, and the systemic implications.

## 🧿 Observed Cautions in Evidence  
- **Over-sold results:** small compliance uplifts framed as transformative; long-term effects unproven.  
- **Cheap fix temptation:** nudges politically attractive but risked substituting for regulation or investment.  
- **Equity risks:** vulnerable groups disproportionately affected, sometimes harmed.  
- **Transparency gap:** citizens often unaware of behavioural design shaping choices.  
- **Insufficient for structural issues:** obesity, smoking, inequality require fiscal/regulatory levers.  
- **Democratic legitimacy:** covert nudging risks undermining trust.  

**Witnesses included:**  
- Prof. Theresa Marteau (Cambridge, Behaviour & Health Research Unit)  
- Prof. David Metz (UCL, transport)  
- Prof. Mike Kelly (NICE)  
- Civil liberties groups (Liberty, Open Rights Group, via written submissions)  
- Lords committee members (Krebs, Selborne, Hilton, Patel)

## ❓ Why Evidence Was Ignored — Structural Dynamics  
1. **Political appetite for cheap fixes**  
   - Austerity made nudges attractive: low-cost, quick wins, no new taxes.  
2. **Enthusiasm bias**  
   - BIT as a world-first export and soft-power brand; limits threatened the narrative.  
3. **Evaluation asymmetry**  
   - Nudges produced measurable uplifts; structural policies slower and harder to evidence.  
4. **Weak champions for critiques**  
   - Academics/NGOs lacked institutional pull compared to HMRC, DWP, Cabinet Office.  
5. **Procedural absorption**  
   - Committees “noted” cautions; departments filed them as considered, then ignored.  
6. **Timing and political climate**  
   - By 2015–2016, Brexit pressures dominated; behavioural messaging seen as politically useful.

## 🛰️ Implications  
- **Institutional fork:** evidence of ethical/practical limits existed, yet policy design pressed ahead.  
- **Democratic cost:** scrutiny bodies surface warnings, but without enforcement power they are sidelined.  
- **Strategic lesson:** documenting ignored evidence matters — it shows how inertia and political convenience override caution.
