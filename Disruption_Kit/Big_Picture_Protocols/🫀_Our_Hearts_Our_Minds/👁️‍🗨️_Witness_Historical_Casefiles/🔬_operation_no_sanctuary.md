**First created:** 2025-09-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Diagnostic node on the Newcastle child sexual exploitation prosecutions and their institutional implications.*  

---

## 🧿 Overview  
Operation Sanctuary (later Shelter) was Northumbria Police’s flagship investigation into group-based child sexual exploitation in Newcastle (2014 onwards).  

- **Convictions (2017):** 17 men + 1 woman guilty of rape, trafficking, and supplying drugs.  
- **Victims:** at least 22 young women and girls, many groomed through alcohol/drugs.  
- **National context:** parallels Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford → systemic minimisation of early warnings.  

---

## 🛰️ Timeline  
- **Pre-2014:** Local services note vulnerabilities; inconsistent police response.  
- **2014:** Northumbria Police launch Operation Sanctuary; intelligence sweep identifies extensive CSE network.  
- **2015–2017:** Trials across four sittings.  
- **2017:** Guilty verdicts; sentences up to 20+ years.  
- **2018:** Serious Case Review (David Spicer) finds earlier responses “lacked consistency and impact.”  
- **2018:** Controversy over police use of convicted rapist as paid informant.  

---

## ⚖️ Institutional Patterns  
- **Silence/inaction pre-2014:** Victim reports not escalated; safeguarding gaps.  
- **Post-2014 surge:** Multi-agency coordination; high national visibility.  
- **Controversial tactics:** Paid informant undermined public trust.  
- **Review lessons:** need for stronger inter-agency intelligence and cultural recognition of grooming models.  

---

## 🧨 Signals of Wider Systemic Issues  
- **Comparative failures:** Echoes of Rotherham → concerns suppressed for reputational protection.  
- **Prevent intersection:** institutional attention skewed toward extremism risk, away from exploitation.  
- **Exploitation typologies:** grooming linked with drugs, debt bondage, county lines models.
