# 🧱 System-literate actors and fatigue-curve failure  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*Why some actors do not disengage when institutions expect them to.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines **fatigue-curve failure**:  
the breakdown of institutional assumptions that complainants or escalators will disengage under sustained procedural friction.

System-literate actors do not follow expected attrition patterns because their engagement is driven by obligation, not emotional endurance.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Persistence beyond expected timelines  
- Familiarity with institutional processes  
- Non-reactive escalation behaviour  
- Predictive model failure within governance systems  
- Escalation without burnout  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. The institutional fatigue assumption  

Most systems assume a predictable curve:

> escalation → delay → friction → withdrawal

This assumption underpins many delay-based strategies.

---

### 2. Why system literacy breaks the curve  

System-literate actors:
- understand procedural timelines  
- anticipate delay tactics  
- expect institutional resistance  
- document methodically  

As a result, friction does not signal defeat — it signals **process**.

---

### 3. Persistence as structural, not emotional  

These actors persist because:
- the obligation remains unmet  
- the issue remains unresolved  
- disengagement would violate internal coherence  

Persistence is therefore **normative**, not reactive.

---

### 4. Consequences of fatigue-curve failure  

When fatigue curves fail:
- delay strategies backfire  
- risk accumulates instead of dissipating  
- institutions are forced to reclassify the actor  
- escalation becomes inevitable  

This often precipitates hinge points described elsewhere in the protocol.

*System-literate actors and fatigue-curve failure* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents why some actors persist beyond institutional expectations and how this persistence reshapes risk calculations over time.
