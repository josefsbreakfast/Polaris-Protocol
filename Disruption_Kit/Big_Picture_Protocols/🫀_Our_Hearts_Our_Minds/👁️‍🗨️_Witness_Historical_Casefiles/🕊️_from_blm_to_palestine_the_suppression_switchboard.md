# 🕊️ From BLM to Palestine — The Suppression Switchboard  
**First created:** 2025-10-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*How lessons from the 2020 BLM containment cycle were redeployed in the policing of Palestine solidarity and “woke” dissent.*

---

## ✨ Overview  

This node tracks the **policy, media, and moral substitution** that linked BLM 2020 to the 2023–25 Palestine containment wave.  
It maps how protest management techniques, rhetoric of safety, and loyalty tests migrated intact between arenas.

## 🧿 1. Containment Prototype → Reapplication  

| Stage | BLM 2020 Mechanism | Palestine 2023–25 Reapplication |
|-------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Narrative control | “Riot vs protest” framing | “Extremism / antisemitism” framing |
| Visibility throttling | Algorithmic demotion of hashtags | Platform throttling of Gaza imagery |
| Moral management | “Listen, reflect, educate” | “Condemn, distance, denounce” |
| Legislative armature | COVID Public Order controls | Public Order Act 2023 + National Security Act 2024 |
| Bureaucratic etiquette | Anti-racism training → neutrality policies | Political impartiality guidance (2025) |

The state learned **how to metabolise outrage without yielding power**.

## ⭕️ 2. Substitution Logic  

After BLM, race equality became politically unprofitable;  
“foreign policy civility” offered a new site for moral sorting.

1. **Subject swap:** Black → Brown → Muslim.  
2. **Frame swap:** justice → security.  
3. **Moral cover:** “safety” replaces “equality.”  
4. **Outcome:** continuity of racial governance under a new name.

## 🧨 3. Re-Justification as Safety  

1. BLM exposed systemic racism.  
2. Institutions re-branded control as *care*.  
3. When Palestine erupted, those tools re-activated:  
   - bans, suspensions, protest conditions, visa scrutiny, “hate-risk” training.  
4. Old hierarchies returned, cloaked in humanitarian vocabulary.

---

## 🐉 4. Discursive Markers  

- “Impartiality,” “neutrality,” “civility” = post-2020 euphemisms for silence.  
- “Safety” = permission to exclude.  
- “Extremism” = protest exceeding state-approved empathy.  

---

## 🌋 5. Internal Containment and Deference  

Deference politics reinforced the switchboard: only “safe” marginalised figures were platformed to endorse containment.  
Solidarity fractured along curated identity lines.  

---

## ❌ 6. Strategic Outcome  

> The same machinery that once promised to dismantle racism now maintains it—by redistributing moral legitimacy instead of material change.
