## 🧾 Interpretation  

- **True twins (🧬):** polluted canonical link + displaced working link (e.g., Rotherham).  
- **Quasi-twins:** original disappeared, survives only in archives (e.g., Keighley, Bradford cluster).  
- **Displaced-only:** file exists but is effectively buried in navigation (e.g., Newcastle JSCR).  

Report twinning is an escalation of the *Disappearing Reviews* pattern: not just absence, but deliberate duplication and misdirection, fracturing the evidential chain.

*Report Twinning Index* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It collates instances where inquiry reports exist in parallel forms, documenting how polluted and displaced links fracture accountability.
