# 🕸️ Governance and Mitigation: Token Switching  
**First created:** 2025-09-30 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*For leadership, compliance, and procurement.*  

---

## Why token switching is a governance risk  
- Undermines system integrity.  
- Hides safety threats and creates false audit trails.  
- Breach of trust for survivors and operators alike.  

---

## Immediate governance actions  
- Freeze ID-binding changes unless dual-approved.  
- Require multi-signer approvals for reassignment.  
- Escalate anomalies as integrity incidents (high severity).  

---

## Medium-term mitigations  
- Cryptographic identity binding to prevent silent swaps.  
- Immutable provenance stores (tamper-evident logs).  
- Automatic divergence alerts (when ID attributes change too fast).  
- Regular crosswalk audits across systems.  

---

## Procurement requirements  
- Vendors must demonstrate tamper-evident identity handling.  
- Logging must include actor, IP, and request body for ID changes.  
- Forensic readiness (easy export of all relevant logs).
