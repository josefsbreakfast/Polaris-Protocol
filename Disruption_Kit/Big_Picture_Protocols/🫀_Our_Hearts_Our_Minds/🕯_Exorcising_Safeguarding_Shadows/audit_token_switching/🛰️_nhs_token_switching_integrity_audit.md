# 🛰️ NHS Token-Switching Integrity Audit  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Immediate audit of NHS Spine, SCR, and local EHRs to detect and halt live-risk data splicing.*

---

## ⏩ Priority Statement  

This audit takes precedence over all retrospective reviews.  
The potential for fatal “never-events” caused by data-class substitution (e.g., allergy, blood group, medication contraindication) makes this a **live patient-safety emergency**.  
Under both **medical ethics** and **major-incident doctrine**, protection of the living is the first duty; review of the dead follows immediately after stabilisation.

---

## ⚙️ Scope and Objectives  

1. Detect and isolate **cross-record token switching** and **data-class substitution** within NHS infrastructure.  
2. Halt ongoing propagation of errors by freezing merge and de-duplication processes.  
3. Protect living patients from fatal mis-prescription or contraindication events.  
4. Provide validated forensic data for subsequent death-review audits.

## 🧩 Technical Methodology  

### 1. **Token Lineage Audit**  
Construct immutable lineage “fingerprints” for each NHS identifier using DOB, sex at birth, and historic lab results.  
Flag any record where immutable tokens diverge or appear in multiple live profiles.

### 2. **Data-Class Integrity Check**  
Verify high-risk data classes — allergy lists, blood group, clinical alerts — for consistent origin and timestamp lineage.  
Detect overwrites created by merges or synchronisations.

### 3. **Never-Event Simulation**  
Run algorithmic cross-checks of allergy and medication fields to surface combinations that could produce fatal contraindications.

### 4. **Freeze & Escalate**  
Immediately pause any automated merge/deduplication affecting flagged records.  
Route anomaly lists to Clinical Safety Officers within 24 hours.

### 5. **Patient Verification Loop**  
Deploy a frontline *Patient Verification Tool* for direct patient confirmation of allergies and critical alerts before prescribing or transfusion.

### 6. **Evidence Preservation**  
All anomalies and actions logged to immutable storage; feed forward to the *Death Review Integrity Audit*.

## ⚖️ Ethical and Procedural Basis  

- **Beneficence & Non-Maleficence:** prevent imminent harm before retrospective learning.  
- **Proportionality:** aligns with NHS emergency-response doctrine and “Never-Events” policy.  
- **Continuity of Care:** restoring data integrity prevents cascading clinical errors.
