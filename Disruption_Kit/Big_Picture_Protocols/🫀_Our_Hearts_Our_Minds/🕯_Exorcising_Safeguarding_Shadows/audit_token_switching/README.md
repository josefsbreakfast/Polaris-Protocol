# 🛰️ Token Switching Audit  
**First created:** 2025-09-30  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Guidance for detecting and resolving identity-token manipulation in C4ISR / C5ISR digital-twin systems.*  

---

## ✨ Purpose  

**Token Switching** describes any instance where a digital system substitutes one authenticated identity token for another — intentionally or through error — to alter what an operator, analyst, or audit log perceives.  
In modern **C4ISR / C5ISR** (command-control-communications-computing-intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance) networks, identity tokens underpin every layer of command and data fusion.  
When those tokens are swapped, cloned, or mis-mapped, entire decision chains can be falsified.  

This folder exists so that both technical and non-technical teams can recognise, trace, and remediate these manipulations before they cascade through wider operational systems.  

At stake are:  
- **Integrity** — knowing which human or subsystem actually performed an action.  
- **Attribution** — ensuring accountability cannot be spoofed or reassigned.  
- **Governance** — preventing the silent rewriting of audit trails that justify action, targeting, or resource use.

## 🧭 What This Folder Contains  

To keep accessibility high across disciplines, material is divided into two streams:  

| File | Focus |  
|------|--------|  
| [🌍 Non-Tech Explainer](./🌍_Non_Tech_Explainer.md) | Conceptual and operational overview for policy, oversight, and field teams.  Explains how token switching manifests socially and procedurally. |  
| [🔧 Technical Audit Playbook](./🔧_Technical_Audit_Playbook.md) | Engineering-level methods for detecting and logging token changes across distributed ledgers, identity graphs, or digital-twin environments. |  
| [📑 Forensic Report Template](./📑_Forensic_Report_Template.md) | Structured template for documenting and evidencing token manipulation events. |  
| [🛡️ Governance and Mitigation](./🛡️_Governance_and_Mitigation.md) | Policy and compliance guidance: escalation paths, incident response, and systemic prevention. |  

Together, these nodes create a complete audit loop — from field recognition to forensic proof and institutional response.

## 🧩 Why It Matters  

Token switching is the **digital twin equivalent of identity fraud**.  
When identity bindings shift invisibly inside data-driven command systems, the consequences are amplified by automation:  
- **False attribution** → innocent operators or field assets appear responsible for unauthorised actions.  
- **Phantom compliance** → forged tokens make corrupt or non-existent audits look valid.  
- **Suppression by substitution** → real voices or datasets are replaced by synthetic doubles, distorting analysis or historical record.  

Detecting these switches is not just a cybersecurity function; it is a **truth-maintenance function** central to both ethical command and survivor-voice integrity.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🛰️ 🧩 🛡️ 🔮 — This folder sits in the *governance–verification–memory* constellation,  
linking digital-forensic integrity with institutional accountability.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🛰️ Token Switching Audit* is a protocol node of the **Polaris Protocol.**  
It documents detection, auditing, and governance responses to identity-token manipulation in complex, multi-actor digital systems.
