## ⚡ Immediate Orders  

1. **Freeze data states**  
   - Suspend deletion, merge, deduplication, and reconciliation scripts touching live identifiers.  
   - Apply to all instances: NHS Spine, Summary Care Record, local EHRs, backups, and audit servers.  

2. **Secure immutable snapshots**  
   - Create WORM (write-once-read-many) backups of each affected dataset.  
   - Hash and timestamp each snapshot for verification.  

3. **Register the hold**  
   - Each Trust Data Controller must file a “Legal Hold Register” entry including:  
     - Date/time of hold  
     - Systems affected  
     - Responsible officer  
     - Authorising body  

4. **Notify oversight bodies**  
   - Caldicott Guardians, CQC, MHRA, Coroner Service, and NHS England Patient-Safety Division.  

5. **Suspend related data-migrations**  
   - No synchronisation, replication, or cloud export until forensic clearance is issued.  

6. **Preserve audit logs**  
   - Store separately under cryptographic seal.  
   - Any modification constitutes evidence tampering.  

7. **Communicate transparently**  
   - Inform staff and contracted partners that data are under investigation.  
   - Protect whistle-blowers and clinicians who raise integrity concerns.
