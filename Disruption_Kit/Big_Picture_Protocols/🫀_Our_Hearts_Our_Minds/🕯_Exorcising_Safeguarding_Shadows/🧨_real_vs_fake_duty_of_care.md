**First created:** 2025-09-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Distinguishing legitimate legal complexity from weaponised prolongation.*  

---

## 🏛️ Real Duty of Care (legitimate complexity)  
- **Examples:** Court of Protection cases, High Court decisions.  
- **Features:**  
  - Complex questions about capacity, rights, safeguarding.  
  - Delays caused by legal process and judicial oversight.  
  - Reviews by independent judges.  
  - Aim: balance interventions with autonomy, protection with rights.  
- **Outcome:** Eventually resolved through lawful authority, with accountability.  

---

## 🧨 Fake Duty of Care (weaponised prolongation)  
- **Examples:** Cases kept open on flimsy or vendetta grounds.  
- **Features:**  
  - No lawful basis, no judicial review.  
  - Files sustained by banter, face-saving, inter-office bets.  
  - “Nudges” engineered to create manufactured risk.  
  - Duty-of-care language used as cover for punishment.  
- **Outcome:** Indefinite surveillance, reputational smearing, entanglement of whistleblowers.

## 🧭 Why This Distinction Matters  
- Real duty of care is **law-bound and accountable**.  
- Fake duty of care is **ego-bound and unaccountable**.  
- Confusing the two lets harmful actors hide behind the language of protection.

## 🌱 Repair Imperative  
There are **transformational changes** needed to restore accountability:  
- Real checks on power must be proportionate, lawful, and reviewable.  
- Workers who raise concerns should be **protected even when their concerns are raised imperfectly**.  
- Without this, systemic failures multiply: silence deepens, risks compound, and institutions lose the chance to self-correct.
