## 🧭 Definitions & Framing  

Before tracing history, it’s important to separate **attraction** from **harm**.  
There are individuals who experience pathological attraction to minors and do **not** act upon it.  
That distinction matters — yet the purpose of this node is not to explore inner psychology or attraction itself,  
but to focus on **behaviour**, **harm**, and **risk management**.

Predatory actors — those who act to harm, exploit, or normalise harm — tend to display broader patterns:  
- Distorted relationships with **accountability** and **truth**  
- **Instrumental use** of social systems and trust mechanisms  
- A **risk-minimisation drive** that leads them to exploit technology, legal grey zones, and organisational loopholes  

The internet has become the most powerful toolset for these actors.  
Because it offers both access and anonymity, those who wish to harm will be **highly motivated** to understand, influence, and control it.  
They do not simply use the internet — they shape it, build within it, and burn it down when needed.  

This is why regulation cannot rely on assumptions of good faith.  
A **progressive legal framework** must be coupled with **conservative risk management**:  
forward-looking in scope, but cautious and restrictive in the systems that enable harm.  

Good faith is not a containment strategy.  
Believing in good faith where none exists allows harm to scale.  

This document therefore proceeds from a **low tolerance for harm**.  
It accepts that some policy discomfort for adults — economic, social, or technical — is an acceptable trade-off if it prevents the abuse of a single child.

## 🛰️ Overview  

This node traces how sexual predation against minors has recurred across societies and eras — from ancient child-marriage norms to modern scandals inside institutions.  
It exists as a **skeleton** for later expansion.  

---

## 🪢 Scope  

- **Historic baselines:** child brides, apprenticeship abuses, ritualised “acceptance” of child exploitation.  
- **Modern exposure:** 19th–21st century records, journalism, and survivor testimony.  
- **Predator behaviour:** common tactics, technological leverage, and group enabling.  
- **Governance responses:** legislation, policy cycles, and societal backlash.  
- **Risk mapping:** why these histories matter for present-day safeguarding and counter-predator design.

## 📝 Sections to Draft  

1. **Definitions & Framing** – attraction vs harm, behavioural risk logic, regulatory realism.  
2. **Historical Normalisations** – child marriage, child labour, and legal loopholes.  
3. **Documented Cases & Networks** – institutions, cults, and conspiracies (factual not conspiracist).  
4. **Patterns of Predator Behaviour** – grooming, technology, group endorsement.  
5. **Law & Policy Responses** – successes, failures, and unintended effects.  
6. **Modern Risk Profile** – why understanding history informs current safeguarding.  
7. **Online Behaviour Patterns** – how predatory actors manifest digitally, their grooming scripts, community camouflage, and exploitation of platform affordances.  
8. **Countermeasures & Future Research** – frameworks for harm reduction.

- prob also what conspiricy theorists get right and what is nonsense, qanon etc as containment, mythbusting re who is/is not and profiles in public, nature of "networking" (ie lot less scary and much more enforceable than it is), liklihood of other org crim behaviours and other forensic behaviours, and the very annoying reality of "what actually prevents harm to kids, even if it doesnt indulge adults' anger", strengthening of sg systems, history of failure of platform mods etc, and why regulating porn essentially makes CSEM even worse. how political orgs will tolerate and why they tolerate abusers, how abusers always go nazi (literally always), how totalitarianism/authoritarianism/fascism overlaps (in creation, in tolerance, and in continuing cycles of violence)
- why prison is bad if you want less child abuse; i know, i know, but the unfortunate choice is that we have less harm or we see punishment as spectacle. unfirtunately acheiving both is practically impossible. communal and individual sense of justice can be acheived in different ways, however.  

- idk man the thing is heavy, and its heavy for me personally. hang tight.

*The Unfortunate History of Predators in Organised Groups* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It scaffolds the long view of predation inside organised settings so that survivor-informed risk management can be built with historical memory intact.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
