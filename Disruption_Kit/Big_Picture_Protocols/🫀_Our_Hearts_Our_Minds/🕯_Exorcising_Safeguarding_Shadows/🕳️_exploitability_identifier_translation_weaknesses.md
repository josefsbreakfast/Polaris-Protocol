# 🕳️ Exploitability of Identifier & Translation Weaknesses  
**First created:** 2025-10-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-16  
*A practical explainer of how low-tech exploitation of identifier/translation bugs and triage classifiers can be weaponised to hide activity or silence people — and what survivors and institutions can do about it.*  

---

## 🧭 Summary
Some attacks against citizens and complainants are not sophisticated hacks but procedural exploits: deliberately submitting or manipulating identifiers and metadata so that federated systems mis-route, quarantine, duplicate, or drop records. These tactics are cheap, hard to detect, and highly effective against legacy, multi-vendor public-sector stacks.

This node explains:
- plausible attack patterns,
- why they evade audits,
- what the on-the-ground symptoms look like,
- concrete steps survivors and institutions can take to detect and remediate them.

---

## 🔧 Attack patterns (how an exploiter would do it)
- **Malformed identifiers:** submit IDs with or without leading zeros, with extra characters, or in alternate date formats to trigger parser errors downstream.  
- **Delimiter / injection tricks:** include separators or control characters that cause the transformation layer to split or shift fields.  
- **Namespace collisions:** use identifiers that fall into special/reserved ranges so systems treat them as legacy or exceptional.  
- **Shadow writes / partial syncs:** create records in one system without completing the canonical indexing step, producing “shadow” profiles.  
- **Flagging and tagging:** add or toggle flags (sensitive, safeguarding, vexatious) to divert routing and quarantine content.  
- **Classifier gaming:** repeatedly craft submissions to trigger automated triage into low-priority or siloed queues (e.g. flagged as “mental-health” or “vexatious”).  
- **Repeated one-off noise:** send many slight variants so each looks like a unique issue rather than a pattern, causing auditors to dismiss anomalies as noise.

---

## 🤷 Why this is so effective
- **No single owner** of cross-agency data pipelines — responsibility is fragmented.  
- **Transformation layers are opaque** and often outsourced; logs are minimal or poorly retained.  
- **Automated triage silences humans** — many odd submissions never reach a human reviewer.  
- **Cheap to perform** — requires operational knowledge, not advanced hacking.  
- **Patchwork fixes mask the root cause** — local teams “work around” rather than fix the shared parser, leaving the exploit intact.

---

## 🔍 Why audits miss it
- Individual SAR/FOI returns look plausible in isolation.  
- The mis-translation sits in middleware: System A's “sent” log and System B's “received” log both appear valid even when the middle step corrupted fields.  
- Audit trails rarely cross system boundaries without a forensic trace request.  
- Many audits focus on access logs and permissions, not idempotency and transformation fidelity.

---

## 👁️ Symptoms survivors will notice (practical)
- References that appear in one agency but not others.  
- Slight differences in your identifier across outputs (leading zeros, hyphens, swapped digits).  
- Submissions creating new reference numbers repeatedly.  
- Long “under review” holds with no review dates.  
- Replies missing attachments or showing truncated metadata.  
- Different staff giving conflicting explanations for the same record.

(If you have these, keep detailed logs — they are evidence.)

---

## 🛠️ What survivors can do immediately
- **Log everything**: date/time, channel, exact text, reference numbers, screenshots. Keep two copies.  
- **Submit SARs that request identifier variants** (ask for searches using alternative formats).  
- **Request processing/transformation logs** from DPOs and ask for the middleware supplier if they don’t hold them.  
- **Cross-compare SAR outputs** across agencies and highlight field divergences in a simple table.  
- **Escalate to ICO** as a potential systemic issue if two or more controllers show incompatible records.  
- **Use alternative contact paths** (MPs, survivor charities, friends’ devices) to bypass intake filters.  
- **Preserve chain-of-custody** for screenshots and emails — they’re evidence for regulators.

---

## 🧭 What institutions should do (detection & remediation)
- **Treat cross-controller mismatches as systemic**: two contradictory outputs should trigger a joint root-cause review, not a “user error” letter.  
- **Log transformation metadata**: ensure middleware records are retained and available for SAR responses.  
- **Support variant searching**: DPO processes should include searches by identifier variants (leading zeros, separators, alternate date formats).  
- **Audit triage classifiers**: sample cases routed to “low priority” queues for human review to detect gaming.  
- **Create a cross-agency taskforce** for reconciliation when pattern symptoms appear (single owner to coordinate fixes).  
- **Patch parsers not just endpoints**: fix normalization logic at the transformation layer rather than local workarounds.  
- **Publish transparency notices** explaining how identifiers are normalised and how to submit resiliently.

---

## 🕵️ Forensic trace steps (technical auditors)
1. Obtain end-to-end logs: ingest, transformation/normalisation, routing, and receive logs with timestamps.  
2. Replay the input payload against the transformation layer (test different variants).  
3. Check for idempotency failures (resubmissions creating new canonical IDs).  
4. Inspect classifier training data and rule-sets for deterministic triggers that route to quarantine.  
5. Map supplier boundaries: which vendor component holds the transformation logic and logs?

## 📝 Suggested wording — survivor SAR (copy/paste)
```
Subject: SAR — Search for identifier variants & transformation logs

Dear Data Protection Officer,

Under the Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR I request all personal data you hold about me. Please also perform explicit searches for records using the following identifier variants and return separate extracts for each:

- [Primary identifier] and variants: e.g. 0123456789 / 123456789  
- Case ID variations: with and without hyphens, spaces, or leading zeros  
- My name in truncated/alternate forms and DOB in both DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY

Please provide any middleware/transformation logs, routing metadata, or processing/audit trails that show how records with these identifiers were handled or transformed. If you rely on a third-party supplier for this processing, please identify them.

If any exemption is claimed, identify the statutory basis, the date it was applied, and the next review date.

Kind regards,
[Name, contact details]
```

## ✅ Remediation checklist for institutions
- Add variant-search to SAR procedures.  
- Retain transformation-layer logs for a minimum forensic window (e.g. 2 years).  
- Publish guidance on submitting robust identifiers.  
- Run periodic red-team tests (inject malformed identifiers to see routing behaviour).  
- Ensure a named cross-agency owner for reconciliation projects.

## ⚠️ Caveat
Not every oddity is exploitation. Many problems arise from legacy migrations, human error, or staffing problems. The goal of this node is to show plausibility and provide defensible steps for detection and remediation so that courts/regulators/auditors can see a clear path from hypothesis to evidence.
