## Snapshot
While “conservatorship” is a US term, UK mechanisms (Court of Protection, deputyships, safeguarding gateways, mental capacity assessments, DWP appointeeships) can combine to similar effect when oversight fails.

## Abuse paths
- Capacity findings recycled without fresh assessment.  
- Financial deputy + safeguarding referrals used to gatekeep contact.  
- Health data opacity + “best interests” language as cover.

## Small audit pool
- Repeat-use assessors, local authority legal teams, panel deputies, DWP appointees, ISP/platform trust & safety logs tied to family disputes.
