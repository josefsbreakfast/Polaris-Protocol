# ⚖️ Audit + Legal Framework — Exorcising Safeguarding Shadows  
**First created:** 2025-10-04  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*A technical sub-ledger translating safeguarding critique into verifiable audit and legal instruments.*

---

## Purpose
To operationalise the detection of “safeguarding shadows” through lawful audit mechanisms.  
This node equips investigators and compliance officers to trace accountability while preventing survivor silencing.  
It bridges moral critique with procedural law: how to challenge misuse of duty-of-care frameworks without triggering retaliation.

---

## Scope
Covers education, health, social-care, and digital-platform contexts where safeguarding policy overlaps with data governance or counter-extremism mandates.  
Primary legal anchors include:
- **Children Act 1989 & 2004**  
- **Care Act 2014**  
- **Equality Act 2010**  
- **Human Rights Act 1998** (Articles 8 & 10)  
- **Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR**  
- **Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (Prevent Duty)**  

---

## Audit Questions
1. Which statutory “duty” is invoked to justify data sharing or intervention?  
2. Is consent explicit, implied, or retroactively asserted?  
3. Who audits safeguarding databases and with what independence?  
4. Are complainants offered disclosure rights equal to staff?  
5. Does the institution’s DPIA identify human-rights risks or only reputational ones?

## Evidence Preservation Checklist
- Export access logs + version histories for all safeguarding files.  
- Record decision-makers, timestamps, legal bases (GDPR Art. 6/9).  
- Retain redacted + unredacted versions under separate seals.  
- Issue internal legal holds before whistleblowing disclosures.  
- Verify destruction protocols through external counsel.

## Minimum Documentation Set
| Document | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|
| Policy Matrix | Maps duties to actual authority lines. |
| Safeguarding Register | Chronology of all referrals + data flows. |
| Third-Party Access Log | Audits API or contractor entry points. |
| Incident Ledger | Captures containment events + internal responses. |
| Legal Opinion File | Records advice received, authors, and scope limits. |

## Recommended Actions
- Integrate **Shadow Index Scores** into statutory safeguarding audits.  
- Require **External Legal Observer** for Prevent-linked reviews.  
- Mandate **Data Ethics Impact Assessments** alongside DPIAs.  
- Build survivor representation into every safeguarding governance board.
