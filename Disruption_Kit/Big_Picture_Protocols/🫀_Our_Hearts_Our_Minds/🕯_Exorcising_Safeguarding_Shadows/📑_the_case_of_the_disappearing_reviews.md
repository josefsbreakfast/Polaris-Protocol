*On the quiet vanishing of CSE improvement reports from public record.*

## 🧾 Overview  
After major child sexual exploitation scandals (Rotherham, Rochdale, Newcastle, etc.), councils and safeguarding boards published Serious Case Reviews (SCRs), “lessons learned” documents, and multi-agency improvement plans. Many of these documents are now:  

- **Broken links** — once live on council websites, now returning 404 errors.  
- **De-indexed** — present in council archives but hidden from search/navigation.  
- **Dependent on third parties** — often retrievable only via watchdogs, cached PDFs, or academic repositories.  

This is not incidental: it reflects governance priorities.

## ⚖️ Why This Matters  
- **Financial vs. safeguarding reporting:** Councils routinely keep messy but legally mandated financial reports online; they cannot vanish because central auditors monitor them. Safeguarding reports, by contrast, lack a statutory repository. They can quietly disappear with little consequence.  
- **Governance churn:** Structural changes (LSCBs → Safeguarding Partnerships, council web migrations) provide cover for “losing” old reports.  
- **Instrumental visibility:** Documents were published at peak scandal to show accountability. Once outrage cooled, they became reputational liabilities, so they slid off the record.  
- **Systemic forgetting:** This erasure obstructs pattern analysis. Without public access to archives, researchers, survivors, and communities lose the ability to track whether “improvements” stuck.

## 🕳️ The Silencing Function  
1. **Crisis:** Publish report under pressure.  
2. **Deferral:** Promise “lessons learned” and “robust improvement plans.”  
3. **Amnesia:** Remove documents from easy access during governance reorganisation.  
4. **Containment:** Future scandals can be treated as isolated, not part of a repeated pattern.

## 🔍 Case Examples  
- **Rotherham Jay Report (2014):** Still available, but later council “improvement plans” harder to locate than the original.  
- **Newcastle JSCR (2018):** Survives on council website, but only via direct PDF link; buried from main navigation.  
- **Bradford cluster SCRs (2019):** Accessible only through safeguarding board archive, not through council site.  
- **Oldham (2022):** Independent review PDF still hosted, but surrounded by minimal follow-up.  

---

## 🧩 Analytical Frame  
This practice can be read as:  
- **Governance tactic:** Reporting without archiving = perform accountability without enduring accountability.  
- **Institutional hygiene:** Deleting inconvenient history keeps reputational surfaces clean.  
- **Survivor impact:** Removes evidence that institutions once admitted failures, undermining trust in ongoing promises.

*The Case of the Disappearing Reviews* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how councils and safeguarding boards allow key CSE improvement reports to vanish, treating them as reputational liabilities rather than durable governance artefacts.
