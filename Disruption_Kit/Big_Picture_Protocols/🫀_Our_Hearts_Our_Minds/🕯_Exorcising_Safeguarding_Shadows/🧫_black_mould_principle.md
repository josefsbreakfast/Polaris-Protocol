*Why cosmetic fixes in safeguarding governance are equivalent to painting over black mould.*

## 🧾 Concept  
Safeguarding failures and child exploitation scandals resemble **black mould in a rented flat**:  
- Toxic, recurring, and structurally embedded.  
- Councils and institutions often respond with **cosmetic cover-ups** (reports, apologies, “lessons learned” PDFs) rather than real remediation.  
- Survivors and the public can sense that the rot remains, no matter how serious or intimidating the assurances.  

**The Black Mould Principle:** If you only ever see surface fixes, assume the structural problem remains untreated.

## 🧩 Governance Application  

- **Black mould = exploitation and systemic safeguarding failures.**  
- **Paint = improvement plans, “lessons learned,” or glossy inquiries.**  
- **Landlord intimidation = institutional messaging:** *“Don’t worry, it’s fixed”* or *“stop asking questions.”*  
- **Tenant knowledge = survivor and public intuition:** people know cosmetic fixes don’t solve deep problems.

## 📊 KPIs vs OKRs  

### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)  
- Countable outputs: *“# of reports published,”* *“time to referral closure.”*  
- Easy to game: numbers can look good even when underlying safeguarding culture is broken.  
- Equivalent to **painting over mould**: the surface looks clean, the toxicity remains.  

### OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)  
- Define outcome-driven objectives. Example: *“Transparency of safeguarding dossiers.”*  
- Measurable key results:  
  - 100% of safeguarding reports accessible at original and archive links.  
  - Cross-verification with raw case data.  
  - Public audit of version history.  
- Equivalent to **treating mould at its source**: systemic fixes that prevent recurrence.

## 🔍 Evidence-Based Forensics  

Key questions to test for cosmetic vs structural remediation:  
1. **Statistical coherence:** Do figures in reports add up, or are they smoothed?  
2. **Transparency:** Are reports accessible at original links and in archives?  
3. **Raw data:** Can anonymised datasets, meeting minutes, and case logs be produced?  
4. **Consistency:** Do current reports match archived versions?  
5. **Governance fit:** Has central government received full files, not just executive summaries?  

---

## ⚠️ Risk if Ignored  
- **Political exploitation:** Alt-right groups weaponise the gaps when reports disappear or feel falsified.  
- **Governance decay:** Local → central non-transparency transforms safeguarding failure into structural corruption.  
- **Survivor betrayal:** Children and families know when the mould is still there; trust is further eroded.

*Black Mould Principle* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It sets out why cosmetic fixes in safeguarding are equivalent to painting over black mould, and why evidence-based audits must shift from KPIs to OKRs.
