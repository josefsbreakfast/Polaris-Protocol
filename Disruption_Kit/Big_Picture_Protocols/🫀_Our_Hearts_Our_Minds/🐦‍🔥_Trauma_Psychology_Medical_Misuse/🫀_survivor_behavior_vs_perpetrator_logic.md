# 🫀 Survivor Behaviour vs Perpetrator Logic

**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14
*Why systems that monitor victims’ behaviour fail to prevent violence and instead reproduce harm.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node addresses a core ethical inversion running through Prevent, IHRA implementation, and contemporary safeguarding culture: **the displacement of responsibility from perpetrators onto survivors**.

Rather than interrogating the structures, ideologies, and actors that produce harm, institutions increasingly scrutinise the behaviour, speech, and emotional expression of those experiencing threat. This inversion does not prevent violence. It manages discomfort.

## ✨ Key Features

* Surveillance is redirected at those seeking protection
* Harm is reframed as behavioural deviation
* Institutional anxiety replaces accountability
* Survivors are disciplined for expressing risk

---

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. The behavioural fallacy

Modern risk frameworks often assume that violence can be prevented by monitoring *signals* emitted by individuals.

This leads to a focus on:

* tone
* language
* emotional intensity
* political clarity
* perceived instability

When applied to survivors, this produces a false conclusion: that the problem lies in how harm is expressed rather than in how harm is generated.

---

### 2. Prevent as behavioural containment

Prevent exemplifies this inversion:

* attention is paid to how people talk, not who threatens them
* suspicion replaces protection
* early intervention becomes early discipline

The system tracks survivors’ *responses* to danger instead of perpetrators’ capacity for violence.

---

### 3. The cost to survivors

For those experiencing real risk:

* disclosure becomes dangerous
* emotional honesty is punished
* clarity is reframed as obsession
* silence becomes a survival strategy

The system teaches survivors that safety requires self-erasure.

---

### 4. Why perpetrators remain untouched

Focusing on survivor behaviour conveniently:

* avoids confronting extremist infrastructures
* sidesteps political accountability
* reduces legal complexity
* preserves institutional reputation

The people and ideologies producing violence remain structurally invisible.

---

### 5. Ethical consequences

This inversion produces moral injury:

* survivors internalise blame
* practitioners experience ethical distress
* institutions mistake quiet for safety

Violence is not prevented. It is redistributed.

*Survivor Behaviour vs Perpetrator Logic* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**. It reframes prevention ethics by restoring responsibility to those who generate harm rather than those who endure it.
