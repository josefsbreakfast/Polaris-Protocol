*Why behavioural-psych simplifications mislead, and how survivor symptomatology exposes the messiness of the brain.*

## ✨ Overview  

Brains are not designed. They are improvised through evolution — a process often misunderstood as purposeful.  
Evolution does not “aim” at perfection: it keeps whatever traits happen to enable survival and reproduction, even if those traits later bring illness, pain, or conflict.  

Nineteenth-century science often distorted this truth. Charles Darwin was extraordinarily intelligent, but not a saint; much of the writing around him was framed in eugenicist terms.  
Elites imagined humanity as improvable through selective breeding, declaring which traits should be “bred in” and which “bred out.”  
This was less about biology than about the politics of empire, slavery, and class: a moralising misread of what evolution actually means.  

Against that backdrop, it is crucial to remember: our brains today are still running the **same hardware and software** that have been patched and re-patched over thousands of years.  
Think of medical records layered across decades: old file systems still active, new ones bolted on, bugs never fully erased, patches that half-cancel each other out.  
This bricolage is wonderful and astonishing — but also chaotic, fragile, and stubbornly resistant to being drawn as a flowchart.  

It is also easy to forget how recent some of our categories are. Within living memory, people relied on embodied cues and chance to know the weather, or the moods of illness, or the signals of the body. Our certainty about these things is a twentieth-century arrival, not a timeless fact.

## 🧨 Forensic Example  

*The following cases show how “disorder” and “diagnosis” often reveal the patchwork nature of the brain, not linear design.*  

- Certain migraines spill into speech areas, producing **Broca’s aphasia**.  
- Not because language is “broken,” but because vascular + neurological quirks cross-fire.  
- To behavioural psych, this looks like: stressor → avoidance → behavioural deficit.  
- Reality: chemical, vascular, anatomical accident. The brain is kludged together, not a flowchart.  

And migraines themselves hint at the evolutionary patchwork.  
People who live with them often report they can predict weather shifts — especially heavy rain.  
Before the 1920s, when radio began broadcasting daily forecasts to the public, this would have been a survival advantage.  
In earlier centuries, weather prediction tools like barometers were rare outside of elites and seafarers.  
And this is not ancient history: many of us have known people whose living memory included not knowing the weather in this amount of detail.  
What our medical system calls “disorder” today may once have been a valued sensory attunement — until mass meteorology made the skill redundant.  

Another case comes from **functional MRI (fMRI)**.  
fMRI is a powerful research tool, yet it is rarely used in routine clinical practice.  
This is not because it offers no clinical insight, but because we still lack a reliable enough handle on what we are looking at.  
The interaction between neural activity, blood flow, and imaging signals remains too complex to yield clear-cut, everyday diagnostics.  
Rather than being disappointing, this is fascinating: it shows how even our most advanced maps struggle to capture the territory.

## 🚀 Flowcharts vs Territory  

Behavioural psychology deliberately pares back complexity: it asks why humans repeat behaviours, and then codes those answers into simplified loops.  
That is useful in its place — just as fMRI is useful in research, not in everyday diagnosis.  
The trouble comes when those simplifications become **reified as governance tools**.  
A neat diagram meant for teaching slides turns into a compliance algorithm or a risk assessment matrix.  

- **Teaching vs reality** → Flowcharts work as mnemonics in a classroom, but not as guides to lived neurological complexity.  
- **Governance creep** → Policy-makers mistake them for truth, embedding false cause-and-effect logics in social services, courts, and policing.  
- **Survivor consequence** → The result is misdiagnosis, “non-compliance” notes, or denial of accommodations—because reality fails to match the map.  

This tendency to mistake maps for territory shows up not only in policy but in culture.  
Behavioural simplifications escape their disciplinary home and travel widely:  

- **Psycho-Cybernetics** (Maxwell Maltz, 1960) repackaged cybernetic psychology into a self-help doctrine, teaching people to “reprogram” themselves like machines.  
- **Nudge** (Richard Thaler & Cass Sunstein, 2008) turned behavioural loops into official governance playbooks, embedding flowchart logic into law and policy.  
- **Post-Capitalist Desire** (Mark Fisher, 2020) pushes back, naming how these logics colonise desire itself and asking what forms of imagination might break beyond them.  

Taken together, they trace how behavioural psychology’s pared-down models shape not just governance, but the way people understand their own lives and futures.  

This is where the language of the **multidisciplinary team (MDT)** becomes important.  
We are reaching levels of complexity in science, medicine, and the humanities where no single discipline can reasonably hold the whole picture.  
That should not be frightening. It is a marker of how far our collective knowledge has developed.  
The fact that neuroscientists, psychologists, ethicists, and survivor communities must now turn to each other is not a weakness but a strength — proof that the map is expanding beyond any one discipline’s control, and that collaboration is now our most advanced tool.

## 🧫 Universities as Biofilms  

The same misshape shows up in institutions.  
Universities, which should act as **commons for cross-disciplinary dialogue**, often congeal into **biofilms**: protective, inward-facing colonies.  
Departments cluster around grant calls, methodologies, and status hierarchies, creating layers that resist penetration from outside.  

This becomes especially worrying when policy frameworks favour STEM subjects almost exclusively.  
I say this as someone absolutely in love with science — I would happily spend my entire life in academic science.  
But the truth is that scientists are exactly the kind of people who will clone a sheep simply because it was interesting and seemed like a good idea at the time.  
Even with ethics committees, we know in our heart of hearts that we need to be reined in and balanced by the social sciences and the humanities.  

That is what makes a great academic team: not just technical expertise, but the friction and insight of disciplines that ask different questions.  
In practice, this has meant my own crash-courses in political science, in Black history, in fields I was never trained in but had to learn from others simply to make Polaris viable.  
It has meant making mistakes, sitting down, listening, and learning from people whose lived experience is different to mine.  

When universities favour only STEM, and when they fund siloed clusters rather than cross-disciplinary groups, they don’t just create inefficiency.  
They actively undermine academic output, stripping away the checks, balances, and richness that come from disciplines talking to each other.  

This is also a national question.  
The UK’s exports are not only luxury goods but also research, development, and intellectual property.  
Brexit has already dampened relations with many European colleagues, cutting off funding streams and weakening networks.  
If Britain truly wants the scientific and technological boom so often promised, then we must rebuild the habit of working in teams — across borders and across disciplines.  
And that means something politically unfashionable but pragmatically obvious: we need to fund the humanities too.  

This is where the cliché of “Mickey Mouse degrees” collapses under its own weight.  
Humanities students contribute to the fabric of university life in ways STEM students cannot replicate.  
It is this collective life — debates, cultural work, political organising, art, history, philosophy — that ferments the conditions for real innovation.  
Strip that away, and you strip away the difficult-to-define element that makes university output more than the sum of its parts.

## 🧬 Two-Flows Model  

What works instead is a **two-flows model**: disciplines need only a **summary grasp** of each other’s field to keep conversation open.  

- **Example** → Physicists don’t need clinical radiology; radiologists don’t need raw physics. But each must know enough to sense when an assumption is shaky and call in expertise.  
- **Crossing point** → Innovation, clarity, and fairness emerge in these crossings, not from siloed totalities.  
- **For survivors** → This is the difference between being labelled “difficult” under a behavioural flowchart, and being recognised as someone living with a vascular-neurological overlap that needs medical—not disciplinary—support.  

The antidote to biofilm universities is this two-flows model.  
It is not about pretending mastery of other domains, but about cultivating enough literacy to recognise when to call in colleagues.  
That crossing, that ferment, is where the real breakthroughs begin.  

And this is where we need to build practices back into our daily lives and systems that actively **communicate across disciplines**.  
The two-flows model is only one way of picturing it, not the only way.  
Colleagues across academia and beyond have lived their own examples of what this looks like in practice.  

One striking recent case was the Palestinian encampments.  
They created spaces where an eclectic mix of disciplines, students, and communities came together around a humanitarian cause.  
In those circles I learned from people whose subjects I would never have gone searching for in a library — and yet what they taught me now feeds directly back into my own discipline.  
That kind of liberating, welcoming, cross-pollination is what makes the two-flows model come alive: not an abstract diagram, but a lived commons of learning.  

People sometimes asked me, as a Jewish person, whether it felt strange or frightening to be there.  
But the truth is that I was too busy learning about the commons, admiring Palestinian embroidery, and enjoying the food.  
It was lovely.  
It was also the only place I had to pray, and to have the very particular grief I was carrying recognised.  
That recognition came from people who were largely not Jewish, but also included other Jewish people present in solidarity.

## 🌱 Future Commons  

The lesson is not despair at complexity, but awe.  
Brains are patchworks and universities are biofilms; yet when disciplines cross and when communities gather, something astonishing happens.  

The future of knowledge cannot be drawn as a flowchart.  
It looks more like an encampment commons: food shared, grief recognised, embroidery passed hand to hand, physics students learning from poets, neuroscientists listening to historians.  
Innovation will not come from silos or from funding STEM alone. It will come from fermentation — the unruly, difficult-to-map life of disciplines and people working together.  

Academic futurism asks us to stop fearing that no one field can hold it all.  
Instead, it invites us to celebrate that truth: that only together can we hold what knowledge has become.  
This is the promise of the two-flows model, the vision of survivor testimony, and the work that lies ahead for any institution that wants to thrive.  

From the **Levellers’ Agreement of the People** in the 1640s to today’s Palestinian encampments, the commons keeps returning as England’s most radical tradition — a reminder that futurism is often rooted in very old soil.

## 📑 Addendum: Neutral Abstract  

This node explores the limits of behavioural psychology’s reliance on simplified models of human behaviour.  
Drawing on examples such as migraine-linked aphasia and the current limitations of functional MRI, it demonstrates that the human brain is less like a linear flowchart and more like an evolutionary patchwork.  
Simplifications can be useful pedagogically, but when they are reified into governance tools they risk misdiagnosis, misclassification, and systemic bias.  

The node extends this critique to institutions, noting how universities often replicate “biofilm” structures: inward-facing, siloed, and frequently skewed towards STEM at the expense of cross-disciplinary collaboration.  
It argues that the UK’s future research and innovation capacity depends on reinvesting in humanities and rebuilding cross-border academic networks disrupted by Brexit.  

As an alternative, the node advances a “two-flows model” of interdisciplinarity, in which different disciplines maintain literacy sufficient to engage and collaborate without collapsing into silos or claiming total mastery.  
The future of knowledge is framed as a commons: innovative, collaborative, and necessarily shared across disciplinary, institutional, and cultural boundaries.
