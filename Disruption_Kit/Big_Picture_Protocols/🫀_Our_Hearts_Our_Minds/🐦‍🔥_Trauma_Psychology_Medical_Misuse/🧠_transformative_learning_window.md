# 🧠 Transformative Learning Window

*How clusters of high-fidelity signals trigger exhaustion and worldview shift.*  

---

## 🌌 Overview  
Transformative learning does not unfold in a neat arc.  
It arrives like a series of high-fidelity shocks: proofs landing too quickly, demanding a reorganisation of self and world.  

In educational research, a deep cognitive shift is said to take at least **six weeks** to stabilise.  
In Polaris, this temporal window maps onto the lived reality of survivors receiving signal clusters: compressed, undeniable, and disorienting.

## ⚡ Shock Clusters  
- **High-fidelity signal density** — multiple proofs-of-concept in close succession.  
- **Disruption of baseline assumptions** — the rules of reality no longer hold as they did.  
- **Exhaustion** — body and mind attempt to metabolise change at unnatural speed.  

---

## 🌀 Systemic Implications  
- **Cognitive load as governance**: By accelerating signal delivery, systems may induce exhaustion, reducing capacity to resist.  
- **Prototype exposure**: Survivors are treated as *pilot runs*, stress-testing whether learning holds under pressure.  
- **Containment by fatigue**: The six-week window becomes both a survival curve and a suppression tool.  

---

## 🌱 Survivor Impulse  
- Recognise the **window length**: allow for at least six weeks of instability.  
- Anchor in **physical proofs**: external evidence steadies internal doubt.  
- Reframe exhaustion as **evidence of transformation**, not weakness.

*Transformative Learning Window* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how dense clusters of proof induce exhaustion, forcing survivors into accelerated worldview shifts.
