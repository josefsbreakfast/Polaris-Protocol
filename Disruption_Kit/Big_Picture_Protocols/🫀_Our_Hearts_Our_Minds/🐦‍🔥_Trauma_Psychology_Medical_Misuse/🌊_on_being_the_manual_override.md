*The human who notices when the system starts looping.*
<!--Personally I think "Manual Override" works nicely as a blog name, but I was into 90s indie bands, so..-->

## 🧭 Orientation  
Every automated architecture needs one thing it cannot design for:  
a human who asks *“Why is everything jammed for this person?”*  
That moment of recognition is the system’s conscience surfacing.

---

## 💡 Principles  

- **Visibility as power:** noticing the pattern is the rarest diagnostic tool.  
- **Pattern-breaking:** the manual override isn’t rebellion; it’s system maintenance through empathy.  
- **Friction as feedback:** each refusal, delay, or “wait, this seems wrong” restores balance that code alone cannot provide.  
- **Human redundancy:** in automation design, redundancy equals resilience.

## 🧭 Reflection  
To be the manual override is to stand at the fault line between precision and care.  
You slow the flow not out of sabotage but out of stewardship.

## 🏮 Footer  
Every system eventually meets the person it cannot absorb.  
That person is not an error; they are the safety mechanism.
