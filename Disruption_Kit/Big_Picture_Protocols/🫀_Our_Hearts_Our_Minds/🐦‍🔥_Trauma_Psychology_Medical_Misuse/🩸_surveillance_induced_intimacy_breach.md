# 🩸 Surveillance-Induced Intimacy Breach  
**First created:** 2025-10-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*Working note while seeking language for sexualised and psychosexual violation through surveillance.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
This node holds an unresolved question:  
how to describe the form of trauma where surveillance sexualises and objectifies the body,  
while simultaneously making intimacy feel unsafe.  

It parallels child sexual abuse recovery in that the body must again be reclaimed as one’s own,  
but the site of violence here is psychological, spatial, and perceptual —  
produced through enforced visibility, monitoring, and manipulation of privacy.

## 🩹 Current Working Definition  
> **A trauma of enforced visibility and perceived sexual access through surveillance mechanisms**,  
> where the survivor’s body becomes *digitally public yet personally uninhabitable.*

---

## 📚 Adjacent Concepts (Imperfect Parallels)  
- **Surveillance sexualisation** — feminist surveillance studies: eroticisation of the gaze as control.  
- **Technosexual violence** — digital sexual harassment or image-based abuse.  
- **Psychological rape / psychosexual occupation** — trauma theory: coercive invasion without physical contact.  
- **Data-bodied violation / digital bodily autonomy breach** — legal-tech framing of body–data split.

Each overlaps but none wholly capture the survivor experience when surveillance itself enacts sexualisation.

---

## 🧩 Next Steps  
- Collect survivor terminology or creative expressions describing this feeling.  
- Review feminist tech-surveillance literature for emerging terms.  
- Draft potential naming cluster once language stabilises.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🩸 Surveillance-Induced Intimacy Breach* is a living searchlight node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records the gap where language for this form of violation is still forming,  
so future survivors need not name it alone.
