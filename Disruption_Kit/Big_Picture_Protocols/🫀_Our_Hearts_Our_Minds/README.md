# 🫀 Our Hearts Our Minds  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-17  
*Cluster on how care, harm, and belief are administered through bodies and minds.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
*Our Hearts Our Minds* traces the moral, medical, and bureaucratic infrastructures that govern the intimate terrain of being human.  
It follows how institutions translate **pain into paperwork**, **belief into policy**, and **witness into reform** — and how survivors reclaim those translations.  

The cluster spans five intersecting families of thought: body politics, trauma, witnessing, safeguarding, and humane governance.  
Each folder builds on the last: from embodied rights to trauma recovery, from testimony to reform, and from ethics back to design.  

**Purpose:** to make visible the administrative theology of care — the point where compassion becomes compliance — and to re-anchor it in dignity, reciprocity, and memory.

*🫀 Our Hearts Our Minds* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It integrates ethics, trauma, and embodiment research into a coherent framework for humane governance — showing how systems of care can either heal or repeat harm.
