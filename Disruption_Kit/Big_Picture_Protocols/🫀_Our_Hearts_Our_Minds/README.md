# 🫀 Our Hearts Our Minds  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-18  
*How care, harm, and belief are administered through bodies and minds — and how they can be reclaimed.*  

---

## ✨ Scope  
*Our Hearts Our Minds* studies how compassion becomes bureaucracy and how survivors re‑humanise what institutions have mechanised.  
It follows the translation chain between pain and paperwork, belief and policy, witness and reform — revealing how each link shapes what society calls “care.”  

This cluster is not just about suffering; it is about **repair**.  
It maps the places where compassion collapses into compliance, and how dignity, reciprocity, and memory can re‑anchor humane governance.  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
The cluster spans five intersecting families of thought: body politics, trauma, witnessing, safeguarding, and ethics.  
Each folder builds on the last — from embodied rights to trauma recovery, from testimony to reform, and from ethics back to design.  

- **🐝 Body Politic** — disability politics, embodiment, access, and rights.  
- **🐦‍🔥 Trauma Psychology & Medical Misuse** — psychological weaponisation and recovery pathways.  
- **👁️‍🗨️ Witness Historical Casefiles** — testimony, timelines, and evidential repair.  
- **🕯 Exorcising Safeguarding Shadows** — failures of protection and institutional audits.  
- **🌱 Human Principles** — normative ethics, dignity, and survivor‑authorship foundations.  

Care, harm, and reform are not opposites here — they are phases of the same cycle.

## 💬 Closing Reflection  

To care is to remember.  
To remember is to resist amnesia disguised as mercy.  
Every act of witness re‑teaches a system how to feel.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🫀 Our Hearts Our Minds* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It integrates ethics, trauma, and embodiment research into a coherent framework for humane governance — showing how systems of care can either heal or repeat harm.
