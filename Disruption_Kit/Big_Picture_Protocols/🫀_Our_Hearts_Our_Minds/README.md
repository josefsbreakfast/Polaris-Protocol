## Summary

This cluster examines how care, harm, and belief are administered through bodies and minds.  
It includes work on disability politik, trauma, witnessing, safeguarding, and the ethical principles that hold humane governance together.

Disability and embodiment politics, trauma psychology, witness testimony, safeguarding audits, and survivor-ethics foundations.

Survivors, clinicians, researchers, ethicists, policy designers, access advocates, and journalists.

**How to use**  
Begin with a witness or trauma node → cross-reference to safeguarding or human-principles materials → use *Body Politic* to map structural ableism and reform leverage.
