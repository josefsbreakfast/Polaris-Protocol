*National defence exists to protect the whole population, not to privilege the powerful.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node sets out a foundational principle of democratic defence:

**Defence is a public good.**

It exists to protect:
- civilians and service members,
- children and elders,
- whistleblowers and witnesses,
- minorities and majorities alike.

Defence is not a private asset, a reputational shield, or a political bargaining chip.

It is for **all of us**.

## 🧭 What defence means in practice

In real terms, defence means:

- protection of life and bodily integrity  
- safeguarding of children and vulnerable people  
- lawful national security, bounded by necessity and proportionality  
- truth, accountability, and democratic oversight  
- care for those injured in service  
- repair when the state causes harm  

Anything less is not defence.  
It is **selective protection**.

---

## 🧿 What defence is not

Defence is not:

- reputation management for elites  
- silence imposed for political convenience  
- secrecy used to avoid embarrassment  
- containment of individuals for narrative control  
- sacrifice of the few to preserve comfort of the powerful  

When defence institutions are used this way, defence itself is weakened.

## 🛑 The danger of exclusionary defence

When defence quietly shifts from “everyone” to “some people”:

- trust collapses,
- service members disengage,
- civilians feel unprotected,
- and adversaries observe weakness.

A system that does not defend its own people cannot credibly defend a nation.

---

## 🧠 Defence, legitimacy, and consent

Defence institutions derive legitimacy from public consent.

That consent depends on the belief that:
- defence serves the population as a whole,
- truth is not selectively suppressed,
- and harm is acknowledged and repaired.

Without legitimacy, defence becomes coercive rather than protective.

---

## ⚖️ Law as a floor, not a ceiling

Legal authority enables defence.  
It does not exhaust its obligations.

Compliance with secrecy law does not excuse:
- disproportionate harm,
- indefinite silence,
- or abandonment of those harmed by state action.

Defence worthy of the name exceeds minimum legality.

---

## 🛠️ What defending “all of us” requires

Defence that serves everyone requires:

- transparency wherever security permits  
- refusal to launder reputations through secrecy  
- safeguarding that outranks political discomfort  
- care and compensation for veterans without attrition  
- mechanisms for repair when systems fail  

These are not optional values.  
They are **operational necessities**.

---

## 🧠 Why this principle matters now

When defence is narrowed to protect:
- institutions over people,
- careers over children,
- silence over truth,

the harm does not stay contained.

It spreads — across generations, across communities, across trust itself.

Defence that excludes is defence that decays.
