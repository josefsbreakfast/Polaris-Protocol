*Queer theory as everyday emotional and structural competence.*

## 🛰️ Orientation
Queer theory is often misrepresented as academic identity discourse, but its deepest contributions are practical: learning how to relate across difference, negotiate care, manage power, and recognise fluidity in human needs. These are the same skills that sustain marriages, friendships, families, and healthy communities.

This node frames queer theory as a toolkit for relational hygiene.

## ✨ Key Features
- Queer theory as applied relational ethics.  
- Tools for boundary setting, power awareness, and negotiated intimacy.  
- Universally applicable to all partnership forms.  
- Integral to Polaris’ dual-register survivor testimony.

## 🧿 Analysis

### 💬 Relational Skills, Not Identity Doctrine
Queer theory teaches how to inhabit relationship without collapsing difference into threat. It offers vocabulary for naming needs, negotiating boundaries, and addressing imbalance.

### 👪 Universal Application
Straight couples, poly families, co‑parents, and long-term friendships all rely on the same capacities:
- emotional elasticity  
- negotiated consent  
- adaptive communication  
- shared authorship of the relationship  

These are queer skills because they resist rigid scripts.

### 🔧 Polaris Mapping
Polaris’ dual-register system—undertone + forensic clarity—mirrors queer epistemology: truth is not singular, neutrality is insufficient, and multiple registers of meaning must coexist.
