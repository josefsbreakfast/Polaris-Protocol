# 🪞 On Human Impulse  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-15  
*Principle node distinguishing natural human reactions from their weaponisation by violent systems.*

## 🌱 Principle  

**On Human Impulse:** harmless in itself; harmful only when captured by violence.  

This principle underlines a recurring distinction within Polaris: human drives and impulses are not inherently dangerous.  
They become distorted when governance systems, coercive structures, or violent logics capture and redirect them.

## ✨ Context  

Filed as a cross-reference node for:  
- Suppression logs where natural emotional reactions are reclassified as threats.  
- Taxonomy work on containment forks and behavioural overrides.  
- Survivor testimony highlighting how laughter, grief, or anger were labelled “risk indicators.”  

Human impulse, in this reading, is not a flaw but a signal.  
Its suppression or criminalisation is itself an act of violence.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🧿 🛰️ 🌱 — This node sits in the grounding register.  

- **A Spell of Good Things** (Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀, 2023) — novel of family, love, and survival under systemic violence.  
  *Shows how natural impulses for care and connection are strained, but never erased, by political and economic brutality.*  

- **Terraform: Building a Better World** (Propaganda, 2021) — essays and reflections on justice, imagination, and faith.  
  *Frames human impulse as a resource for re-creating systems that honour dignity rather than contain it.*  

- **Humankind: A Hopeful History** (Rutger Bregman, 2020) — nonfiction counter-argument to cynicism.  
  *Affirms the baseline of human cooperation and goodness, resisting system logics that portray impulse as inherently selfish or violent.*

## 🏮 Footer  

*On Human Impulse* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a principle of resistance: that natural human reactions remain sovereign, and only their capture by violent systems constitutes harm.
