# 🫀 Eating Disorder Comparisons To Hunger Strikes  
**First created:** 2025-12-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-03  
*Why “choice” is a dangerous framing — without equating illness and protest.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node explicitly **does not equate eating disorders with hunger strikes**.  
It examines instead how **the same moral error** — framing starvation as “choice” — produces harm in both contexts.

The comparison is ethical, not diagnostic.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Clear boundary between illness and protest  
- Shared harm of “they could just eat” rhetoric  
- Selective compassion as social failure  
- Retrospective praise after preventable harm  

---

## 🚫 Not The Same Thing  
- Eating disorders are mental health conditions.  
- Hunger strikes are political acts under coercion.  

They differ in cause, intent, and treatment.

But society repeatedly makes the **same mistake** in responding to both.

---

## 🗣️ The “Choice” Fallacy  
In eating disorder care, it is now accepted that:
- “they could just eat” is harmful,
- shame delays recovery,
- mockery increases risk.

That knowledge disappears when starvation becomes politically inconvenient.

This is selective ethics.

## 👑 Princess Diana As Diagnostic Case  
Princess Diana:
- was open about her eating disorder,
- was hounded by the press while alive,
- helped open public mental health discourse,
- and was only widely praised after death.

The pattern repeats:
- cruelty in real time,
- sanctification after the fact.

---

## 🪞 Why This Comparison Matters  
If starvation is only treated as an emergency when the sufferer is sympathetic, then:
- ethics are conditional,
- safeguarding is politicised,
- and harm is predictable.

Consistency is the test of compassion.
