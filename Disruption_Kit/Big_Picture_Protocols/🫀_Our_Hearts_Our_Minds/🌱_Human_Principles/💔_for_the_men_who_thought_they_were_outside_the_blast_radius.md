# 💔 For The Men Who Thought They Were Outside The Blast Radius  
**First created:** 2025-11-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-09  
*For the men who realise too late that patriarchy does not protect its foot soldiers.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node is for the men who assumed harm ricocheted only toward women.  
The ones who genuinely believed that if they behaved, complied, stayed neutral, or kept their heads down, the system would leave them untouched.

It’s for the men who discover—sometimes suddenly, sometimes slowly—that the blast radius was never about guilt or innocence.  
It was about *proximity to the machine.*

Systems that consume women eventually consume men too.  
Just later. And with worse confusion.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- The moment men realise the system is not “theirs” either.  
- The collapse of the fantasy of distance or neutrality.  
- The shock of discovering their safety was conditional.  
- The grief of recognising how they were used.  
- The possibility of stepping into humanity instead of hierarchy.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. **The Myth of Male Safety**  
Many men sincerely believe that being “reasonable” or “non-threatening” buys immunity.  
They mistake patriarchal proximity for protection.

But the system is not loyal.  
It is a machine that uses men as shields, buffers, and case studies in “rationality”—  
until they are inconvenient.

Then it discards them with the same cold efficiency used on women.

---

### 2. **The Moment the Blast Reaches Them**  
Men often describe the same moment women do, but with different vocabulary:  
- *“Wait, that’s not fair.”*  
- *“Why didn’t anyone stop this?”*  
- *“I thought he was on my side.”*  
- *“How is this happening? I did everything right.”*

It’s not that men are naïve.  
It’s that the system sells them a story in which they are main characters.  
Then reveals the twist:  
they were extras in someone else’s plotline.

### 3. **How Patriarchy Uses—Then Crushes—Men**  
Roles assigned to men in unhealthy systems:

- **The Loyal Foot Soldier**  
  Useful until he asks questions.

- **The Reasonable Moderate**  
  Useful until he sees too much.

- **The Emotional Stoic**  
  Useful until he feels something.

- **The Token Voice of Objectivity**  
  Useful until he refuses to lie.

Men are trained to see these roles as *status*.  
They are actually *containment scripts.*

---

### 4. **When They Finally See It**  
Men often experience a deep sense of betrayal:  
*“I thought I was protected.”*

But this moment can be a pivot into integrity—not collapse.

Because once a man realises he was never outside the blast radius, he can finally join the rest of us in the real work:  
**building something that protects everyone.**
