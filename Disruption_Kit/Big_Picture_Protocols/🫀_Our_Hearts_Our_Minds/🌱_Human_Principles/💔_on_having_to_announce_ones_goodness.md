*When risk systems mistake depth for danger, survival becomes self-narration.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Every era invents its own customs of confession.  
Ours requires that we declare our harmlessness before we’re allowed to speak.  
To exist within the modern risk apparatus is to fill out a perpetual moral form — a digital customs card of the soul.  
The more layered the person, the more suspicious the record.

## 💬 Reflection  

It is a strange heartbreak to have to announce your goodness.  
To stand in front of a faceless evaluator and say, *I am not what you fear; I am only thinking*.  

Complexity becomes an anomaly; sincerity becomes a flagged variable.  
Algorithms have no room for hesitation or irony — they only know how to sort, not to understand.  
So we simplify ourselves into compliance, rewriting our inner weather into acceptable data.  

Somewhere along the line, *being good* became less about what we do and more about how easily we can be audited.  

But goodness was never meant to be a performance.  
It was meant to be a quiet thing — an action that asked for no receipt.  
When the world insists we prove it, the truest kindness becomes resistance: to remain human even when explanation is demanded.
