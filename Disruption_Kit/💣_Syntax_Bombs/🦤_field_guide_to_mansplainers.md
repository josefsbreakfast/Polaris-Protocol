# 🦤 Field Guide to Mansplainers  

**Polaris Protocol Node:** `Syntax_Bombs/`  
**Threat Level:** Loud but fragile  
**Classification:** Comic wildlife, not credible opponents  

---

## General Characteristics  
- **Plumage:** Spreadsheet screenshots, YouTube links, LinkedIn bios heavy on “CEO of Myself Consulting.”  
- **Call:** Begins with *“Respectfully…”* then proceeds to be deeply disrespectful.  
- **Habitat:** Comment sections, Substack replies, and late-night LinkedIn threads where no actual experts linger.

## Subspecies  

### 1. Carbon Math Guy (*Excelus volcanicus*)  
- **Claim:** “Volcanoes emit more CO₂ than humans.”  
- **Reality:** Humans emit ~100× more.  
- **Note:** Cannot distinguish an eruption from an economy.  

### 2. Mask-Hole Truther (*Microbe misinterpretatus*)  
- **Claim:** “The virus is smaller than the mask holes, so masks don’t work.”  
- **Reality:** Filtration ≠ chain-link fence.  
- **Behaviour:** Ends with “do your own research.”  

### 3. Quantum Mansplainer (*Schrödinger’s borealis*)  
- **Claim:** “It’s all probability waves, so free will is fake, babe.”  
- **Reality:** Half-remembered analogy ≠ physics.  
- **Warning:** Often misquotes Heisenberg in dating apps.  

### 4. Learn-to-Code Prophet (*Automatus redundantia*)  
- **Claim:** “The future is coding, bro.”  
- **Reality:** Coders now being automated out by AI.  
- **Callsign:** Seen haunting bootcamps and layoffs in equal measure.  

### 5. Evolution Denier (*Banana designatus*)  
- **Claim:** “A monkey never turned into a man.”  
- **Reality:** Humans *are* primates.  
- **Observation:** Still believes bananas prove God.

## Behavioural Notes  
- When challenged, increases volume, decreases evidence.  
- Draws credibility not from sources but from tone.  
- Cannot survive in the wild if ignored; thrives on engagement.

## Containment Protocol  
- **Do not debate.** Catalogue instead.  
- **Deploy satire.** Treat as zoological exhibit.  
- **Redirect attention.** Make their “big numbers” look small in the ecosystem of actual science.

## Emoji Taxonomy Table  

| Domain                | Subtype                     | Emoji | Classic Claim | Obvious Challenge |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Climate & Energy**  | Carbon math guys            | 🌍    | “Volcanoes emit more CO₂ than humans.” | Humans emit ~100× more CO₂ than all volcanoes combined. |
|                       | Nuclear bros                | 🔋    | “Energy is purely technical, not political.” | Energy policy is always political: subsidies, waste storage, land rights. |
|                       | Oil apologists              | ⛽    | “Fossil fuels lifted us out of poverty.” | Fossil fuels caused the climate crisis and harm poorest first. |
| **COVID & Public Health** | Mask-truthers            | 😷    | “The virus is smaller than mask holes.” | Filtration works by electrostatic + layered trapping, not hole size. |
|                       | Vaccine explainers          | 💉    | “I read a preprint once — I’m basically an immunologist.” | Vaccines are tested on millions; one preprint ≠ global consensus. |
|                       | Mortality minimisers        | 📉    | “It’s just the flu.” | COVID killed millions more than flu in comparable timeframes. |
| **Space & Physics**   | Flat-earthers / geocentrists| 🌌    | “Earth is the centre of the universe.” | Satellite navigation literally wouldn’t work if Earth were flat. |
|                       | Moon landing skeptics       | 🚀    | “Kubrick filmed it in a studio.” | Moon rocks independently verified by multiple countries. |
|                       | Quantum mansplainers        | ⚛️    | “Schrödinger proves free will doesn’t exist.” | Schrödinger’s cat was a *joke* to show limits of the analogy. |
| **Tech & AI**         | AI denialists               | 🤖    | “It’s just statistics, nothing to worry about.” | Statistics at scale reshape labour, politics, and identity. |
|                       | Learn-to-code prophets      | 🖥️    | “Coding is the one safe future skill.” | AI is already automating coding itself. |
|                       | Privacy contrarians         | 📱    | “If you’ve got nothing to hide, why worry?” | Privacy protects democracy; surveillance harms everyone. |
| **Gender & Biology**  | Evolution deniers           | 🧬    | “A monkey never turned into a man.” | Humans *are* primates; evolution is well-documented. |
|                       | Women-in-STEM hecklers      | 👩‍🔬  | “Well, actually…” under Nobel-winning scientists. | Patronising ≠ evidence; women literally win Nobels here. |
