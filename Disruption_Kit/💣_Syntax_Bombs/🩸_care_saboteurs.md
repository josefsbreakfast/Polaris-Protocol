## 🧠 Usage Notes

- **Forensic layer**:  
  - Deploy during safeguarding reviews, health assessments, or legal proceedings where “care” is used as cover.  
  - Pair with contemporaneous notes or FOIA/SAR requests to expose doublespeak.  
  - Do not dilute phrasing — clarity is the sabotage.  

- **Poetic sabotage layer**:  
  - Speak phrases aloud in clinical or bureaucratic settings to fracture the illusion of benevolence.  
  - Document every time “care” was weaponised against you — let their words incriminate themselves.

## 🕯 Function

- Breaks the illusion that containment = compassion.  
- Forces institutions to confront their own contradictions.
