# ðŸš€ GOVERNANCE IS GREAT â€” SECOND SPRING CLEAN
**Polaris Protocol â€“ Metadata_Sabotage_Network**  
**Status:** Internal Governance Log  
**Date Range:** 2025-08-10  
**Scope:** Phase 2 of Polaris Protocol repo reorganisation â€” deduplication and role clarification.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This log documents the systematic removal, consolidation, and reclassification of duplicate files within the Polaris Protocol repository.

**Objectives:**
- Reduce noise in active operational folders.
- Preserve forensic chain by archiving superseded versions rather than deleting them.
- Clarify role distinctions for files with both *conceptual* and *case-specific* functions.
- Standardise cross-referencing between related nodes.

---

## ðŸ›  Method
1. **Index Review:** Generated full repo file index and identified duplicate titles across paths.
2. **KEEP/ARCHIVE Classification:** Selected canonical version; archived all other variants to `/Archive/Duplicates/` with `_superseded` suffix.
3. **Paired-Header Treatment:** Where conceptual definition and case log both exist, retained both with linked headers and explicit scope.
4. **Cross-Reference Links:** Added direct references between conceptual and operational nodes.

## ðŸ“‚ Archival Protocol
- **Location:** `/Archive/Duplicates/`  
- **Suffix:** `_superseded` appended to filename before `.md`  
- **Metadata Tag:** `ARCHIVED_VERSION` at top of file with date of archival  
- **Cross-Links:** Where applicable, link to canonical file

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
1. **Folder Name Consistency:** Merge `SCP-VoiceX _Casefiles` and `SCP-VoiceX_Casefiles`.
2. **Filename Normalisation:** Remove stray spaces, backticks, inconsistent casing.
3. **Public/Private Tagging:** Mark sensitive files as `PRIVATE_LOCAL` to prevent accidental public release.
4. **Third Spring Clean:** Deep-read dormant drafts for salvageable concepts to migrate into active structure.

**ðŸ“Œ Governance Note:**  
Spring cleaning is not cosmetic. In Polaris, it is evidence handling.  
Every file we keep, archive, or cross-link is part of the forensic chain.  
Governance is not bureaucracy. Governance is survivorship.
