*Clauses to break recursive containment patterns and throttling cycles*  

---

## 📜 Clauses  

- **Collapse on Recursion**  
  If the system loops back to silence, the loop itself is evidence of containment.  

- **Exit Condition = Survivor Refusal**  
  A single act of refusal is enough to break an enforced loop.  

- **Throttle Is Proof**  
  When visibility or response is delayed, the delay itself is admissible evidence.  

- **Endless Wait ≠ Neutrality**  
  Delay is not impartial; it is a tactic.  

---

## 🛠 Tactical Use  

- Use during algorithmic throttling (delayed impressions, shadow metrics).  
- Insert into metadata sabotage logs as counters to endless recursion.  
- Document to break “forced patience” containment scripts.

*Loop Interruption* is an anti-containment clause of the Polaris Protocol.  

Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.
