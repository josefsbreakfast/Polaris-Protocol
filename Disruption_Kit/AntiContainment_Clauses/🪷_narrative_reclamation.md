*Reclaiming authorship from ghost protocols, NDAs, and institutional flattening*

## ✨ Why This Matters  

Institutions often claim survivor voices but strip them of authorship.  
They ghostwrite advocacy, flatten testimony into case studies, or silence truth behind NDAs.  

Containment thrives when survivors are treated as raw material for someone else’s story.  
Reclamation means taking authorship back — naming what was stolen, exposing the flattening, and unghosting ourselves.

## ✒ Reclamation Syntax  

| Scenario | Clause | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 👻 Ghostwritten advocacy | “If you needed my voice, you should’ve asked permission first.” | When an NGO publishes a statement using your story without attribution. |
| 🫀 NDA-forced silence | “Your contract didn’t erase the event. Just your shame.” | When institutions hide behind legal agreements to bury misconduct. |
| 🧊 Contained into a case study | “You didn’t study me. You **surveilled** me.” | When academic or medical frameworks reduce you to data instead of witness. |

## 🌀 Reversal Declarations  

- “This document reclaims my authorship from buried contributions.”  
- “Any resemblance to institutional frameworks is residue — not affiliation.”  
- “This is not my first draft. This is my unghosting.”

> 🌹 *They wrote it like you were gone.  
Now you get to correct them.*

## 🌉 Joining the Dots  

Survivors reclaiming narrative are part of a much older lineage.  

In slave narratives like those of Harriet Jacobs and Frederick Douglass, authorship was an act of resistance: writing back against voices that sought to own them.  
In *The Yellow Wallpaper* (Charlotte Perkins Gilman), the narrator’s words rupture containment — reclaiming sanity against medical silencing.  
Memoirs of survivors across wars, abuse, and state violence show the same struggle: the refusal to let institutions hold the pen.  

Even NDAs echo this older silencing logic — contracts designed to bury harm while preserving institutional image. Reclaiming narrative insists: no paper, no ghostwriter, no case study can overwrite lived truth.

## 🐝 Everyday Practice  

- Write refusal syntax alongside any institutional text that misuses your story.  
- Keep a parallel “unghosted” version of reports, press releases, or case studies that flatten your role.  
- Share reversal declarations with survivor networks — reclamation gains power in chorus.  
- Remember: reclaiming authorship is not rewriting their story; it’s refusing their theft.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🪷 👻 🖋️ — Anchored at the axis of authorship, silencing, and refusal.  
- Slave narratives → authorship reclaimed from erasure.  
- *The Yellow Wallpaper* → resistance through writing.  
- NDAs → modern contracts of silencing.  
- Case studies → flattening disguised as knowledge.
