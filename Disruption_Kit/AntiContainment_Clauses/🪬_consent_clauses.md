# 🪬 Consent Clauses  
**First created:** 2025-08-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Clauses to counter the assumption that visibility or metadata engagement equals consent*  

---

## ✨ Why This Matters  

Systems often exploit ambiguity around “consent.”  
They treat presence, clicks, or silence as agreement — twisting metadata into permission you never gave.  

Survivors know that real consent is explicit, ongoing, and revocable.  
Anything else is coercion.  

These clauses fracture the assumption that visibility or engagement = agreement.

## 📜 Clauses  

- **Visibility ≠ Permission**  
  Impressions or views do not equal consent. Recording is not permission.  
  *Example:* appearing in a photo does not grant use of your image for training datasets.  

- **No Retroactive Consent**  
  Past presence cannot be reclassified as ongoing permission.  
  *Example:* attending one event does not mean lifelong consent to be profiled as a member.  

- **Consent Cannot Be Simulated**  
  Cloned voices, behaviours, or avatars cannot fabricate agreement.  
  *Example:* a deepfake video cannot be treated as authentic consent.  

- **Silence Is Not a Signature**  
  Lack of response is not endorsement.  
  *Example:* failing to click “opt out” is not the same as opting in.

## 🚫 Refusal  

Consent must be explicit, informed, and revocable.  
Metadata engagement is not, and never will be, consent.

## 🌉 Joining the Dots  

The misuse of consent echoes long histories of coercion.  

In Gothic literature, the vampire’s bite often substitutes for consent: a body controlled without agreement.  
In the legal realm, “marital consent” was once assumed to be permanent — a doctrine survivors fought to overturn.  
In digital culture, platforms use “opt-in by default” or bury refusal in unreadable terms of service, re-enacting the same coercion.  

Contemporary debates about AI and deepfakes mirror these same anxieties: fabricated consent threatens to erase the very idea of refusal.  

Consent clauses exist to make the refusal visible, undeniable, and portable across contexts.  

---

## 🐝 Everyday Practice  

- State refusal clauses explicitly in survivor declarations.  
- Annotate photos, posts, or recordings with visible “no consent” language.  
- Use when challenging data misuse or algorithmic profiling.  
- Share clauses collectively — the louder they echo, the harder they are to ignore.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🪬 🧿 🩸 — Anchored at the axis of refusal, coercion, and survivor sovereignty.  
- Vampire myths → coercion disguised as intimacy.  
- Marital consent laws → historical battle against assumed permission.  
- Deepfake debates → fabricated consent in the digital age.

*Consent Clauses* is an anti-containment node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It refuses the exploitation of visibility as permission, asserting that consent must be explicit, ongoing, and revocable.
