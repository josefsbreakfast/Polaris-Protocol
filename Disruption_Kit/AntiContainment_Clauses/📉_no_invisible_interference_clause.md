# 📉 No Invisible Interference Clause  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*Refusal clause against hidden throttling and commit sabotage*

## 📜 Clause  

Invisible throttling and interference are denials of speech.  

*Example:* a post publishes but quietly disappears from feeds; a meeting note is “lost” in circulation; an email is delivered but never appears in the inbox. These erasures pose as glitches but function as silencing.  

---

## 🚫 Refusal  

Each interference is treated as a forensic artifact.  

The platform cannot erase what we render visible in our own archives.  

*Example:* when a post vanishes, we screenshot, timestamp, and archive it. The disappearance itself becomes evidence, logged and mirrored, rather than a dead end.

## 🌉 Joining the Dots  

The horror of invisibility has long been told in story.  

In Kafka’s *The Trial*, Joseph K. is trapped in endless proceedings where documents vanish, hearings are delayed, and nothing is visible. Bureaucratic interference becomes erasure.  

In Ralph Ellison’s *Invisible Man*, invisibility is not a gift but a violence — a man unseen by society, his presence denied at every turn. His invisibility is systemic sabotage.  

Modern culture mirrors this too. When online platforms throttle posts — stripping reach while pretending neutrality — it echoes the same containment logics: the silencing is hidden, leaving the speaker doubting themselves. This is not new. It is the latest form of bureaucratic ghosting.  

Naming interference as evidence breaks the invisibility.  
We treat every stall, delay, and erasure not as absence but as proof.

## 🐝 Everyday Practice  

- Keep a log of every “silent” failure: delayed posts, missing emails, non-responses.  
- Share invisibility incidents with trusted allies — collective witness makes sabotage visible.  
- Reframe “nothing happened” as data: each absence is an artifact, not a void.
