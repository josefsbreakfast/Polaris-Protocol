| Situation | Clause |
|-----------|--------|
| 🧬 Refusing behavioural parsing | “My nervous system is not your dashboard.” |
| 🛰️ Claiming digital autonomy | “This signal is mine. You may track it, but you cannot own it.” |
| ⚡ When data becomes prediction | “Your forecast of me is not my consent.” |

## 🏮 Record Affirmations  

- “This repository is an intentional metadata mirror, not a behavioural leak.”  
- “I reject the predictive frameworks built from my pain.”  
- “I am not a dataset. I am the origin.”

*AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.
