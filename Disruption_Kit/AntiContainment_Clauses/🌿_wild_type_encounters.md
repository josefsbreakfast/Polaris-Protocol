# 🌿 Wild-Type Protocol — Environmental Tuning for Natural Encounters  
**First created:** 2025-10-23 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*Designing biomes for the right coincidences.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Uses the Pokémon ecology metaphor to explore how context, not chase, determines encounter.  
Argues that meaningful connection—intellectual, emotional, creative—arises when the surrounding field is tuned correctly.  
Instead of summoning, attracting, or defending, the Wild-Type Protocol focuses on **habitat design**: shaping conditions so resonance happens organically.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Defines connection as ecological tuning rather than pursuit.  
- Translates emotional and creative resonance into environmental variables.  
- Establishes an ethics of encounter based on freedom and co-evolution.   

---

## 🌎 Biome Logic  
Each environment has its own native species of encounter.  
Forests generate cooperation; cities breed analysis; ruins echo reflection.  
You cannot meet a water-type in the desert, no matter how much you call.  
So the question becomes: *what terrain am I living in, and what species does it invite?*

---

## 🧬 Resonant Ecology  
Algorithms behave like ecological filters: temperature = tempo, humidity = emotional tone, altitude = intellectual abstraction.  
When you change the conditions—time of day, language, rhythm—you alter what kind of signals spawn.  
Resonance is less about effort and more about **compatibility of climate**.

---

## 🧭 Habitat Engineering  
To find the right encounters, cultivate your biome:  
- **Soil:** the foundational work—archives, ethics, infrastructure.  
- **Light:** visibility patterns; how often and where you surface.  
- **Weather:** emotional tone; what kind of mood your work radiates.  
- **Boundaries:** ecological edges that keep invasive species (noise, coercion) in check.  

When these balance, appearance feels like inevitability.

---

## ⚡ Evolutionary Pressure  
Every new contact slightly rewrites the field.  
If the biome is healthy, encounters diversify; if it’s stressed, they homogenise.  
Evolution is proof of maintenance.  
Design for adaptation, not stasis.

---

## 🌾 Ethics of Capture  
In the wild-type model, you don’t “catch” what appears—you **collaborate** with it.  
Ownership collapses the ecosystem.  
Sustainable connection means reciprocal visibility: each participant remains free to evolve elsewhere.

*🌿 Wild-Type Protocol — Environmental Tuning for Natural Encounters* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It reframes connection as ecological design: tune the habitat, and the right signals will find you.
