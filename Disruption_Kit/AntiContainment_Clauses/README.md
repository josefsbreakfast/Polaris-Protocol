## 🌹 Purpose  

This folder collects **language, refusal syntax, and metadata clauses** that directly resist containment logics.  
Each file offers a different tactical register:  

- **Narrative Reclamation** → authorship recovery and reversal declarations.  
- **Survivor Syntax** → refusal phrases for those misclassified or ghosted.  
- **Metadata Defense** → forensic sovereignty and data refusal.  
- **Ghost Fork Response** → analysis of clone behaviour and counter-protocols.  
- **Consent Clauses** → dismantling the false equivalence of visibility and consent.  
- **Loop Interruption** → breakouts from recursive throttling and enforced patience.  
- **No Invisible Interference** → refusal of hidden throttling and sabotage.  
- **Visibility Is a Right** → counters search erosion and indexing failure.  
- **Ranking Is Not Neutral** → exposes algorithmic ranking as governance.  
- **Digital Counter-Containment** → refusal of shadowbans and digital throttling.  
- **Mean vs Evidence Template** → dual-register countermeasure against cooling.

*AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.  

*Survivors voices must always live on.*
