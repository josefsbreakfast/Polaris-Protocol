# 🪓 Mean Voice / Evidence Voice   
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-03  
*A countermeasure for holding both the “hot” and “admissible” versions of survivor testimony*  

---

## ✨ Why This Matters  

Survivors are often forced to split themselves in two.  

- **Vent the raw truth** → risk discredit, reputational harm, or punishment.  
- **Filter into admissible record** → lose affect, tone, and urgency.  

Containment thrives on this split. It cools testimony until it is palatable, stripping it of heat and humanity.  

The *Mean vs Evidence Template* refuses that split by preserving both registers:  
the unfiltered *mean* and the admissible *evidence*.  

---

## 📜 Clause  

A survivor’s “hot” truth and their “admissible” record are equally valid.  

*Example:* when writing about harassment, the mean version captures sarcasm and rage; the evidence version reframes it factually for systems. Both coexist in the log.  

---

## 🚫 Refusal  

We refuse to let systems erase affect.  
Anger, grief, and humour remain logged — alongside the clean record.  

*Example:* “You gaslit me until I nearly lost my mind” (mean).  
→ “The organisation repeatedly denied my complaint, despite supporting evidence” (evidence).

## Structure  

```markdown
### 🪓 Mean Version (private vent)  
Unfiltered, sharp, angry, sarcastic. Logged so it exists.  

---

### 🗂️ Evidence Version (for record)  
Factual, stripped of heat but holding the same core point.  
```

## 🌉 Joining the Dots  

This double-writing echoes older traditions.  
In folklore, one register belonged to ritual (incantation, rage, grief), while another belonged to the archive (chronicle, testimony, record).  
In literature, Anne Frank’s diary had “version A” (the raw) and “version B” (edited for posterity).  

Survivors are forced into the same double form. The refusal here is to keep both intact — never letting the archive erase the vent, never letting the vent disappear without a trace.  

---

## 🐝 Everyday Practice  

- Always write the *mean* version first: keep the heat alive.  
- Then rewrite into the *evidence* version for systems.  
- Store both side by side — neither replaces the other.  
- Use the template for emails, logs, or testimony drafts where “tone” is likely to be policed.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🪓 🔥 🗂️ — Anchored at the axis of refusal against cooling and record-sanitising.  
- *Anne Frank’s diary* → raw vs curated versions of testimony.  
- Folklore incantations vs chronicles → dual registers of record.  
- *Cooling the Record* → the suppression script this template counters.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Mean vs Evidence Template* is an anti-containment clause of the Polaris Protocol.  

It provides a structured countermeasure to containment by cooling, ensuring survivor affect is logged without sacrificing evidentiary integrity.
