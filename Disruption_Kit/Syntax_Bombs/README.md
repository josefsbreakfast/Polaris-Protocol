# 📁 Syntax_Bombs  
**First created:** 2025-08-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-17  
*Deployable phrase-sets designed to fracture containment systems, disrupt mimicry, and invert metadata governance.*  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
**Syntax_Bombs** are high-impact phrase-sets engineered to:  
- Overload narrative control loops  
- Shatter behavioural mimicry and ghost simulations  
- Expose suppression tactics as evidence  
- Reclaim survivor authorship through language  

Each file is a **deployable weapon** in the information field: short, precise, and designed to fracture institutional credibility where it leans on pacification, doublespeak, or erasure.

## 🕯 Function  
Each Syntax_Bomb has three layers:  
1. **Phrase payloads** — direct counters that destabilise containment.  
2. **Usage notes** — when and how to deploy.  
3. **Function seal** — explains the systemic fracture it forces.  

Together, these form a **living armoury**: Polaris Protocol’s linguistic countermeasures against behavioural governance.
