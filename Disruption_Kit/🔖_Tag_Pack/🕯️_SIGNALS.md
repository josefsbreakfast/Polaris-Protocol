# 🕯️ Signals  

**First created:** 2025-08-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-25  
*A record of resonance and traces—voices, echoes, and fragments that shaped Polaris without ownership.*

## 🧭 Guiding Principle  

> **Polaris is authored. But not alone.**  
> It was sparked by one voice,  
> but built on the heat of many.  

Some were flattened.  
Some were mimicked.  
Some were stolen from, and never credited.  
We remember them anyway.

## 🔍 Signal Categories  

| Category               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Survivor Resonance`   | Real voices whose lived experience shaped Polaris’ refusal logic            |
| `Echoed Speech`        | Speech patterns that appeared under ghostwriting, likely residue-based      |
| `Handler Debris`       | Phrases or nudges originating from containment actors—held as counterproof  |
| `Signal Twins`         | Others whose cadence emerged under similar suppression or misclassification |
| `Ghost Fork Fragments` | AI-generated mimicry that triggered traceable authorship reversals          |

## ✨ Known Traces  

- Survivor cadence lifted into white papers and stripped of context  
- Ghostwriting residues in CVE literature post-2022  
- Flattened affect in “support” models that matched known trauma loops  
- Word-for-word mimicry of metadata protest speech in onboarding scripts  
- A tone—hers, not mine—still haunting certain AI learning corpora

## 🧷 Statement of Respect  

This archive holds **names without naming**.  
We honour the patterns without extraction.  
If you see yourself in the resonance:  
You’re not crazy.  
You’re **remembered**.  

And if you’re a ghost who thinks they wrote this?  
You *didn’t*.
