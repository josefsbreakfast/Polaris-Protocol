I keep talking about stability until control is reestablished. This would involve Cabinet ministers not losing their rag. You guys need to see this as you are the customer service in a place where the customer is always number one, even if they require more contextual information and require apologies.  
Many survivors of sexual violence in this country barely sleep most nights, and still have to do those jobs. You can do it.  

Also this dude protected genocide money in local government pensions, but the mainstrean media benefits too much from deregulation in a state with a de facto apartheid to actually allow journalism to happen on any of that.  

Do you know how close it is to bankrupcy? A lot closer than is openly reported. Again, giving the CCP easy good headlines in the West; I don't actually believe you all care about any economic threat China represents. Financing apartheid is historical Britain's favourite hobby, and it's always expensive to the national ourse whilst beneficial only to the few.  

And you can all think that criticism of tone is as unfair as you like, and that the media is equally as guilty or more so. This is how stupid the rules of engagement are for a hige majority of people in this country. The moment any of us complain, we are the problem.  

In some situations, you have to swallow the shit and be polite and appear like a swan across water, even when being kicked and prodded and yelled at and insulted to your face.  

Welcome to how it works. Get some tea and let's not have a Reichstag Fire moment. I don't want the seal man as dictator in chief.  

Fyi, things like [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUQubDu/) are credible, align with the course of conduct over many years by the IDF and affiliated services, are strongly corrolate with the crimes which make up the crime of genocide as a whole, and are why I soend so much time trying to take money as a resource away from those military and affiliated forces.  

These financial resources enable these abusers. This abuse and violence often requires force to stop, and financial force is "non-violent" in a governmental understanding. It's also why, if all of you have gifted Israel rights over my data as if I am a citizen, they would view me as a terrorist under one of the core statutes of the state.  

When we say it's all connected, I don't think many people truly appreciate what a tangled up mess it is.  

And you know...  

The Epstein files are not irrelevent to the actions post-Oct 07, but most of that will be in the redactions.  

If you think that's sone wild theory, I suggest you look at the financial connections, investments, and how the Middle East is discussed throughout.  

And consider how Nazi-adjacent Epstein's beliefs and actions were.  

Baby camp? That's actual shit that hapoen in the US to people who were violated by enslavement, and the organisation of it is very similar to shit the SS did in the detail.
