I keep talking about stability until control is reestablished. This would involve Cabinet ministers not losing their rag. You guys need to see this as you are the customer service in a place where the customer is always number one, even if they require more contextual information and require apologies.  
Many survivors of sexual violence in this country barely sleep most nights, and still have to do those jobs. You can do it.  

Also this dude protected genocide money in local government pensions, but the mainstrean media benefits too much from deregulation in a state with a de facto apartheid to actually allow journalism to happen on any of that.  

Do you know how close it is to bankrupcy? A lot closer than is openly reported. Again, giving the CCP easy good headlines in the West; I don't actually believe you all care about any economic threat China represents. Financing apartheid is historical Britain's favourite hobby, and it's always expensive to the national ourse whilst beneficial only to the few.  

And you can all think that criticism of tone is as unfair as you like, and that the media is equally as guilty or more so. This is how stupid the rules of engagement are for a hige majority of people in this country. The moment any of us complain, we are the problem.  

In some situations, you have to swallow the shit and be polite and appear like a swan across water, even when being kicked and prodded and yelled at and insulted to your face.  

Welcome to how it works. Get some tea and let's not have a Reichstag Fire moment. I don't want the seal man as dictator in chief.  

Fyi, things like [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUQubDu/) are credible, align with the course of conduct over many years by the IDF and affiliated services, are strongly corrolate with the crimes which make up the crime of genocide as a whole, and are why I soend so much time trying to take money as a resource away from those military and affiliated forces.  

These financial resources enable these abusers. This abuse and violence often requires force to stop, and financial force is "non-violent" in a governmental understanding. It's also why, if all of you have gifted Israel rights over my data as if I am a citizen, they would view me as a terrorist under one of the core statutes of the state.  

When we say it's all connected, I don't think many people truly appreciate what a tangled up mess it is.  

And you know...  

The Epstein files are not irrelevent to the actions post-Oct 07, but most of that will be in the redactions.  

If you think that's sone wild theory, I suggest you look at the financial connections, investments, and how the Middle East is discussed throughout.  

And consider how Nazi-adjacent Epstein's beliefs and actions were.  

Baby camp? That's actual shit that hapoen in the US to people who were violated by enslavement, and the organisation of it is very similar to shit the SS did in the detail.  

The man wasn't a genius. He was an abusive piece of shit, and a control freak, with a highly inflated sense of self.

It's also worth noting, I'm not criticising people who are asking for a step down. I am just hyper aware of the alter rate because I've been exposed to so much content because of who has been very interested in looking at me. This is placed Me algorithmically in a scenario where I am very very aware of the risk that reform UK pose, and I'm very aware that they are taking that by election to be a marker of whether they can progress with what is essentially a plant UK specific consolidation of political power.  

It's not that I think the labour government and its current form is great. It's not that I don't think it would need significant changes to continue. It's that I really don't want to have to have an increase in botched immigration enforcement violence towards the poor the immigrant the feminine....  

The reason that I keep comparing this around the Reichstag fire is that my chief concern here is that we are altogether two fascist right now anyway, but that that political organisation in particular, represents a real threat to consolidation of that power in a more formal way and frankly I am not in the mood for more fascists.  

quite frankly, if the mainstream immediate actually gave a shit about survivors, it would be pressing for the full release of the Epstein files in the US, and it would start asking a lot more people, including Nigel Farage what the fuck they were doing hanging around with a massive nonce.  

At least with Mandelson it's like we all knew, I don't think we can also say we were lied to it was very obvious. But in reality a lot of people, including but not limited to Nigel Farage, are not being fully honest about their connections.  

He has been asked once I think by mainstream media, he's given one sentence. For me personally, that doesn't bail you out of scrutiny. If reform UK are refusing questions on this, that is relevant and useful unnecessary emissions for the public to know.  

Again, this is why I'm not absolutely desperate to change leadership when it is the full circus of the thing that is a problem.  

Finally enough, I don't think the former director of public prosecutions it's the entire problem when it comes to cutting ties with nonces in Whitehall. People can keep saying that he should've exercised better judgement, actually it appears that this entire part of society in this very small area of London, thrives off decision-making that looks like this, and continuously reinforces making these choices, and never brings the amount of scrutiny required that assist the British public in making a full informed choice on election day.  

If the BBC was really acting as a public service broadcaster, it would be asking that bloke some questions. Frankly, I don't even need to know about sexual crimes, as much as I need to know why there were financial links and why there was funding.  

If you exploit people in one way you tend to exploit them in other ways. It is very clear that there was a lot of money being used for political purposes, it is very clear that what this group wanted was a increasingly authoritarian world, presumably so they could continue doing whatever the fuck they wanted and feel like big men when really inside their little boys who have never grown up.  

There is really easy questioning here for the British media, because Nigel Farage has made such a song and dance about violence against women and girls when it is perpetrated by men who are not originally from this country, and it will be so easy to ask why the fuck you decided to do any business with men who are not from this country, who were clearly noted for their violence against women and children.  

If you really gave a shit about what you say you're giving a shit about, why did you have anything to do with this man?  

It would be so easy right now for the conservatives, (not for the labour party, that will look like weasel behaviour), the liberal Democrats, the BBC, the mainstream media as a whole, to just ask the fucking questions.  

And if the man gets shirty if the people in that party gets shirty, all you need to do is say exactly what they would say in the same scenario:  

"I'm just asking questions."  

this is what makes me feel like a lot of the people are calling for Starmer's resignation are so unserious about the actual root cause issue.  

This is also why I'm not bothered when it's somebody who shows that they would absolutely ask these questions if they could and they had that standing, when they say he should go.  

It's the consistency and lack of consistency issue for me. It's a really good microcosm of why the British public is so frustrated and drained by this small tiny little area of London and this very small clique of people, who deal in politics and papers.  

If you excuses that you might upset the donors, then you're really just giving the same reason that he was made ambassador, and you don't really have shit to say to the labour party, do you?  

Glass houses. Rocks.

whichever one of the Nazis or nonces (or both, you can be both) is messing around with connectivity and payments and stock in the last 24 hours, you are invited to desist. Whilst I'm sure it makes you feel like a very big boy, in reality it is making you look somewhat pathetic and a bit... "hormonal".  

If that's the best you can manage at pretty reasonable questions being asked, I'm not sure what to tell you.  

It doesn't look very manly.  

If anyone's playing on the correct hat team, this is primarily done through Apple Pay, I'm not sure what the carrier is. I'll test the just card issue only portion at some point.  

I don't want hear anything about the Sabbath when it is quite normal for these services in my life to be interfered with on a regular basis, which means that I'm often doing things opportunistically, and not on a normal person schedule.  

I don't have the luxury of being able to sit down and do a task and it goes through at that time. I have to make the best of what I have, and I'm hardly the only person experiencing this.  

This has become very normal for survivors and whistleblower in both of UK and the United States. There are a number of behaviours which is generated by systems, which look a lot like "passive" intolerance. I use the word passive because it appears to be mathematically driven, and it would be something where plausible deniability would be desired by whoever would design it that way.  

I obviously can't think of any contractors at all.  

(On a genuine point, I don't actually know the contractor, but I do know a lot of contractors whose systems are aligned like this, in a manner that would not be clear to legal or procurement.)  

& you know as discussed...  

Some of you apparently could not check my nationality and just went along and didn't question it when another country made claim to me, and they would consider me a terrorist under their own laws.  

& obviously it's fine to stop the banking of a terrorist. All that washi tape... no normal human has that much washi tape; she must be doing something with it...
