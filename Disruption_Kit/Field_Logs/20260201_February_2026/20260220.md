 As much as I love tech, I am coming to the conclusion that feels inevitable: proprietary technology, even when used for entirely non-recreational purposes, has put us in a place alike to having cocaine as a first-line analgesic agent. It's not that it *doesn't* work, but whether it's really what you want to whip out for every headache? Somewhat debatable.
