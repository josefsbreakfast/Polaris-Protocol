 As much as I love tech, I am coming to the conclusion that feels inevitable: proprietary technology, even when used for entirely non-recreational purposes, has put us in a place alike to having cocaine as a first-line analgesic agent. It's not that it *doesn't* work, but whether it's really what you want to whip out for every headache? Somewhat debatable.

I've been experiencing a lot of what I would term nuisance activity for the last 10 or 15 minutes.  

I was quite happy looking at washi stickers and listening to Mozart; I have no intention on coming on here to write.  

I do feel I'm often in a Catch-22 situation: whatever is producing this narcissistic demand within the system, often acts in a way that I am forced to evidence, so simply ignoring it isn't really workable.  

I appreciate that this volume of writing isn't ready something that a lot of people are comfortable with, and I didn't really want to write it, either. I did this because I kept hitting up against an invisible wall, whilst trying to get what are quite basic legal processes sorted.  

Even now as I'm writing this, because I'm dictating, lots of additional words that I'm definitely not annunciating of being added into the sentences, which then require me to go back, check, review, rewrite.  

This is essentially my norm now, and I'm someone who does require dictation for a portion of my experience anyway, because of the profound pain caused by being upright for long periods.
