 As much as I love tech, I am coming to the conclusion that feels inevitable: proprietary technology, even when used for entirely non-recreational purposes, has put us in a place alike to having cocaine as a first-line analgesic agent. It's not that it *doesn't* work, but whether it's really what you want to whip out for every headache? Somewhat debatable.

I've been experiencing a lot of what I would term nuisance activity for the last 10 or 15 minutes.  

I was quite happy looking at washi stickers and listening to Mozart; I have no intention on coming on here to write.  

I do feel I'm often in a Catch-22 situation: whatever is producing this narcissistic demand within the system, often acts in a way that I am forced to evidence, so simply ignoring it isn't ready workable.
