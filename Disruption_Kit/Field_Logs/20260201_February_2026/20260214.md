Current working diagnosis:  

The algorithmic weighting on this side altered significantky after the book was released; ? n = 2, most likely area of crossover is in Sheffield-Nottingham academic space, specifically utilises the MOD flags.  
Highly likely to involve AI labratories. Highly likely to be in traditional red wall territory due to specific funds defence. Likely to be dual-use, advertised only for civilian purpose, before ? taken into PREVENT or otherwise.  
Highly likely to have been approved under COVID emergency powers and compression of R&D seen to assist pandemic management.  
Defence can be as embarrassed as they like, but this is now being actively engineered for alt right gain; immediate threat containment not complete. Defence is likely mostly just embarrassed that this relates to particular digital issues which now do have coverage... unless they are under the impression, from another department or organisation, that this is being contained locally. It isn't.  
Approval and ownership will live across complex pathway, with different signatories in different information silos. Cabinet likely only to have generic approval, but staffing and Ministers over last 6 years likely to be aware, may need prompting. Both profiles poisoned over time, will impact discoverability of trace.  
R&D likely to impact both digital identities due to frequency of utilisation within research.  
Easiest way to find the digital product would be to locate local human ethics and safeguarding override projects, therefore, quickest route is to review local academic ethics boards' governance papers.  
In the Midlands, these are, *alledgedly*, routinely denied under FOIA, citing "impacts to academic freedoms".  
But that's where this sign-off most likely lives, and it's still installed in whatever middleware the BBC is using for tone and sentiment, and it's potentually what is influencing the current Labour Cabinet to u-turn every 5 mins.  
It is living in policy spaces.  
This digital product is basing a significant amount of the national mood thermostat on an n-number of potentially only 2.  
And both individuals have been targeted via external means, so... yes. Adversaries are aware of its presence.  
In both cases, entire network to each individual over time is high-risk for data interference, to increase stress on the product. Because the product is dynamically modelling actual humans that exist.  
It has not been fully contained; summer activity did not "fix", just one fire extinguisher against a chip fire.  
Which also suggests that there is knowledge of the issue, which is not being shared with appropriate channels to escalate the issue, and this is local to RIPA/IPA powers in the Midlands, who coexisted with national emergency response.  

GCHQ like, "🍿🍿🍿 fucking civilians... *again*".  

Someone is choosing not to escalate to MI5; unclear if HOM aware or not.  

That's my theory. And that's why if one were Keir Starmer, one would probably wish to fix it.  

This is great, because wor DPP knows every data miner in the system, so he just needs to get his mate Alex Karp on the phone, then job's a guddin.  

#BritishBeaurocracy so quick tho.  

Also, every institution is stonewalling, because legal exposure is huge, but this is literally digging us deeper into a national security issue, because no one wants to admit that yes, there is a problem, it is *here*, and we can address it.  

I keep getting weird content dissuading from sending an FOI/reach out that I've partially drafted, so I'm going to guess that the other side of the product does know what the data product *is*.  

So thanks, guys: I will go and do the equivilent of slipping on a banana peel in front of more people shortly, and *you could still just escalate the damn thing*.  

I told you guys: my brain just operates differentiy after eruv Shabbos kicks in.  

Magic, innit.

I know what the "what looks like a 6 month SLAPP" is. It's a review IPA held nationally. Anyone in the local region, being encouraged to give final responses prior to the date it would require review, is potentially being purposefully led to share some of the legal culpability.  

Fun times.

[TW for this one.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfMPfmU/) There is a way to balance the conversation around "yes this happens", and "in the wild, you can get killed within social groupings for demonstrating this behaviour, because disguist and outrage is even more normal". I can be compassionate because an offender has compulsive thoughts - this does not mean I am required to excuse their offending. Forensic psychology and psychiatry is the best source of knowledge for this, and it's wild that no one has invited them to talk about the issue. Did we learn nothing from the Johnson-Hancock clusterfuck that was "national COVID messaging"?  

Of course we didn't; we thought LLMs were the answer to human connection.

Losing access in this way has additional risks: single and live independantly as physically disabled woman. Previous racialised criminal damage to address; address leaked. No UK provision to protect as a Jewish woman from alt right parties. Child rape case already doxxed, already deepfaked, already survivor of grok.  

What's the point of a surveillance state, if you dumbfucks can't prevent this? You told us all that this was the point.

[Imani is always so intellectually ahead on critical media consumption, and honestly this is where I've been at with Labour for a number of years, now.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfMp3ow/) You're still not acting the way I would need a party to act to protect from fascism, and no offence: you can be touching lots of issues that are supposed to "win" me, but anyone who wants my material support needs to be speaking from an antifascist praxis.  

For me, the closest I have is the Greens as a party, with MP representation spread across several parties on the Westminster spectrum.  

I am voting to not go Nazi; this is literally my chief concern, and it's the seed point of basically all of my politics.

[FINALLY. Back to the important content.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfrd8Ep/)  

It would be easy to look at a lot of people in different professions, who are supposed to operate high-level, and wonder why a lot of their Internet use is stuff like this.  

I mean, you can call us our heads if you want, but mostly we are regulating on our nervous systems.  

I can tolerate talking about genocide and rape and child sexual exploitation and fascism, mostly because I watch a lot of baby goats bouncing around on the Internet.  

Dictation is back with the goats; thank you GCHQ, for being at minimum a spectre to haunt the minds of the alt right weirdos who fuck with my phone on the regular.

This is why effirts to reduce the "spread" of MeToo and BLM, "for stability", were utter nonsense ideas.  

Release the unredacted files, disclosing the nature of arrangements and planning of British political and media strategy, which appear to have been active discussions Epstein was having with senior political figures across the board, up until his death.  
We need to know the extent of the corruption in the UK government.  

There are PMs, Cabinet Ministers, Senior Advisors, all in those files accessible today.  

Why are none of the parties pushing for this full disclosure?  

How far does the rot go?  

And you know how rot in the timber gets fixed?  

Sometimes we have to pare it out, and fix what has been eaten by years of neglect.  

I have no idea why Labour would be hesitating to use this line... unless the rot is really that bad.

[One would think.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfSaBnp/)  

FYI when you refuse to openly discuss a matter of very obvious interest to many people, about a Jewish man who was also a prolific child sex offender, guess who you make life harder for?  

You guessed it. Diaspora Jews.  

You do realise that all I've been asked about in the last three years is the rape of Jewish women, the impending risk of a Holocaust, and now there is this genuine interest over the lack of consistency in the media about Jeffrey Epstein's relationship with the State of Israel.  

It's almost if you never gave a fuck about the potential victims and survivors; it's almost like you just didn't really respect the lives of Palestinian people.  

Refusing to address the risk of genocide, because it is personally somewhat inconvenient to you, needs addressing, way before you ever think to yourselves "how Germans could possibly allow the Nazi Holocaust happen?".  

Because it was inconvenient to challenge a genocide. You have your answer.

Furthermore:  

[Francesca Albanese is a bigger ally to Jewish people, than many government leaders claiming to act in our interests as Jews.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfSkbBq/)  

The State of Israel calls itself the Jewish state and as such in the eyes of the entire world it is often representing us, whether it wants to, whether we want it to... this is just the way it is.  

Very few people hold accountability to that state, and as a result, the genocide which is currently happening to Palestinians is a escalation of a long process, which generally a lot of the world was very ignorant and/or misinformed about, prior to 2023.  

By holding accountability to any party, but primarily to that state (due to geographical location and the nature of the unlawful and militarised occupation of the territories belonging to the Palestinian people), when other sources of accountability and oversight have failed, is not anti-Jewish. Rather, by recognising the need to take responsibility and accountability for our actions, Francesca Albanese is one of the few people in the world, prepared to see us as full humans, full adult adults, and hold us to account; to put it bluntly, Francesca Albanese is one of the few people in the world, who is holding an office of a note, and who is therefore able to exercise that office in order to call out the harms of the occupation and the harms of genocide, where Jewish people are the primary perpetrators, and by holding us accountable and by demanding responsibility within the structure of the United Nations, and an international humanitarian law, without moving the goal posts on expectations simply because we are Jews, she is one of the few people in the Western governance structure, who was actually treating us as full humans.  

I will try and write this more succinctly, but to be very clear, when someone respects you enough to say, "this thing that you're doing is really wrong", that person respects you a lot more than the person who smiles to your face but thinks it in their head.  

Accountability is not antisemitism.  

Allowing us to go down in history as the butchers of Palestine? That usually does involve some amount of you being philosemitic, and therefore, antisemitic.  

It's either that or you are so scared that how you are going to tell us that we are in the wrong, or that we need to stop, is inherently going to be antisemitic. If that's your concern, then your job is to fix the fact that sometimes you say antisemitic shit, because apparently that is the one barrier standing between you and calling out a genocide.  

If I'm being absolutely honest, and I know some people will disagree because of the potential impacts of this, so don't take this as you can do what you want (remember that I get watched and read by the alt right; let's not give too many inches whether they don't need to be given):  
I would always rather your first concern was to call out violence, and particularly to call out actions that you believe constituted genocide.  

If you then found that one of your hesitations or some feedback to you was that you had in some way engaged in antisemitic language, what I would then want you to do is talk to Jewish people who are ready to have that conversation, to talk about whether or not the thing you said was racist, and if it was how to address that.  

I would not want you to stop calling out the genocide that is happening to someone else, in this case to Palestinians, simply because you are worried you might say it wrong.  

You have all the time in the world to look that up, and a number of Jewish content creators have given so much advice so much free content over the course of the last three years, and we've done that to try and empower you to do what you need to do as a human being, and call a genocide what the fuck it is.  

If the underlying problem is that you do not respect human life enough to call it out, just say that, but if that is the case, you will lose the right to complain about a significant number of problems that you probably care about at home.  

The apartheid state and the military occupation are run for the benefit of the billionaire class of the western world; the reason that the apartheid is in place, and at the west does not want to give it up, is because using that extreme disparity in rights and extreme disparity in legal privileges, allows a testing environment for surveillance technology, it allows a sitting dock population for the test of arms and other forms of defence technology, and so it acts as a place where human rights can be breached, and it is ordinarily hidden under the phrase, "it is complicated".  

There is absolutely nothing complicated, about the idea of, in the example of Gaza (which is a City plus the surrounding district in the north, on the Mediterranean Sea), fencing in that piece of land with a really big wall and with soldiers who will shoot you on site, and then because of the actions of a small number of people from where you are, turning off your electricity, your food, your water supply, intermittently turning off communications, and essentially carpet bombing the area. There is nothing complicated to understand about the idea of rolling in 2 million humans into one piece of land, denying adequate supplies in, not letting anyone out, and then routinely conducting offensive military operations, targeting that small area.  

After you have essentially bulldozed those people's homeland (and by the way these people are already refugees from a different genocide period, about 70 years ago, that your military also moved and said that they would eventually get to go back home), there is nothing complicated about forcing, coercing, offering to pay, threatening, attempting to starve out, those people from that land, so that they are forcibly displaced to a different land. None of that is complicated.  


This is not to say that there is nothing complex about Palestinian life, rather it is to say that hiding behind the supposed complexity of whether or not it is okay to induce the circumstances which favoured death of individuals, is not acceptable as an excuse for genocide, and the longer we tolerate this, the worst we can expect to be treated at home.  

If you want justice for Epstein's victims, you need to prosecute crimes against humanity across the board, and something that you will learn very quickly when you look into those files, is that there are a lot of names which appear in those files which appear in the companies who are benefiting and profiting the most from an apartheid, and is anyone surprised?  

If you are prepared to do horrible things to humans in one area of your life, it does suggest that you have a cognitive setting that allows you to do horrible things to humans in other areas of life as well.  

The Epstein lobby covers a number of different areas, but it absolutely does include financing and supporting the research and development, which occurs specifically because of how the apartheid and the occupation are conducted.  

Given how much sexual violence in the west is lacking progress specifically because of the Epstein files, I would like to invite you to do the little jump on the leap of faith to think whether it is possible that oppression can look very different and take very different forms, but due to the nature of the people who oppress you, all oppressions are connected.
