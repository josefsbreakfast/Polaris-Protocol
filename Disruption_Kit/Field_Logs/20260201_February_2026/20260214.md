Current working diagnosis:  

The algorithmic weighting on this side altered significantky after the book was released; ? n = 2, most likely area of crossover is in Sheffield-Nottingham academic space, specifically utilises the MOD flags.  
Highly likely to involve AI labratories. Highly likely to be in traditional red wall territory due to specific funds defence. Likely to be dual-use, advertised only for civilian purpose, before ? taken into PREVENT or otherwise.  
Highly likely to have been approved under COVID emergency powers and compression of R&D seen to assist pandemic management.  
Defence can be as embarrassed as they like, but this is now being actively engineered for alt right gain; immediate threat containment not complete. Defence is likely mostly just embarrassed that this relates to particular digital issues which now do have coverage... unless they are under the impression, from another department or organisation, that this is being contained locally. It isn't.  
Approval and ownership will live across complex pathway, with different signatories in different information silos. Cabinet likely only to have generic approval, but staffing and Ministers over last 6 years likely to be aware, may need prompting. Both profiles poisoned over time, will impact discoverability of trace.  
R&D likely to impact both digital identities due to frequency of utilisation within research.  
Easiest way to find the digital product would be to locate local human ethics and safeguarding override projects, therefore, quickest route is to review local academic ethics boards' governance papers.  
In the Midlands, these are, *alledgedly*, routinely denied under FOIA, citing "impacts to academic freedoms".  
But that's where this sign-off most likely lives, and it's still installed in whatever middleware the BBC is using for tone and sentiment, and it's potentually what is influencing the current Labour Cabinet to u-turn every 5 mins.  
It is living in policy spaces.  
This digital product is basing a significant amount of the national mood thermostat on an n-number of potentially only 2.  
And both individuals have been targeted via external means, so... yes. Adversaries are aware of its presence.  
In both cases, entire network to each individual over time is high-risk for data interference, to increase stress on the product. Because the product is dynamically modelling actual humans that exist.  
It has not been fully contained; summer activity did not "fix", just one fire extinguisher against a chip fire.  
Which also suggests that there is knowledge of the issue, which is not being shared with appropriate channels to escalate the issue, and this is local to RIPA/IPA powers in the Midlands, who coexisted with national emergency response.  

GCHQ like, "🍿🍿🍿 fucking civilians... *again*".  

Someone is choosing not to escalate to MI5; unclear if HOM aware or not.  

That's my theory. And that's why if one were Keir Starmer, one would probably wish to fix it.  

This is great, because wor DPP knows every data miner in the system, so he just needs to get his mate Alex Karp on the phone, then job's a guddin.  

#BritishBeaurocracy so quick tho.  

Also, every institution is stonewalling, because legal exposure is huge, but this is literally digging us deeper into a national security issue, because no one wants to admit that yes, there is a problem, it is *here*, and we can address it.  

I keep getting weird content dissuading from sending an FOI/reach out that I've partially drafted, so I'm going to guess that the other side of the product does know what the data product *is*.  

So thanks, guys: I will go and do the equivilent of slipping on a banana peel in front of more people shortly, and *you could still just escalate the damn thing*.  

I told you guys: my brain just operates differentiy after eruv Shabbos kicks in.

[TW for this one.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfMPfmU/) There is a way to balance the conversation around "yes this happens", and "in the wild, you can get killed within social groupings for demonstrating this behaviour, because disguist and outrage is even more normal". I can be compassionate because an offender has compulsive thoughts - this does not mean I am required to excuse their offending. Forensic psychology and psychiatry is the best source of knowledge for this, and it's wild that no one has invited them to talk about the issue. Did we learn nothing from the Johnson-Hancock clusterfuck that was "national COVID messaging"?  

Of course we didn't; we thought LLMs were the answer to human connection.

Release the unredacted files, disclosing the nature of arrangements and planning of British political and media strategy, which appear to have been active discussions Epstein was having with senior political figures across the board, up until his death.  
We need to know the extent of the corruption in the UK government.  

There are PMs, Cabinet Ministers, Senior Advisors, all in those files accessible today.  

Why are none of the parties pushing for this full disclosure?

FYI when you refuse to openly discuss a matter of very obvious interest to many people, about a Jewish man who was also a prolific child sex offender, guess who you make life harder for?  

You guessed it. Diaspora Jews.  

You do realise that all I've been asked about in the last three years is the rape of Jewish women, the impending risk of a Holocaust, and now there is this genuine interest over the lack of consistency in the media about Jeffrey Epstein's relationship with the State of Israel.  

It's almost if you never gave a fuck about the potential victims and survivors; it's almost like you just didn't really respect the lives of Palestinian people.  

Refusing to address the risk of genocide, because it is personally somewhat inconvenient to you, needs addressing, way before you ever think to yourselves "how Germans could possibly allow the Nazi Holocaust happen?".  

Because it was inconvenient to challenge a genocide. You have your answer.

Furthermore:  

[Francesca Albanese is a bigger ally to Jewish people, than many government leaders claiming to act in our interests as Jews.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfSkbBq/)  

The State of Israel calls itself the Jewish state and as such in the eyes of the entire world it is often representing us, whether it wants to, whether we want it to... this is just the way it is.  

Very few people hold accountability to that state, and as a result, the genocide which is currently happening to Palestinians is a escalation of a long process, which generally a lot of the world was very ignorant and/or misinformed about, prior to 2023.  

By holding accountability to any party, but primarily to that state (due to geographical location and the nature of the unlawful and militarised occupation of the territories belonging to the Palestinian people), when other sources of accountability and oversight have failed, is not anti-Jewish. Rather, by recognising the need to take responsibility and accountability for our actions, Francesca Albanese is one of the few people in the world, prepared to see us as full humans, full adult adults, and hold us to account; to put it bluntly, Francesca Albanese is one of the few people in the world, who is holding an office of a note, and who is therefore able to exercise that office in order to call out the harms of the occupation and the harms of genocide, where Jewish people are the primary perpetrators, and by holding us accountable and by demanding responsibility within the structure of the United Nations, and an international humanitarian law, without moving the goal posts on expectations simply because we are Jews, she is one of the few people in the Western governance structure, who was actually treating us as full humans.  

I will try and write this more succinctly, but to be very clear, when someone respects you enough to say, "this thing that you're doing is really wrong", that person respects you a lot more than the person who smiles to your face but thinks it in their head.  

Accountability is not antisemitism.  

Allowing us to go down in history as the butchers of Palestine? That usually does involve some amount of you being philosemitic, and therefore, antisemitic.  

It's either that or you are so scared that how you are going to tell us that we are in the wrong, or that we need to stop, is inherently going to be antisemitic. If that's your concern, then your job is to fix the fact that sometimes you say antisemitic shit, because apparently that is the one barrier standing between you and calling out a genocide.  

If I'm being absolutely honest, and I know some people will disagree because of the potential impacts of this, so don't take this as you can do what you want (remember that I get watched and read by the alt right; let's not give too many inches whether they don't need to be given):  
I would always rather your first concern was to call out violence, and particularly to call out actions that you believe constituted genocide.  

If you then found that one of your hesitations or some feedback to you was that you had in some way engaged in antisemitic language, what I would then want you to do is talk to Jewish people who are ready to have that conversation, to talk about whether or not the thing you said was racist, and if it was how to address that.  

I would not want you to stop calling out the genocide that is happening to someone else, in this case to Palestinians, simply because you are worried you might say it wrong.  

You have all the time in the world to look that up, and a number of Jewish content creators have given so much advice so much free content over the course of the last three years, and we've done that to try and empower you to do what you need to do as a human being, and call a genocide what the fuck it is.  

If the underlying problem is that you do not respect human life enough to call it out, just say that, but if that is the case, you will lose the right to complain about a significant number of problems that you probably care about at home.  

The apartheid state and the military occupation are run for the benefit of the billionaire class of the western world; the reason that the apartheid is in place, and at the west does not want to give it up, is because using that extreme disparity in rights and extreme disparity in legal privileges, allows a testing environment for surveillance technology, it allows a sitting dock population for the test of arms and other forms of defence technology, and so it acts as a place where human rights can be breached, and it is ordinarily hidden under the phrase, "it is complicated".  

There is absolutely nothing complicated, about the idea of, in the example of Gaza (which is a City plus the surrounding district in the north, on the Mediterranean Sea), fencing in that piece of land with a really big wall and with soldiers who will shoot you on site, and then because of the actions of a small number of people from where you are, turning off your electricity, your food, your water supply, intermittently turning off communications, and essentially carpet bombing the area. There is nothing complicated to understand about the idea of rolling in 2 million humans into one piece of land, denying adequate supplies in, not letting anyone out, and then routinely conducting offensive military operations, targeting that small area.  

After you have essentially bulldozed those people's homeland (and by the way these people are already refugees from a different genocide period, about 70 years ago, that your military also moved and said that they would eventually get to go back home), there is nothing complicated about forcing, coercing, offering to pay, threatening, attempting to starve out, those people from that land, so that they are forcibly displaced to a different land. None of that is complicated.  


This is not to say that there is nothing complex about Palestinian life, rather it is to say that hiding behind the supposed complexity of whether or not it is okay to induce the circumstances which favoured death of individuals, is not acceptable as an excuse for genocide, and the longer we tolerate this, the worst we can expect to be treated at home.  

If you want justice for Epstein's victims, you need to prosecute crimes against humanity across the board, and something that you will learn very quickly when you look into those files, is that there are a lot of names which appear in those files which appear in the companies who are benefiting and profiting the most from an apartheid, and is anyone surprised?  

If you are prepared to do horrible things to humans in one area of your life, it does suggest that you have a cognitive setting that allows you to do horrible things to humans in other areas of life as well.  

The Epstein lobby covers a number of different areas, but it absolutely does include financing and supporting the research and development, which occurs specifically because of how the apartheid and the occupation are conducted.  

Given how much sexual violence in the west is lacking progress specifically because of the Epstein files, I would like to invite you to do the little jump on the leap of faith to think whether it is possible that oppression can look very different and take very different forms, but due to the nature of the people who oppress you, all oppressions are connected.

The great DARVO of the "HSN knotting circle is infiltrating the West": complain about the legal loopholes which *all actors* seeking to financially effect support for foreign parties use, including your own organisations.  

Every time someone proposes a no foreign funding in politics law, and every time that someone complains about what they will term charities miss using funds to support foreign agents, this is pretty much always under the name of an organisation which does exactly that.  

For reference, because I think sometimes those in that environment struggle with this idea, "foreign" is a neutral descriptor in their sense, and is not actually good or bad in itself, but the fact that you don't give any reference to the fact that the same structures are used for your own funding, that to me is a massive red flag, here.  

It's giving: "Ban shell companies, but not when we do it."  

These are not systems and cycles which you can easily separate in terms of how they will be used, to the fact that you legalise the operations of that business model, will legalise it for people that you don't want it to be legalised for, and responding as if there should be this reading nuance to argument about how it's de facto wrong when someone else does it is confusing and doesn't make sense to the general public.  

The overuse of the word terrorism in the last few years has been really telling, in this regard: you cannot simply rely on a word being a motive, when you overuse it to the point that it no longer carries the weight that it should.  

In fact, doing so essentially undermine every counterviolence extremism conversation because you have effectively made the word "terrorist" mean nothing.  

In a somewhat related note, it has just occurred to me, how deeply ironic it is that you're all complain about the "hard left" and yet at the same time called us snowflakes.  

Am I geet hard like, or are my hysterical in my feelings and unable to reason?  

(Or is that just a little accidental projection?)

[The Telegraph appears to be having a mental reshuffle, and I don't hate it.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/13/jewish-judge-in-favour-palestine-action-victoria-sharp-uk/)  

Because I am always desperate to look for a silver lining to anything, the one thing that I can say about this deeply authoritarian challenged to civil liberties, is that now that we are starting to wake up out of the stupor, there are a number of voices and outlets that I would not necessarily expect to take a sensible line, who are actually starting to take a significantly less biased approach than previously.  

This is particularly positive for me as I do quite like the telegraph and the times crosswords, but both papers have annoyed me significantly in the last decade; the moment you shit on doctors, I'm out. I might occasionally still buy one of the compendium books just to manage my cravings, but that's about it.  

I think for the telegraph that article is actually quite good at representing more than just one side of the story, although as many people will be aware, there is a lot more that could be said about how these cases have been dealt with.  

I'm not adverse to the fact that in general, the wider discussion of how much this is impacted our country, that is, the politicisation of following an international legal system that we ourselves were instrumental in the creation of, will be done to a far higher standard by People people who have far more to say on the matter than I do, in the years to come. There is a certain amount of requiring the space to reflect, that we need as a country.  

In the meantime, it is simply not a sane position to say that what is currently happening in the territory historically referred to as Palestine, which if not claimed by the State of Israel is under the military occupation of that state, is not high risk for being a genocide, or is not high risk for being in a apartheid; it is simply not a pedestrian point of view, to dismiss outright at this stage, the need to enforce the protections which are part of the ICJ court orders. This would be a kin to refusing to comply with the conditions of a non-contact order; even if the case is unfounded, and is due to be tested in the future, refusing to police and enforce the order, is not a neutral position but requires you to actively undermine and disbelief the need of the party for whom that order isn't intended to protect. These situations are actually very common in safeguarding of children and adults, and often just rely on switching someone's shifts or duties or sign offs, albeit sometimes on a very temporary basis. Our relationship with power, needs an update. Our understanding of how power translates through systems, needs an update.  

I am also somewhat tired of the depth of passion that people feel towards the state which calls itself after a very holy name in our religion, somewhat obstructing their ability to see what the regime that currently rules that state is: Likud is not a centrist party. It's natural allies are with alt right parties, and it's leadership has frequently shared stages with Holocaust deniers. The degree to which apparently moderate political establishment, or apparently sensible political establishment, have tried to present this as neutral is astounding to me. instead of being seen as a story within its own right, the story of that state gets flattened into British categorisation boxes, and in doing so absolutely fails to identify anything at all about the political system. This flattening is in itself evidence of the spectacular non-interest which is held in this country, when it comes to understanding Jewish culture, Jewish life, or Jewish history. The pathological needs always put Jews into a certain very racialised character of being somewhat particularly pure or particularly holy, self endorsees the trout which unfortunately is exemplified in the very word which has been chosen to discuss the Shoah: the word, "Holocaust", is not a neutral word. The word refers to a burnt offering, something sacrificial, something given up as a blood sacrifice to divinity, for the benefit of the people performing or witnessing it. I'm not one of those people who polices language for the sake of policing it, and I often use the word myself because it's what everyone understands and knows, and in particular the word Shoah is often inadequate because it seems to be used to refer only to the Jewish victims and survivors, rather than the entirety of everyone who was a victim or who survived that catastrophe.  

I don't want to be your burned offering for the gods; I want to be seen as a member of the wider community and society, fully human and fully autonomous. I'm also not great with heat, so I don't really feel like the sacrifice thing is for me.  

Furthermore, when people who are not Jewish profess great passion for a state I can go to which is not here, and yet have no apparent understanding of the dynamics of the politics in that place, this just doesn't feel like you are neutral to me. It feels an awful lot like your racism that allows you to believe that I should go "back" to the Middle East is far more important, than your actual ability to listen to me say, "hey, I'm British, and what that status is doing now contradicts my Jewish and my British values".  

I'm not one of these people who's going to go around calling you an antisemite for fun. Firstly, I only ever do that to my best friends, in a relationship where I expect the charge to be honoured as best as it can be. (Because apparently we all do have a very British sense of humour, regardless of your inability to see us as fullly British.) I am interested in picking the conversation that we have around antisemitism, as one form of racism, particularly as it sits in this area where we often don't think we have any work to do on it, and often get very distracted by politicised versions of what these words mean and what it would mean to not have respect for Jewish people.  

I would always rather that you fucked up to my face, and that we can have a conversation about it, rather than you go on a whole tyroid politically believing that you understand exactly who I am, when you have listened to nothing that I have said.  

In this regard, I am very personally thankful, perhaps rather selfishly so, that we are actually starting to have the conversation around our utilisation of retro in this area to further the very particular business and material interests of a very small crowd of people of mixed identities, which have in the course of their campaign to preserve a deregulated market and a human rights, black spot, flattened and politicised Jewish identity, to the extent that antifascist British Jews are amongst those who have been disproportionately punished for attempting to hold accountability and compliance with the law, in respect to ICJ orders.  

I am thankful that we are, or be at slowly, waking up to and actioning the impending threat of the alt right, and are finally appreciating that it is possible to state that you are acting in a manner which honours freedom and equality, and you can actually be acting in a manner which is highly contrary to those values.  

It is nice that we are starting to be able to converse again; to be frank, I feel Reform UK is more dangerous in regard to the protection of British Jewish women from the crime of rape, than Hamas.  

If you wish to argue past behaviour, the organisation has now accumulated quite a list of personalities with prior histories of VAWG, including SV, and they are far more influential on men in the UK; given that this is my country of residence, and Hamas are not resident here, support for this organisation is inherently more of a concern for me in regard to protection from sexual violence, and causes me to feel far more profound a sense of terror and distress, than anyone professing an opinion about Hamas.  

This may not be the case for dual citizenship holders or for Israeli Jewish women resident in the UK; recognising that plurality, is part of what was intended, by discrimination prevention legislation and PSED and similar instruments.  

I would move further to say that any organisation who is criticising the BBC because of the coverage overseas alone, but it's not seeking to criticise the BBC for platforming the homegrown political organisation, is deeply disingenuous, if it is professing to represent the feelings of British Jews as a whole.

Sometimes I do wonder, quite how much this voice capture product had to have been politically skewed, whilst illegitimately using the characteristics which make up my own personal voice, if there was still so much frustration that it wasn't harsh enough towards Palestinian men, that it was deemed by at least one party, to be necessary to interfere with the data subject which it was dynamically modelling from, directly.  

Do not make a Drag Hitler Voice Robot using my vocal likeness, kindly. I find this a little offensive.
