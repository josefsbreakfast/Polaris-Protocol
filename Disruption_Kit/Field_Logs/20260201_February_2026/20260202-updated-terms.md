 There will be a period in the coming weeks, where the structure of the repo will be shifting significantly.  

 The time for defence is over.   The new structure will move from a place of fear and survival at cost, and under duress, and it will position as proactive and justice-centred, as a systems analysis of the nature of power and its consequences.  

 This is still written under duress, and will mark a transition period, towards building systems of power which are resilient and prosocial.  

It is your own responsibility to take notes in this class, chaps. Do keep up.
