I should probably note that a lot of my texts from other people who have been delayed by a few hours, and I just want to know that there is a lot of material that suggests that I'm still in centroid with a number of people who are absolutely kill us about how human beings process  emotions. It's very funny.

I don't know who herded all the nonces on the dark web and sent them over, but this was way before I was writing online.  

I might feel differently, had there not now been multiple attempts to prevent my use of formal safeguarding machnisms which are designed to protect from these impacts.  

One of the moments that repkays for me, when being led to a cell, is a male voice who says, "It is for your own good".  

Just be a good girl; don't ask questions.  

Who has a black book full of the people who say things like this, and do you still want them to hold influence?

I've been getting ads for celebrant training for some months now. Not always with the churches, more with local MP videos. It's weird.

[We don't even really need the files, I just think the pressure is strategically useful.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRf5aShX/)  

We have surveillance states. We just need to look at who won't regulate, who helps with legal carve outs, who won't press public concerns, who fails to escalate, who signs off... all you ever need to ask is who benefits, and you find your harm network.  

If surveillance worked for the public good, there wouldn't be a trafficking ring this prolific over this long.  

Sounds scary, but less so that you think, when you realise how easy it is to undermine, to pressure, and to divest.  

You can force democracy; you can resist fascism.  

All totalitarian regiemes deserve resistance, especially ones made uo of a bunch of such losers.

We do all realise that by having what is very CIA and NSA adjacent within the UK digotal ecosystem, that is a big part of why Russia keeps doing recon on our cable pipelines, and ultimately they can not only access but also penetrate? So we're jyst caught inbetween two dickheads flopping the big elephant-trunk-style dildos on their heads at each other, essentially holding us in deliberate stagnation, financially amd socially, because they're busy comparing who was the longest, floppiest, dildohead?  

I'm not seeing how this is the "Cool Britannia" as I was promised in the 90s when you sold this to me.

["I don't know how it happened, and I'll never work out why, We consented for to lie down in this grave."](https://youtu.be/5eTMmK-JAmA?si=XQ12K2IkFLOT05_o)  

🎶:  

"In my primary school assembly, I sang with folded hands,  
Of green and pleasant lands where I was made.  
Now my autumn years approach me, my home's still England's soil;  
These days how I recoil from the parade,  
As we turn from compassion, leave our fellows out to die.  
Oh, who will slay the dragon of the 'me, myself, and I'?  
I don't know how it happened, and I'll never work out why,  
We consented for, to lie down in this grave.  
We consented for – to lie down in this grave.  

But I won't sing. I won't cheer every blunder,  
As they steer us toward the thundеr with our banners all unfurled.  
I won't sing.  
I won't raise my voicе in wonder.  
Serenade as we go under:  
'The best country in the world'.  

Now we're ex-Europeans. Oh, how sweet the hard-won freedoms! –  
...To turn desperate human beings from our shores without delay?  
And when school term is over, what's ten-thousand-odd Land Rovers,  
Queueing at the cliffs of Dover, but a price we're glad to pay?  
We must keep all for ourselves.  
Our empty supermarket shelves,  
Our overcrowded prison cells,  
our classrooms crumbling to bits.  
Striking doctors, striking teachers,  
and no railway lines to reach us.  
We would fight them on the beaches,  but the beach is full of shit.  
But the beach is full of shit.  

So I won't sing.  
I won't cheer every blunder,  
As they steer us toward the thundеr,  
with our banners all unfurled.  
I won't sing.  
I won't raise my voicе in wonder,  
Serenade as we go under: The best country in the world.  

Oh, three cheers for the drivers: we are science deniers.  
Surely petrol will supply us when East Anglia's submerged?  
Dig for coal, dig for "victory", and if that sounds contradictory  
To our goals for 2050? Well, we never meant a word.  
The lungs of London's boys and girls are filling up with poison.  
As the ocean slowly boils, we expand the motorway.  
Oh, you old fool, Britannia.  
Can you be so cruel, Britannia?  
Bow to fossil fuel, Britannia!  
It's your children who will pay.   
It's your children who will pay.  

So I won't sing!  
I won't cheer every blunder,  
As they steer us toward the thundеr with our banners all unfurled.  
I won't sing!  
I won't raise my voicе in wonder,   
Serenade as we go under.  
'The best country in the world'?  
'The best country in the world'!  

So don't sell me a story of a land of hope and glory.  
Well, this land was broke by Tories,  with their hands inside the till.  
And if you want me patriotic? **Put the people over profit** –  
But while they're getting richer off it?  
They never, they *never*, ever will.  

So let's hear you sing:  
For every balls-up and blunder,  
As we sail into the thunder,  
If it's all that we deserve.  

Let's hear you sing!  
All the world will watch in wonder,  
As we tear ourselves asunder –  
Never after to be heard.  

Let's hear you sing! –  
Won't you smile for the cameras?  
And you mind your fucking manners,  
As the storm begins to surge!  

Let's hear you sing –  
Like an ancient demon church choir,  
As you're fleeing from the wildfire,  
With these rotten bones of empire,  
Etched forever, with the words:  
'The best country in the world'."

Ooh. First commit issue for a little while.. you don't like Grace Petrie? I think she's grand.  

Sadly, all of you did such a shit job with the book, that I am having to work a little hard, rather.  

Did quite like the Union Flag Queen, though.  

(I would fight you on the beaches, but as you refuse to nationalise the water industry, and the new regulations will fail the same way, the beaches may be full of shit for quite some time. Rather unsanitary.)  

---

Okay.  
Dictation has been taken away again.    
I've just realised how many songs by Grace have been deleted from my liked songs list.  
I guess that just moved sorting "move from spotify" up the priority list.  

This isn't "free market capitalism" 🤣🤣🤣, is it?  
I thought the prodicts and services were supposed to be, like, not-complete-shit under this economic model?  

(Is it because I block-played "No Woman Ever Wants To Be A Muse" too much?)  

"Because no woman ever wants to be a muse –  
To be dragged over hot coals,  
To be slandered, to be used,  
So you can sing the world your inauthentic blues,  
And be the bravest, be the smartest,  
The most deeply tortured artist.  
Tell me who in their right mind would ever choose,  
To be a muse."  

This is really recent; I've had the somgs on the liked main list within the last week or so.  

This could be towards Grace's algorithmic placement, or otherwise.  

They are using this for authoritarian capture across borders on a tranditional map.  

This really does make it easier to curate my media consumption: if you try to block it, I like it.  

Making legends out of us all, babes.

How is unemployment treating you, or is it just not public yet?

Marriage camps are quite a fascinsting proposal, in that that conceot didn't just enter someone's head, but they carried it out to a policy paper.  

I mean... some people are only ever good at one thing.  

Most of Hitler's top Reich were like that. Weird little men, like tortoises on fenceposts, often only committing atrocities because it made them feel more important.  

Sometimes it only takes hatred of the self, so cultuvated and uncorrected, that it ultimately gets externalised onto people who never deserved it.  

It seems flippant to make comments about the relevance and need of mental health care and community, but these are our best preservatives of our own humanity, and the best prophylaxis.  

This also stands as testimony, to how easy it is to *not* go Nazi.  

---

So: maybe listening to Grace Petrie is dangerous.  

Why was the vigil for Sarah Everard policed like that? Who advised it?  

This has strong overlap with specific concerns which were being discussed, and which shared contracting in the procurement ecosystem, in the 2016-2019 period.  

Who imported this from the US?  

This appears similar to other incidents of proven politically motivated escalation of tactics, flagged as "we have had intelligence that.."; it is not a concern of policing command, as much as who was advising politically on application of policing powers and on how police (who, can we remember, actually habe done this job for a long time prior) ought to conduct operations.  

That information transfer point is going to be a significant factor in capture, and I have some role suggestions.  

Specifically this is authoritarian/fascist/alt right capture, likely transatlantic in nature.  

Likely has a lot to say about Russian threats, despite being a Putin asset. Likely offended by the very suggestion, but.. come on, man.

[Very useful for mapping out the likely influence of the Epstein network, and given that this was authoritarian and cult-like, a reasonable mapping exercise to start strategic planning to reverse capture.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRf5g7aJ/)  

No pasaran.  

This is also an extremely good example of where and when LLM use is extremely effective. & a reminder that the DOJ is performing incompetance out of policy choice. This is how easy it is for journalists to analyse; think of how easy it is for defence and law enforcement.  

Then ask why conviction rates are poor.

[Sky News, are you okay?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRf5VvNx/)  

This is presented as in the ten cities in the US, so normalised, and because we normalised Calais enampments for migrants, we are now normalising the headline issue here not being, "wis that's a lot of people who can't afford a home", into "the council is annoyed they are pooping on the Downs".  

If people were not priced out of housing, they would not be shitting in a fancy field.

You do all realise, too, that a lot of very rich people do think increased wealth tax is sensible, and not (just) as a findom thing?

[Bro do you even realise what a good deal I would get under Sharia law tho? It's basically Halakha with feminist updates; I am down. You can run the bacon sandwich speakeasy. It'll be jokes.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfaSCkR/)  

You get all the pigs you want so bacon is even cheaper; literally what wre you complaining about?  

Oh. Wait.  

Sharia law imposes a few small limits on male culture:  

- women do not get legally absorbed into their husband's identity: this remains a point of contention today, ask any woman titled "Dr" married to a "Mr", but it shows up *frequently* for women  
- women have independent money and assets; they are not acquired by men at marriage  
- 50/50 does not exist; husbands are obligated to maintain women, even if the women are wealthy in their own right
- men give dowry to the bride, not her father; women are contracted with directly, rather than men contracting access upon her behalf
- women have to give positive consent for marriage; arrangements were actually common in white British communities in fairly recent history
- grounds for divorce are far more permissive in Islam compared to most iterations of Christianity, but maintain obligations to a previous spouse's wellbeing (for us if ee married a man, not for you males, obviously)

I could go on.  

If what you are scared of is something you don't understand, the internet has dictionaries and encyclopaedias.  

If what you want to say is that not all expressions of Islam are feminist, and this disadvantages women profoundly, this would also require consistency on your part for all violence against women.  

It is fascinating, however, that as the classical differences include a profoundly more protective status towards women, none of you have noticed this, and do not come ready to fight your argument.  

It suggests you have not even googled, "what is sharia law", which undermines your insistance that I ought to tolerate or listen to the vocalisations that you all seem to want to call your "opinions".  

The Arbitration Act is beneficial to the Jewish community as well, and is excusing you from the extra DEI sessions you would need to take, if we did not have this law.  

Do you want to have to do those modules? They'd be the click-through screens or a powerpoint, too. You know someone is going to say we can't just make it interactive and not a sadistic experiment of HR compliance.  
So what is it you people actually want?  

Diversity did not simply build this country, but what was consumed in cultural diversity gave Britain its imperial wealth and its current "home" culture.  

Do you really think "pyjama" is an English origin word?  

You cannot enjoy the products of diversity, and whine that you occaisionally hear a language you don't follow.  

(Do you want to know the most annoying thing about understanding the little Hindi that I do? I now cannot drown out couples having protracted conversations about their shopping lists, in the supermarket. That is what you are missing out on. Sometimes a conversation just is not relevent to you.)  

So.  

What is it you want?  

If it's to feel more complete for who you are, you will not find it by shitting on others. You will only find it by sitting with yourself.

The convergance of Reform's interests, Labour's defence and foreign policy in 2022 - 2023 (and arguably onwards), and the underpinning if how to manuveor in the forged book, are all similar in respect of, "sit on the fence; teeth out, tits up".  

It only really makes sense if you're trying to pat a spolit little dog on the head and let it feel important, whilst trying to convince it that the master's olans are what is best for it, and it ought not to think too terribly much about threat exposure as a result.  

That isn't really selling being "Great" to me. We are an island of pirates with fancy wardrobes; we get bored.  

It's also weirdly handwavey about London's financial markets: "leave them as they are, they're fine!"  

Like cool but also this is why people are living in vans in Brighton, so Imma need to hard pass if it means we're not adequately addressing economic risk exposure, thanks.
