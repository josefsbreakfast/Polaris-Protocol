I should probably note that a lot of my texts from other people who have been delayed by a few hours, and I just want to know that there is a lot of material that suggests that I'm still in centroid with a number of people who are absolutely kill us about how human beings process  emotions. It's very funny.

[The idea of being that "controlled" after being "angry enough" to come in armed, is the impact of making it screen testable for male viewers.](https://youtube.com/shorts/d4ZJTToE1og?si=H7LZTofCHguB022X)  

[This is how every algorithm has been for me for some time; always underage, always a normalisation.](https://youtube.com/shorts/l2bQmH6_P0M?si=z4S_-hMrEZ0cZb_x)  

I don't know who herded all the nonces on the dark web and sent them over, but this was way before I was writing online.  

I might feel differently, had there not now been multiple attempts to prevent my use of formal safeguarding machnisms which are designed to protect from these impacts.  

One of the moments that repkays for me, when being led to a cell, is a male voice who says, "It is for your own good".  

Just be a good girl; don't ask questions.  

Who has a black book full of the people who say things like this, and do you still want them to hold influence?

I am tired of being your raycat for these men.  

It's no way to live.

[Product linage includes the ex-PM in the Epstein files, Ehud Barak.](http://youtube.com/post/UgkxZw2av1QluShOpdtnndBEPauFi24F0vaH?si=nNbcLPzZssKl6tN5) Tell me how it definitly isn't weaponisable for CSE, and I might feel better about it.

I've been getting ads for celebrant training for some months now. Not always with the churches, more with local MP videos. It's weird.  
<!--Oh, I'm sorry, did that make someone uncomfortable? 🤣🤣🤣-->
<!--Yeah. Bit quieter when you see how easy it would be, isn't it? Googling took 2 mins, bruv. Behave yourself.-->

[We don't even really need the files, I just think the pressure is strategically useful.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRf5aShX/)  

We have surveillance states. We just need to look at who won't regulate, who helps with legal carve outs, who won't press public concerns, who fails to escalate, who signs off... all you ever need to ask is who benefits, and you find your harm network.  

If surveillance worked for the public good, there wouldn't be a trafficking ring this prolific over this long.  

Sounds scary, but less so that you think, when you realise how easy it is to undermine, to pressure, and to divest.  

You can force democracy; you can resist fascism.  

All totalitarian regiemes deserve resistance, especially ones made uo of a bunch of such losers.

We do all realise that by having what is very CIA and NSA adjacent within the UK digotal ecosystem, that is a big part of why Russia keeps doing recon on our cable pipelines, and ultimately they can not only access but also penetrate? So we're jyst caught inbetween two dickheads flopping the big elephant-trunk-style dildos on their heads at each other, essentially holding us in deliberate stagnation, financially amd socially, because they're busy comparing who was the longest, floppiest, dildohead?  

I'm not seeing how this is the "Cool Britannia" as I was promised in the 90s when you sold this to me.
