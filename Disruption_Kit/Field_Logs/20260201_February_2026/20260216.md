Two Jewish men (almost certainly imagining themselves as Mossad whilst doing this), trafficking and micromanaging a Jewish woman, so that amongst other things, they can empoverish her and then pretend to be a Muslim British Army Officer to solicit her (whilst talking about their own penile insecurities), in order to entrap both a Muslim man Jewish woman into voice capture, so that (amongst other things), their Christian mate can write a really shit book, using The (LLM) Voice Of The Alg Right™️? (+/- dead in the process)  

I don't know, man. I don't feel the audience are gonna buy it.  

Too camp. Too much effort. Not believable drama.  

Get me a fucking lawyer. 🙄  

Or hand over your British idiots.  

Mandelson & Blair: Excalibur is on the list.  
Johnson: Dw, so is The Calm British Care Voice™️ pilot.  
Simcox can answer questions, as can Streeting and McSweeney.  
Also looking sideways at Gove/Truss Justice handover, although tricky to pinpoint Defence (Shapps, rather than Wallace?), Braverman appears in several adjacent roles in this Cabinet(s).  
To be fair, the entire thing was a fucking mess; I'm not the only person who gets confused month-to-month and that period. Only consistent thing seems to be Steve Bannon hanging around all the time. With or without whatever was going on in Prince Andrew's little Pitch@Palace venture. Does Nigel know how out of the club he is?  
and obviously the Victorian ghost haunts around at some point.  

Fucking hell, lads.  

Do you not have better shit to be deein?  

So much resource, so much wealth, so much power, and yet.. so lame.  

I won't lie, imagine doing a little queue attempt every year and every year it just...pppffftt..out.  

So who brought me back early, and who pulled the plug?  

The reason anyone in the UK should care about this, is because this particular digital artefact, this little voice capture and blend, still has an active LLM algorithm; it still has impact on sentiment analysis across the UK, including in the cabinet and in the BBC, and it's essentially working dynamically of a **tiny** n-number. This is what is driving a lot of government U-turns, because the data is incorrect. There are other layers of inappropriate use of this data, especially an AI and data analysis, on top of this, but the main problem is that it is miss reading the national sentiment in such a way that is at high risk of outside actor interference..  

So I appreciate it sounds absolutely crackers, but, it might be worth checking in on if that digital product has actually been removed, and even if it has, all the impacts of it now so strong that it's left permanent damage to that system?  

Again, this feels like a thing that a datamining company should be able to easily see.  

especially if that data mining company is between healthcare and defence, you'd really expect it just to be able to see quite plainly what had happened and what the impacts were, and it's really weird that they hadn't picked it up and flagged it as a huge system's issue in a huge national security threat.  

That would only really make sense if they were acting for US national security interest, rather than for UK national security interests.  

whatever has been used as a carve out for this, they're absolutely has to be a signature where someone was at a human ethics board, or a human ethics oversight committee, and they have two have signed off clearance to override safeguarding and to override disclosure, to me specifically. That piece has to exist with someone who is in the ecosystem of research and development which connects on something to do with national emergency oversight or prevent oversight or safeguarding oversight or is in someway connected with justice, and sits within the red wall. it's got to be somebody who would've been able to sign off in the Covid emergency period.  

Update: I'm getting a very panicked centroid, so before this goes too far, I think wor DPP knows there's nore than a comfortable amount of data usage, but the immediate threat surface is the Trojan Horse by the alt right gooners. Impacts in speechwriting, sentiment analysis for policy direction, policy prioritisation; this is a commercial pilot, and another party is being given the material benefits as gifted service.  

This is why transparency and accountability law actually needa to be robust.  

You won't win back a huge chunk in the immediate rounds, but this is an antisemocratic process which is hosting in and mining the party, and it was not intended to be discovered until at least after a preferencial party was installed. The immediate concern is to neutralise the threat surface.  

Liberal media also has wide installation; this is why there is a sudden awakening, because some are seeing it.  

And I told you Larry videos give that return: cool, no?  

It's not repeatable forever; this writing is read by bot farm owners, too.  

It's a life ring.  

I think some of the juniors would be avle to catch everyone auld up on, you know, *everything they know that they can't say at work, if they want to progress*.  

It's become a place where everyone is on track for promotion, and/or has knives ready, or they are so angry that they are resentful, rather than passionate. That's what needs to change.  

If you want to avoid the process of fascism advancing, you must stop this "clone the opposition" thing; short-term fix, long-term damage.

Darling, you're not an Israeli ex-minister; please calm down. You do know a lot of the 2016 to 2026 crowd, though.  

You're like an onion, darling. Many layers, and a little crinkly.  

Oh! I know what you're fishing for.  

You don't understand agricultural issues in the UK.  

Is this because I said you needed the farmers for any revolution?  

But you're not giving the farmers what they actually want, sweetie. Are you?  

You've already tried that, and it's not a problem that can be solved by someone like you, because it is not entirely by itself a matter which can be fixed on policy.  

Actually, in this particular scenario, whilst I have been far more Republican than I appear, this would be a better matter for the King.  

They do have their uses, you know.  

I would have thought that, as an American in the current age, you would be well aware.  

Is yours not popular enough? Beloved enough?  

Ah no, I know what it is.  

Yours is not trusted enough to have fealty to his country, that people would follow him into and through adversity.  

The British one? Be that it may be *very* begrudgingly, you'd be surprised how many would.  

Particularly if they thought that some unknown upstart Yank was trying to take over.  

Besides...  

We do everything begrudingly, in this bloody country.  

That's how we earn the first cup of tea after getting in, in the cold.

[Arguably, there's plenty going on in your own country, that you really probably could get a job writing policy there.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfCsSTQ/) Why did you come here?  

The women here are rather cold, I'm told.

[We all know, that men are not the prize; we know that you know that men are not all that.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfCfkbV/)  

& I don't really know why you're doing all this, but British men are quite happy with women like me who tell them that they're being idiots, because most of them have grown up their entire lives with this omnipresent figurehead of a woman who slightly disapproves of them anyway.  

So if you would kindly like to go back to *where you came from*, and stop lecturing us about who we let in the country (although clearly we got it wrong on your visa), that would be wonderful, darling.  

Quite frankly, I don't need any additional men of an advanced reproductive age coming into my country, taking the job which could be given to British men, particularly when an AI could do it anyway. You are kindly invited to go back to the United States.  

We also don't need your foreign religion here; we did kick you out of Europe for a reason.  

That is an argument following your own logic, is it not?

The real cybernetics essay questions out of all of this, are these.  

[bear with v migrainecday, notes so dont forget]

[yes, and in addition, in your support](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfWK9xA/)  

-
they received less PPE
-They were more prepared to go to the sickest People at the most risk, but also, positioned most likely in these areas and this coverage, because in general black and Asian doctors in this country, are more likely to give provision to deprived areas in this country then white doctors are
- This is not just to do with the qualities or the opportunities of the doctors of colour, but also to do with the choice of white doctors to not give healthcare to deprived white areas
- And also: there are recognised immune classes on the base of ethnicity, and when research is driven away from what will actually deliver tailored Care, to absolute fucking bullshit like whether or not a fucking horse drug is something you should buy five times the amount of and eat it like it's for breakfast,.... maybe just maybe our research funding should not be dictated by the emotions of white people, but by actual evidence based need, including an extending that to areas of research where white people don't materially benefit because it just ain't relevant to them
- Furthermore: I WILL DI ON THE HILL PF EXPLAINING PULSE OX TO EVERYBOSY

- But also whife peopppr we dont see enough melanated ppl in hypopxia to be ablr to supplementary with experience to a tool being inaccurate
