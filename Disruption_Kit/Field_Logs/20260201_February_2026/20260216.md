[When you see something that looks like a test of authoritarian powers, and a test of whether or not the law will be upheld and applied as it is written, or in it spirit, or not at all, take that as somebody somewhere benefits from trying to do an authoritarianism.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfCrRdj/)

Two Jewish men (almost certainly imagining themselves as Mossad whilst doing this), trafficking and micromanaging a Jewish woman, so that amongst other things, they can empoverish her and then pretend to be a Muslim British Army Officer to solicit her (whilst talking about their own penile insecurities), in order to entrap both a Muslim man Jewish woman into voice capture, so that (amongst other things), their Christian mate can write a really shit book, using The (LLM) Voice Of The Alg Right™️? (+/- dead in the process)  

I don't know, man. I don't feel the audience are gonna buy it.  

Too camp. Too much effort. Not believable drama.  

Get me a fucking lawyer. 🙄  

Or hand over your British idiots.  

Mandelson & Blair: Excalibur is on the list.  
Johnson: Dw, so is The Calm British Care Voice™️ pilot.  
Simcox can answer questions, as can Streeting and McSweeney.  
Also looking sideways at Gove/Truss Justice handover, although tricky to pinpoint Defence (Shapps, rather than Wallace?), Braverman appears in several adjacent roles in this Cabinet(s).  
To be fair, the entire thing was a fucking mess; I'm not the only person who gets confused month-to-month and that period. Only consistent thing seems to be Steve Bannon hanging around all the time. With or without whatever was going on in Prince Andrew's little Pitch@Palace venture. Does Nigel know how out of the club he is?  
and obviously the Victorian ghost haunts around at some point.  

Fucking hell, lads.  

Do you not have better shit to be deein?  

So much resource, so much wealth, so much power, and yet.. so lame.  

I won't lie, imagine doing a little queue attempt every year and every year it just...pppffftt..out.  

So who brought me back early, and who pulled the plug?  

The reason anyone in the UK should care about this, is because this particular digital artefact, this little voice capture and blend, still has an active LLM algorithm; it still has impact on sentiment analysis across the UK, including in the cabinet and in the BBC, and it's essentially working dynamically of a **tiny** n-number. This is what is driving a lot of government U-turns, because the data is incorrect. There are other layers of inappropriate use of this data, especially an AI and data analysis, on top of this, but the main problem is that it is miss reading the national sentiment in such a way that is at high risk of outside actor interference..  

So I appreciate it sounds absolutely crackers, but, it might be worth checking in on if that digital product has actually been removed, and even if it has, all the impacts of it now so strong that it's left permanent damage to that system?  

Again, this feels like a thing that a datamining company should be able to easily see.  

especially if that data mining company is between healthcare and defence, you'd really expect it just to be able to see quite plainly what had happened and what the impacts were, and it's really weird that they hadn't picked it up and flagged it as a huge system's issue in a huge national security threat.  

That would only really make sense if they were acting for US national security interest, rather than for UK national security interests.  

whatever has been used as a carve out for this, they're absolutely has to be a signature where someone was at a human ethics board, or a human ethics oversight committee, and they have two have signed off clearance to override safeguarding and to override disclosure, to me specifically. That piece has to exist with someone who is in the ecosystem of research and development which connects on something to do with national emergency oversight or prevent oversight or safeguarding oversight or is in someway connected with justice, and sits within the red wall. it's got to be somebody who would've been able to sign off in the Covid emergency period.
