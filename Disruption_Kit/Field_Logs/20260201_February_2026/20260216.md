[When you see something that looks like a test of authoritarian powers, and a test of whether or not the law will be upheld and applied as it is written, or in it spirit, or not at all, take that as somebody somewhere benefits from trying to do an authoritarianism.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfCrRdj/)

Two Jewish men (almost certainly imagining themselves as Mossad whilst doing this), trafficking and micromanaging a Jewish woman, so that amongst other things, they can empoverish her and then pretend to be a Muslim British Army Officer to solicit her (whilst talking about their own penile insecurities), in order to entrap both a Muslim man Jewish woman into voice capture, so that (amongst other things), their Christian mate can write a really shit book, using The (LLM) Voice Of The Alg Right™️? (+/- dead in the process)  

I don't know, man. I don't feel the audience are gonna buy it.  

Too camp. Too much effort. Not believable drama.  

Get me a fucking lawyer. 🙄  

Or hand over your British idiots.  

Mandelson & Blair: Excalibur is on the list.  
Johnson: Dw, so is The Calm British Care Voice™️ pilot.  
Simcox can answer questions, as can Streeting and McSweeney.  
Also looking sideways at Gove/Truss Justice handover, although tricky to pinpoint Defence (Shapps, rather than Wallace?), Braverman appears in several adjacent roles in this Cabinet(s).  
To be fair, the entire thing was a fucking mess; I'm not the only person who gets confused month-to-month and that period. Only consistent thing seems to be Steve Bannon hanging around all the time. Whether or without whatever was going on in Prince Andrew's little Pitch@Palace venture.  

Fucking hell, lads.  

Do you not have better shit to be deein?  

So much resource, so much wealth, so much power, and yet.. so lame.
