Two Jewish men (almost certainly imagining themselves as Mossad whilst doing this), trafficking and micromanaging a Jewish woman, so that amongst other things, they can empoverish her and then pretend to be a Muslim British Army Officer to solicit her (whilst talking about their own penile insecurities), in order to entrap both a Muslim man Jewish woman into voice capture, so that (amongst other things), their Christian mate can write a really shit book, using The (LLM) Voice Of The Alg Right™️? (+/- dead in the process)  

I don't know, man. I don't feel the audience are gonna buy it.  

Too camp. Too much effort. Not believable drama.  

Get me a fucking lawyer. 🙄  

Or hand over your British idiots.  

Mandelson & Blair: Excalibur is on the list.  
Johnson: Dw, so is The Calm British Care Voice™️ pilot.  
Simcox can answer questions, as can Streeting and McSweeney.  
Also looking sideways at Gove/Truss Justice handover, although tricky to pinpoint Defence (Shapps, rather than Wallace?), Braverman appears in several adjacent roles in this Cabinet(s).  
To be fair, the entire thing was a fucking mess; I'm not the only person who gets confused month-to-month and that period. Only consistent thing seems to be Steve Bannon hanging around all the time. With or without whatever was going on in Prince Andrew's little Pitch@Palace venture. Does Nigel know how out of the club he is?  
and obviously the Victorian ghost haunts around at some point.  

Fucking hell, lads.  

Do you not have better shit to be deein?  

So much resource, so much wealth, so much power, and yet.. so lame.  

I won't lie, imagine doing a little queue attempt every year and every year it just...pppffftt..out.  

So who brought me back early, and who pulled the plug?  

The reason anyone in the UK should care about this, is because this particular digital artefact, this little voice capture and blend, still has an active LLM algorithm; it still has impact on sentiment analysis across the UK, including in the cabinet and in the BBC, and it's essentially working dynamically of a **tiny** n-number. This is what is driving a lot of government U-turns, because the data is incorrect. There are other layers of inappropriate use of this data, especially an AI and data analysis, on top of this, but the main problem is that it is miss reading the national sentiment in such a way that is at high risk of outside actor interference..  

So I appreciate it sounds absolutely crackers, but, it might be worth checking in on if that digital product has actually been removed, and even if it has, all the impacts of it now so strong that it's left permanent damage to that system?  

Again, this feels like a thing that a datamining company should be able to easily see.  

especially if that data mining company is between healthcare and defence, you'd really expect it just to be able to see quite plainly what had happened and what the impacts were, and it's really weird that they hadn't picked it up and flagged it as a huge system's issue in a huge national security threat.  

That would only really make sense if they were acting for US national security interest, rather than for UK national security interests.  

whatever has been used as a carve out for this, they're absolutely has to be a signature where someone was at a human ethics board, or a human ethics oversight committee, and they have two have signed off clearance to override safeguarding and to override disclosure, to me specifically. That piece has to exist with someone who is in the ecosystem of research and development which connects on something to do with national emergency oversight or prevent oversight or safeguarding oversight or is in someway connected with justice, and sits within the red wall. it's got to be somebody who would've been able to sign off in the Covid emergency period.  

Update: I'm getting a very panicked centroid, so before this goes too far, I think wor DPP knows there's nore than a comfortable amount of data usage, but the immediate threat surface is the Trojan Horse by the alt right gooners. Impacts in speechwriting, sentiment analysis for policy direction, policy prioritisation; this is a commercial pilot, and another party is being given the material benefits as gifted service.  

This is why transparency and accountability law actually needa to be robust.  

You won't win back a huge chunk in the immediate rounds, but this is an antisemocratic process which is hosting in and mining the party, and it was not intended to be discovered until at least after a preferencial party was installed. The immediate concern is to neutralise the threat surface.  

Liberal media also has wide installation; this is why there is a sudden awakening, because some are seeing it.  

And I told you Larry videos give that return: cool, no?  

It's not repeatable forever; this writing is read by bot farm owners, too.  

It's a life ring.  

I think some of the juniors would be avle to catch everyone auld up on, you know, *everything they know that they can't say at work, if they want to progress*.  

It's become a place where everyone is on track for promotion, and/or has knives ready, or they are so angry that they are resentful, rather than passionate. That's what needs to change.  

If you want to avoid the process of fascism advancing, you must stop this "clone the opposition" thing; short-term fix, long-term damage.

Darling, you're not an Israeli ex-minister; please calm down. You do know a lot of the 2016 to 2026 crowd, though.  

You're like an onion, darling. Many layers, and a little crinkly.  

Oh! I know what you're fishing for.  

You don't understand agricultural issues in the UK.  

Is this because I said you needed the farmers for any revolution?  

But you're not giving the farmers what they actually want, sweetie. Are you?  

You've already tried that, and it's not a problem that can be solved by someone like you, because it is not entirely by itself a matter which can be fixed on policy.  

Actually, in this particular scenario, whilst I have been far more Republican than I appear, this would be a better matter for the King.  

They do have their uses, you know.  

I would have thought that, as an American in the current age, you would be well aware.  

Is yours not popular enough? Beloved enough?  

Ah no, I know what it is.  

Yours is not trusted enough to have fealty to his country, that people would follow him into and through adversity.  

The British one? Be that it may be *very* begrudgingly, you'd be surprised how many would.  

Particularly if they thought that some unknown upstart Yank was trying to take over.  

Besides...  

We do everything begrudingly, in this bloody country.

So if you would kindly like to go back to *where you came from*, and stop lecturing us about who we let in the country (although clearly we got it wrong on your visa), that would be wonderful, darling.  

Quite frankly, I don't need any additional men of an advanced reproductive age coming into my country, taking the job which could be given to British men, particularly when an AI could do it anyway. You are kindly invited to go back to the United States.  

We also don't need your foreign religion here; we did kick you out of Europe for a reason.

-
they received less PPE
-They were more prepared to go to the sickest People at the most risk, but also, positioned most likely in these areas and this coverage, because in general black and Asian doctors in this country, are more likely to give provision to deprived areas in this country then white doctors are
- This is not just to do with the qualities or the opportunities of the doctors of colour, but also to do with the choice of white doctors to not give healthcare to deprived white areas
- And also: there are recognised immune classes on the base of ethnicity, and when research is driven away from what will actually deliver tailored Care, to absolute fucking bullshit like whether or not a fucking horse drug is something you should buy five times the amount of and eat it like it's for breakfast,.... maybe just maybe our research funding should not be dictated by the emotions of white people, but by actual evidence based need, including an extending that to areas of research where white people don't materially benefit because it just ain't relevant to them
- Furthermore: I WILL DI ON THE HILL PF EXPLAINING PULSE OX TO EVERYBOSY

do you wanna know what's really telling?  

Every time I get very specific about where particular sign off has to be, in conjunction with pointing out that there was a deliberate attempt to undermine a serving British army officer (part-time though he may be, lazy bastard), and when I raised this through channels where I might actually be listening to it if I'm taken seriously... do you know what's really interesting?  

Someone keeps flagging it to Mental Health rather than saying hey do you want to show us the email you got? Do you wanna show us what you're getting on your device?  

We already know there's a huge cyber security issues across this country, and in the areas that I'm talking about, literally from foreign adversaries according to your own documentation you think it's China.  

No, I ain't saying it is or isn't China, I'm actually saying that you keep saying it it's China, but you're not actually even looking at what I'm saying is a cyber security issue, you just keep referring it to Mental Health because I'm a woman so I can't understand how like code works.  

And I appreciate, I don't really fucking understand half of code because why?  

It's not because I'm a girl, it's cause I'm too fucking lazy to learn code.  

I understand the basic principles, I understand the logic system that it's built into, I understand the math mathematics that it runs off, I understand how it picks up linguistics, but do you know what I don't really know in any detail which I have to really tip my heart off to everybody who does? I don't actually write code. It's not because I don't know because I'm a girl, it's literally because I'm too fucking lazy, and the kind of courses that cater to my type of laziness are expensive.  

The thing that works out in my favourite this time colour is that it's very obvious from the tone of voice that duty... is not convinced 🤣🤣🤣🤣.  

So thanks for the last time that you called me a fucking psycho, and I actually got a psychosis review. That was totally the best use of NHS resources when it's very clear that what I have this PTSD and I had a huge list of stresses that would make a worsening of those symptoms really obvious, but all we really decided to do is talk about psychosis and not about the fact that I've never had trauma care or that it's really stressful that my rape case is doxxed (actually, I have to give it off to my psychiatrist, I did say that a lot, but I think however the psychosis element concern have been worded to him, just didn't think that was the priority in that moment with the amount of time that he had, which is not an unfair clinical position to take by the way, because untreated psychosis is such a big thing, so you can't risk leaving that bit untreated).  

I don't know who was informing the information chain there, but....  

Whoever is informing the information now, regardless of if it's the same person or a different person, it clearly isn't having the same impact.  
Because in both cases I'm effectively getting punished for raising a concern through the appropriate governance apparatus, and then getting stressed out enough and pissed off enough that I don't sound very convincing anymore, because I'm getting mixed up in no nonsense I don't even need to, again because I'm really fucking stressed about it...  

And even if that punishment is just a factor of the system, don't you think we want to change the fact of the system the factor issues a response that essentially punishes concern-raising?  

Anyway, I just think it's really interesting that instead of actually taking any serious action to potentially prevent the very clear data security issue, or to assist in the protection of current serving military regardless of who they are, what we've done in both cases is run to load a woman reporting, with quite serious psychological complaints.  

If we were doing this in a sensible way what you would do, if you genuinely had a concern that she's just battered, is that you would run a parallel safeguarding complaint to my trust, as well as also escalating the cyber security concern.  

But as in both cases, no one is actually wanting to talk about the text of the email, I don't actually think the second bit is being done.  

So here it is. I receive this in December 2022, and I received it around the same time that a book significantly tanked by an author.  

I think we should look at the event that that time and date is pointing to, and the fact that I would've been on university of Nottingham Wi-Fi at that time.  

And yes, I was a medical student who was also doing underdeclared survival sex work.  

I was doing that survival sex work because I was cornered into the position that a lot of people, predominantly women and queer people, quarantined into on a regular basis.  

And rather than abandoned my service to you with the general public of the United Kingdom and your healthcare, I decided that I would put myself through something that was inherently re-traumatising to me, because that would get me through the last tiny bit of my degree.  

I was doing this whilst not having the equality act provisions in place dedicated towards a physical disability, so to be honest, to me, and I was also going through the right case at the same time to my father as a child, the fact that I was prepared to go through all of that fucking trauma, for the people of this country and their healthcare, whilst also serving in the Covid pandemic as a doctor's assistant, and therefore putting myself at risk of Death?  

Do you know what, call me a slag but I was prepared to die for you to live.

Arguably, that's a lot more than the guys who are sitting in power now.  

So here is what is apparently from someone, that I can guarantee this is not how that man would've written this even if it was 100% his intention.  

It wouldn't be how you write it in a pressure it would not be how you write it in distress. It would not be how he wrote it when he was drunk or High, this is just not that person.  

And I think, if you know that person, you can have a very fucking good life at the fact that this was supposed to be passable:  

> "Dear Mistress,
> Hope this email finds you in the best of health.
> I am a relative newbie 38 year old asian male looking to explore my kinks.
> I am after a session incorporating OK spanking, mild nipple play, Bondage and anal strapon play. Also whispering into the ear whilst blindfolded and running nails sensually on my body is a particular scenario l would like to explore if possible.
> Would also like to worship the mistress.
> I am into boob , thigh and pussy worship at mistress's discretion.
> New to this so will require instructions on how I am doing.
> I will not like to be marked and don't like anything going in my mouth. Also not a fan of needles or hard domination.
> I suffer from an ailment which is I am very excitable and prematurely ejaculate. Hope this won't be a hindrance in the session and mistress will choose to ignore this and carry on with the session.
> What are your tributes for 60 and 90 mins? and is such a session possible.
> What is your availability like for Wednesday Morning 7th December.
> Looking forward to hear from you.
> Kind regards,
> YoYO

if you ask me, that sounds a lot more like somebody stitching their colleague got who's gonna go and speak at something that day, and at the university of Nottingham, there is a policing encounter terrorism event that happens on that day at the other side of the time.  

So is everyone in government? I keep trying to reach out to is either taking it on board but doing it quietly, or actively trying to re-refer this to psych, there you go, it's nice essentially off my dashboard.  

I tried to do this really nicely, and I tried to do this by never pushing this online, because I just don't fucking think that it's that person.  

I know a lot of men have shit that goes on in their head that they don't say out loud; I have now done sex work, and I can say that that is not what I would expect, as someone who has been a professional whore, from someone who presents themselves like that in public. Therefore, regardless of how much effort has gone into it, I just don't think that this guy would name himself after an Indian rapper. (yes the email address name was particularly racist. 🤣🤣🤣 bc that's of course what people do. Especially when the dude is not Indian. bro is british pakistani; different country innit)  

but of course, a blonde hair blue eyed Jewish girl, she's never gonna defend a brown British Pakistani guy is she?  

Specially if she's ever been raped before.  

Can I ask that whoever is involved in fucking around behind the scenes about this, that you take your racist arse out of my fucking emails?  

thx.  

also, "ailment"?  

bro aint in his 70s, guys. do better.  
I mean, apparently we're willing to give this guy the kudos of subjecting himself to all of that and then being able to walk in and give a talk like nothing happened, when that isn't even apparently within his realm of normality? I mean you've ascribed a lot of courage there well done. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  

this is also why I'm always like, the impersonation always kind of semi fancies the guy? It's so weird.  

i'll be honest my head hurts, and a lot of my device capacity is a bit weird right now, so I haven't represented how it's actually structured when you see it on an email, but there's bits that look like they're copied and pasted into other bits, and the whole thing when you look at it just looks like the most obvious stitch up of somebody at work, but only if you're having like a little list of people you were gonna stitch up at work, and so you do one of these to several different people.  

And given it that's what it looks like, I just think it's very interesting that when I happen to see some of the people who are also having very strange algorithmic experiences now, and I recognise people who are working in that same industry at that time, I just think it's really interesting that that looks like it was something that was done to a cluster of people.  

but as we all know, one who getting murdered is never really a story, it's only when you lose like all of your horses in an area, than anybody pays any fucking attention.  

But what's really weird for me? Is that you guys don't really seem bothered when it's one of your own military that is being attempted to get stitched up. When you keep going on about China and Russia being a huge cyber security threatened the last six months, which is so happens to be since I first tried to raise this and got this psych flag rather than actually getting a response, I just don't think you're being really that serious about the cyber security threat if you don't think this would be a very obvious and easy, low effort and low tech way to do it.  

The fact that you don't protect men with shiny bits at this point is the big red flag.  

Unless you're happy for the American fascist to be taking over, and having their own little annexation of the UK. I don't know why you would want to do that if you weren't really into fucking kids, because apparently that is basically the only group of people that they protect.  

if it wasn't for the international paedophile but, I probably too would decide to go into the international child sex trafficking just some protection alone; it does really feel like if you're in the Epstein files and you're actually a perpetrator, you're the safest fucking person alive right now.
