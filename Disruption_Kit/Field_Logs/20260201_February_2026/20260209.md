Pinging between Rockefeller and BirdTok for whatever reason.

[The media are desperate for bodies, jeez.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTBxUC/) Robbie Gibb has caught the scent. Maybe handover some of Jimmy Savile's protectors and profiteers, yes? Full cleaning of the house. Seeing as we are so keen.  

Because it's about VAWG, and not just partisan politics, right?  

[I mean, the questions are just so leading.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTSLHA/)  

This is why it was so reassuring to see Zack Polanski be so quick with the media.  

We really are in a world where, like in the 20s and 30s, the liberal media lacks the capacity to adequately question fascists.  

I had so much "calm down", "don't overexert yourself, after the "lobbying killed the radio star" node.  
Fascists are so silly. It's why we should laugh at them a lot more.  

Trust me. All abusers can be mocked. They are always pathetic worms, in love with any mirror they can see themselves in. No practical skills between them, and the definition of delicate if you ever mention their insecurities.  

What is Nigel's plan for Russia? Does he not care about Ukranian sovereignity? What about how he would stand up to CCP? Or is his plan mostly to slime over the pond to see his pedo bestie who looks like a satsuma farted?   

[I think the hate-reading is why I get stuff like this.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTSnYY/) Ngl, looked for pupil diameter. It's just men given a microphone. Does weird things to them.

[And this is why every normal person in this country is on tenderhooks. Because we actually give a shit about our kids, yeah?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTShF5/) Normal human behaviour.  

When Nigel Farage is silent on Epstein, and Matt Goodwin is proposing punishment for failure to breed?  

A lot of us can hear *exactly* what they are saying.  

And it doesn't protect *any* of our children.  

No pasaran. Not ever.

It's also just hit why liberal media pundits don't think a man whose fists are shaking, but is choosing to hold onto a desk, is anything but weakness.  
You've never done our class's jobs.  

That wasn't a man that was nervous; that was a man who was choosing not to punch a wall.  

I'll take the men who are angry about injustice and can still contain their emotions, thanks.  

I don't think we get to find out until after the police conclude, but I hadn't realised a lot of you have not done the sort of jobs where people occaisionally want to punch you in the face.  

That is a man who is very upset and is choosing to be an adult. Honestly, that might be a bit of a turn up for the books in the UK. Usually, they remain unbothered. That's why the Truss comparison seemed weird.  

Please remember most people in your audience have a different life and occupational exposure to you, in media and policy. It explains a lot of the times the read feels "off" to us.  

You didn't really need whatever AI middleware we are stuck in; you just needed to listen to people and understand their lives.  

The whole thing is quite dehumanising for us all, really.

I appreciate I said I wasn't going to share any emotional responses.  

This is an exception because it's this insulting, which quite frankly I think will still be celebrated by the person who's done it.  

Can Robert Jenrick stop making everything about him?  

We are talking about an international child sex trafficking ring with extensive financial arrangements which appear to be in the realm of money laundering and corruption, which impact all parties including his by the way, and with extensive interference in UK politics across all sides of the house, including his own party. As usual, Robert Jenrick needs to make it about him.  

Kemi wasn't wrong: the trash took itself out when Jenrick defected to Reform UK.  

why the fuck would anyone want a general election **before** Nigel Farage explains why he was so connected to Jeffrey Epstein's network?  

Is there anything that Reform UK would like to share with us?  

don't worry, I appreciate everyone thinks survivors are very fragile, I've seen the worst of the Epstein files content. I am not surprised. I've been watching a genocide live for three years (something that Mr Jenrick was also very happy to support, as was Epstein's network). I cannot be shocked anymore.  

Whoever thought traumatising the entire population was a good idea, it was a fucking idiot.  

Some of us, don't fold.  
Some of us, become even more formidable.

I'm hit something in MOD/ATC London/Cranwell in 2014/5/6, and I think I know who.  

Gosh. It really is a very silly little boys' club, isn't it?

The number of very silly but dangerous men I have been put in front of through my adult life is unfortunate.  

One looks at that sort of run and sometimes has to ask if my data kept getting... caught.  

Not even sure what one would call that...  

Paedo probe? Noncometer?  

The next person to comment on the "baby face" in those terms? Off the plank.  

We spend our lives being forced to toughen up, and you wonder why the only men who stand a chance of handling us are those who are prepared to face women whilst completely disarmed.  

So what do we get in the Midlands? That's a particular transfer. Why does UoN only want to release an academic record for Derby, and not give an entire SAR in compliance with the law? There's a system that they appear to be hedging around, and it appears to be administrative for 2016 to 2019, and they still can't answer twin profiles or R&D.

[Because the Kibbutz Boy and the Nonces' Bestie are both up the trousers of the press at all times and its a workers' party and can't buy the press.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy8e9Qb/) You all know this. Sky's bosses want to hand over their harddrives?  

Dw I know they're desperate to get the Nazis in, so could just be that.  

Farage was more in bed with this lot than the PM. Ask him what he knows.  

[It's individual citizens in the demos who are doing the work on this story. You lot are barely touching it.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy88YkK/)  

The cash that was around Mandelson is the same cash that is around Farage. Wake the fuck up.

[Fabulous Freudian slip. Love it.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy8Uq1c/)  

[I'm not endorsing violence but I am saying I get the anger. Who doesn't?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRyRo5R9/)  

I don't believe for a second that all of these men are genuinely shocked. I think that they are scared that this is what we will do.  

I only wish they had thought about that **before** abusing children.  

[We could make this aboit Russia, our fav to hate, if we really wanted to.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy8mM1N/) Why are all the really far right people so quiet? This is your golden opportunity to prove to the younger generations why they should be going to war for you. Why are you so quiet?  
Is that how bad the evidence is?
