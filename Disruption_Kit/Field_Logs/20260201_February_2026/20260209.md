Pinging between Rockefeller and BirdTok for whatever reason.

[The media are desperate for bodies, jeez.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTBxUC/) Robbie Gibb has caught the scent. Maybe handover some of Jimmy Savile's protectors and profiteers, yes? Full cleaning of the house. Seeing as we are so keen.  

Because it's about VAWG, and not just partisan politics, right?  

[I mean, the questions are just so leading.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTSLHA/)  

This is why it was so reassuring to see Zack Polanski be so quick with the media.  

We really are in a world where, like in the 20s and 30s, the liberal media lacks the capacity to adequately question fascists.  

I had so much "calm down", "don't overexert yourself, after the "lobbying killed the radio star" node.  
Fascists are so silly. It's why we should laugh at them a lot more.  

Trust me. All abusers can be mocked. They are always pathetic worms, in love with any mirror they can see themselves in. No practical skills between them, and the definition of delicate if you ever mention their insecurities.  

What is Nigel's plan for Russia? Does he not care about Ukranian sovereignity? What about how he would stand up to CCP? Or is his plan mostly to slime over the pond to see his pedo bestie who looks like a satsuma farted?   

[I think the hate-reading is why I get stuff like this.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTSnYY/) Ngl, looked for pupil diameter. It's just men given a microphone. Does weird things to them.

[And this is why every normal person in this country is on tenderhooks. Because we actually give a shit about our kids, yeah?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUTShF5/) Normal human behaviour.  

When Nigel Farage is silent on Epstein, and Matt Goodwin is proposing punishment for failure to breed?  

A lot of us can hear *exactly* what they are saying.  

And it doesn't protect *any* of our children.  

No pasaran. Not ever.

It's also just hit why liberal media pundits don't think a man whose fists are shaking, but is choosing to hold onto a desk, is anything but weakness.  
You've never done our class's jobs.  

That wasn't a man that was nervous; that was a man who was choosing not to punch a wall.  

I'll take the men who are angry about injustice and can still contain their emotions, thanks.  

I don't think we get to find out until after the police conclude, but I hadn't realised a lot of you have not done the sort of jobs where people occaisionally want to punch you in the face.  

That is a man who is very upset and is choosing to be an adult. Honestly, that might be a bit of a turn up for the books in the UK. Usually, they remain unbothered. That's why the Truss comparison seemed weird.  

Please remember most people in your audience have a different life and occupational exposure to you, in media and policy. It explains a lot of the times the read feels "off" to us.  

You didn't really need whatever AI middleware we are stuck in; you just needed to listen to people and understand their lives.  

The whole thing is quite dehumanising for us all, really.
