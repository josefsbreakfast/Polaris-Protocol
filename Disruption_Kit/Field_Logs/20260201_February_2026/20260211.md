The book has sections that appear to be different men having their own little chunter about whatever their pet issue is.  

This is why think tanks shouldn't exist; they start to think they are not mere satsumas, bobbing around a little bucket of unregulated cortisol and testosterone.

In addition, according to a highly questionable bibliography, Carl Schmitt was publishing 22 years after his death; now I have Zombie Nazis to worry about.  

The inconsistency in url endings also boils my blood, academically. Lack of appropriate capitalisations, double soaces, double punctuation marks. It goes on.  

I mean, I'll be honest, I still find Polaris mortifying; this is making me feel genuinely better about my own inadequacies.  

Not being able to spell a short word in someone's own discipline also seems... unusual.  

This book is very insulting to several relationships we rely on for trade.

Oh, I know who this is. Silly gooses.  

This is the Hamas-Knitting-Circle crew.  

You are weirdly scared of China.  

And women, apparantly.  

I'm afraid my vote is for you off the island. This... this was weird.  

Glad to have wasted your money; cannot wait to sue. Liked your little fumble over AI regs. Very sweet.  

But you have ripped off all my work here and written it badly with frequent errors. I don't like it.

[Yes; that is me. You are correct.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy5VbNg/)  

Few questions:  

1. Does this count as defeating the final boss level of Canary mission?

2. You don't have me on the website, and I've never been antisemite of the year, do I get a medal? (Do I instead qualify as Semite of the year?) I was actually quite upset, given... *everything*.  

3. Alternatively, I am happy to go around as Queen Esther on Purim, and make so much noise in your general direction. I will require a crown.

4. Is this essentially largely part because you could never screen capture something that was really obvious, so you couldn't really make me look antisemitic per se? Like, in all due respect I have given in some case of slides or tables of pointers.

5. Are you thinking maybe holding an actual ceasefire, halting annexation, and maybe just calming tf down for a second, could possibly be an option?  

I hope you do all realise, that there is a bit of a joke here and how much you've probably spent on this; if you'd just let me do my little BDS thing, it would've saved you money and you wouldn't have expanded all the resources you've been using for other actions, but obviously I'm quite happy about that. Glad to know I ate up some of those funds. We probably do need to like... stop doing the genocide bit.

[You know when you guys do stuff like this?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy54Th7/)  

So I don't want to belittle the harm that it causes, because I only don't have any more emotions other than to laugh at you because I am so far past the ability to give a shit about having any dignity any more, but...  

Do you realise that it feels like the apartheid is actively taking death rattle gasps?  

Do you realise that this makes it look like the state is moribund?  

I'm just not clear if you do, and if you don't, that is how it's reading.  

In what I assume will be the most complicated set of arrangements ever, Jewish people are always Jewish and will always all part of kol Yisrael.  

So, you ain't gettin' rid of me that quick; I will be intending to be your problem for a very long time to come.  

Family, innit.  

(The white guys might have to sit down and learn how to be antifascist; some very questionable beliefs about the Holocaust in that crowd, so we might need to go over some shit. I am anti-every-genocide; pikuach nefesh for everyone, baby.)

So...  

What was the deal with the book?  

Is this like that weird CSE paper? Or is this supposed to be "punishment"?  

I'm not really sure I get the point?  

This feels like very sloppy symbolism, and I still can't get over how much of it was AI slop.  

I find it very interesting that I'm essentially facing down all of the "greatest minds" in tech, and none of you have the balls to be honest about what you know, or that Defence (or whichever particular Ministerial etc joke sold the thing), can't just say, "hey, we messed up, actually".  

It's very disappointing.  

I used to feel like integrety was a lot more common than this. Perhaps I wasn't always right about that. I would like us to be able to practice this more. I think it would make a nicer world to be alive in.  

Until then, I suppose we're waiting out the algorithmic impact of training core AI tooling on my voice.  

I might start writing nodes about medicine. Just for the fun of the thing; humanities is not really my area of expertise.

I've actually slept most of today because I feel a bit rotten, but:  

There's a number of practically forensic sentences in this book, and several paragraphs, that... strongly indicate who is in this boys club.  

There are so many rants that so many of you clearly couldn't help going on.  

I want to say it's kind of cute, but I feel like that distracts from all of the rest of the other bullshit that's happened.  

For the record, I mean cute in the diminutive, like a child, way. Not, "this is attractive to me".  

something that I think a number of you might be fixating on, and this might be why you're finding some of the social changes of the last 10 to 20 years a little tricky, it's also something that it takes an amount of time to do the transformative learning around, but it might help you be happier people in the long run if you can manage it. You've been told all your lives that it's about the amount of knowledge that you bring, or the ferocity of your opinions. I'm not trying to diminish the times in which being good at those things has helped you personally. However, this does sometimes seem like a little bit of a teenage psychosexual drama, where you are cross about your perceived worth as men, and you seem quite frustrated that something that you're proud of, or something you feel you're good at, it doesn't translate into being in the latest teenage heartthrob. The reason that I often refer to this is a like to rocking behaviour with dear, is because that's what it looks like to women: it looks like you're trying to impress other men, not us. Like most folk humans, women are looking for someone who checks a list, with debate skills at the top. That's not really women's fault, that's just the fact that we are human beings and we are mammalian; whilst many women will find that attractive to some degree, that can't really be the entirety of that person's biological assessment, and that's probably what you're picking up on is that you don't feel but it's putting you into an approval rating that you want. Now there's two ways we can go from this. Firstly, human beings are more than their sexual worth to others. i'm not saying that sex isn't an important part of being a human, I'm saying that you're worth as a person is not dependent on your sexual work, regardless of how much that has been taught in a cultural manner. The reason that we cling onto that in the system that we are in, is that it makes men work harder, to the extent where in countries like China in Japan it's actually not unusual for men to die of sudden cardiac events in the 40s because they've worked so hard (in other words, far before genetics or age should kick in as serious risk factors). we can also point the crisis that we have in suicide for men; whilst there are some factors that we probably can't change long-term, the fact that men can't express their emotions through but a very narrow range of activities, is extremely damaging to male mental health. Furthermore, a lot of the women who are advocating for harm reduction and violence on our own size, are very aware of what this will take; a lot of us are very aware that men do not have healthy coping responses, do not get taught healthy coping responses, often see themselves as needing to solve every problem, and these are significant drivers of violence, *in addition to* the way in which they taught to view women and children. It is possible to understand someone's bad behaviour, without condoning it. Likewise, men are adults the last time I checked, and that does give you a responsibility to start taking accountability yourselves. This is all to say, there are a number of incredibly stressful and harmful demands that men are under on a cultural and societal basis, which drastically increases the risk of violence to everyone else, as well as to other men. Furthermore, many of these are cultural conditions, and are not necessary, or are not biologically mandated. Even if they were, we can change our culture so that the demands change. Unfortunately, if you've done very well in this system this does mean that giving up power relative to where you were, is a necessity for a quality, and this will feel threatening, due to the very conditions that are currently in place. This includes giving up power relative to other men who are more oppressed than you are. This includes giving up power to men that you've made not feel are as good as you are. However, in the long run, the system which we have which puts manner such heightened competition with each other, is doing so on values which are not necessarily relevant to that happiness, completely divorced from how relationship relationships pan out in humans in general, and is therefore ultimately not making many of these men are very happy, even when they are winning at that system. Unfortunately, filling the void, is actually quite tricky work, but it can absolutely be done. There will be quick wins, but there is no instantaneous fix, for what a decades, centuries, millennia, of cultural norms.  

Being in permanent competition with each other, the self, and society, is ultimately not making many men very happy. The apparant widespread need to use exogenous drugs to improve mood, regardless of whether these fall under medical antidepressants, or whether they are psychedelics or euphoric agents purchased separate separately, is reasonably good evidence that in some cases these are not meeting what would always be a state that someone has to address medically, but our attempting to compensate for a society lack, which is translating to a generalised lack of neurotransmitter production, maintenance, and uptake.  

If the richest man in the world are needing to take this many drugs, are riches making them happy? Probably not.  

Humans have a long history of taking things that make them feel funny, as too many animals. I'm not really coming down with an opinion on taking exogenous substances to produce a chemical effect. What I'm saying, is when that becomes very normalised, which I did our financial services in the 70s and 80s, and it very much has become very normal in a generation that was raised in the 50s and 60s, and this is soon as part of the acquisition of capitalism, which is promoted in men, are the men actually happy? I would imagine not, at baseline. I appreciate that many of them have a catastrophic adverse reaction to the word "feminism", and say titration must be very  considered, so it's not to produce a life-threatening reaction (as much for the healer, as for the patient). It ought to be noted that within this process, there is also the complexity of accountability for addressing justice issues; the patient may require specialist support, and there should be monitored and revisit it over the course of management.  

I am very aware that regardless of who else I write for, there are selection of men who take great interest in what I am writing, you are more in the Socratic questioning point of the process. They have not decided whether or not they really would like to engage in change, and I'm not judging anything else that's going on with them in their lives when I say that, in that regard, it does not bother me as a writer to write for that audience. I can't forgive you for other people, if that's what you're here for, you won't be getting it from me. However, in terms of answering the question of why this whole escapade bothers you so much, and why you are so deeply unhappy at your core, why you feel no attached to other humans, and why this is really been very disappointing despite your success – this much, I can tolerate writing for, and it is rather an interesting subject when you get into it, I feel.  
It would've been a lot easier if so, many of you were not so scared of the late Mark Fisher.  

I will fear that my capacity and humanities, is nowhere close to Professor Fisher's, or his beloved colleagues; I would encourage you to read them separately.  

But if you need them translated into, "as a science nerd, this is what I found really interesting, and this is what it made me think of", then sure: welcome to the journal club.  

Bring good biscuits. Yes I do judge.

(See? that felt a lot of space, met a word count, and it still managed to make any fucking sense! This is why putting your slack conversations into an LLM did not work the same way as actually paying somebody for a book. Stop trying to make AI books happen. You're all so fucking weird, sometimes.)  

The process of creation is actually something that we can't or don't have the neuroscience to properly fully define; it is in part of very animal process, and we're not very good at fully understanding what it is. I'm reading the Syllabus book (Lynda Barry) in chunks and it's very good.

"If the thing we call 'the arts' had a biological function: what would it be? And where would it be?"  

Honestly, I feel that these are too very complicated questions. That was on page 15.
