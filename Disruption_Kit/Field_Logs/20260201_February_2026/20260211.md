The book has sections that appear to be different men having their own little chunter about whatever their pet issue is.  

This is why think tanks shouldn't exist; they start to think they are not mere satsumas, bobbing around a little bucket of unregulated cortisol and testosterone.

In addition, according to a highly questionable bibliography, Carl Schmitt was publishing 22 years after his death; now I have Zombie Nazis to worry about.  

The inconsistency in url endings also boils my blood, academically. Lack of appropriate capitalisations, double soaces, double punctuation marks. It goes on.  

I mean, I'll be honest, I still find Polaris mortifying; this is making me feel genuinely better about my own inadequacies.  

Not being able to spell a short word in someone's own discipline also seems... unusual.  

This book is very insulting to several relationships we rely on for trade.

Oh, I know who this is. Silly gooses.  

This is the Hamas-Knitting-Circle crew.  

You are weirdly scared of China.  

And women, apparantly.  

I'm afraid my vote is for you off the island. This... this was weird.  

Glad to have wasted your money; cannot wait to sue. Liked your little fumble over AI regs. Very sweet.  

But you have ripped off all my work here and written it badly with frequent errors. I don't like it.

[Yes; that is me. You are correct.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy5VbNg/)  

Few questions:  

1. Does this count as defeating the final boss level of Canary mission?

2. You don't have me on the website, and I've never been antisemite of the year, do I get a medal? (Do I instead qualify as Semite of the year?) I was actually quite upset, given... *everything*.  

3. Alternatively, I am happy to go around as Queen Esther on Purim, and make so much noise in your general direction. I will require a crown.

4. Is this essentially largely part because you could never screen capture something that was really obvious, so you couldn't really make me look antisemitic per se? Like, in all due respect I have given in some case of slides or tables of pointers.

5. Are you thinking maybe holding an actual ceasefire, halting annexation, and maybe just calming tf down for a second, could possibly be an option?  

I hope you do all realise, that there is a bit of a joke here and how much you've probably spent on this; if you'd just let me do my little BDS thing, it would've saved you money and you wouldn't have expanded all the resources you've been using for other actions, but obviously I'm quite happy about that. Glad to know I ate up some of those funds. We probably do need to like... stop doing the genocide bit.

[You know when you guys do stuff like this?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy54Th7/)  

So I don't want to belittle the harm that it causes, because I only don't have any more emotions other than to laugh at you because I am so far past the ability to give a shit about having any dignity any more, but...  

Do you realise that it feels like the apartheid is actively taking death rattle gasps?  

Do you realise that this makes it look like the state is moribund?  

I'm just not clear if you do, and if you don't, that is how it's reading.  

In what I assume will be the most complicated set of arrangements ever, Jewish people are always Jewish and will always all part of kol Yisrael.  

So, you ain't gettin' rid of me that quick; I will be intending to be your problem for a very long time to come.  

Family, innit.  

(The white guys might have to sit down and learn how to be antifascist; some very questionable beliefs about the Holocaust in that crowd, so we might need to go over some shit. I am anti-every-genocide; pikuach nefesh for everyone, baby.)
