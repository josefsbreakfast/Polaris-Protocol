Narrowed down when and how Elbit received, and why it was taken into private, as well as where the whistleblow would have happened. I know why they cannot find under legal name.  

Which means I've likely hit some judicary.  

How can you condemn one and yet carry the sin?  

I also know why 2011 was nudged, as a contrast.  

So I can limit my case, not entirely, but in large part, to one colour of rosette.  

You broke everything.  

You broke my entire life as soon as I became more confident.  

You are not better than my biological father; you're worse.

This is Blairite.  

This is why that SAR got so much backlash in data terms.  

You have stripped me of a childhood and an adulthood. You have hurt, deeply, everyone who even smiles at me as they pass.  

If you don't submit to Feb 23 (because I'm assuming you're lawyering; it looks this way), I will still force discovery.  

I don't need a lawyer, when you made me the "sentiment and tone adjustment" for a nation.  

I just need to write like I did in August and September.  

The demos is not stupid; this would not surprise a soul.

Sometimes, the total is only possible if one nexus is lying and omitting to many parties; I am not unaware that sonetimes, all it takes is to be ill-informed, for someone to dehumanise.  

It was well documented in the first disclosurs of the degree of criminality at Guantanimo Bay.  

People can be confinved to "go further" by specific briefs.  

Look at the pipeline of lawyers to politics on that one. You'll see the pattern, especially if you look at how they speak.  

Words are power.

I think this was noticed in 2014 - 2016 era.  

I think I know how it was noticed, and it is slightly making me uneasy, but that's okay.
