Narrowed down when and how Elbit received, and why it was taken into private, as well as where the whistleblow would have happened. I know why they cannot find under legal name.  

Which means I've likely hit some judicary.  

How can you condemn one and yet carry the sin?  

I also know why 2011 was nudged, as a contrast.  

So I can limit my case, not entirely, but in large part, to one colour of rosette.  

You broke everything.  

You broke my entire life as soon as I became more confident.  

You are not better than my biological father; you're worse.

This is Blairite.  

This is why that SAR got so much backlash in data terms.  

You have stripped me of a childhood and an adulthood. You have hurt, deeply, everyone who even smiles at me as they pass.  

If you don't submit to Feb 23 (because I'm assuming you're lawyering; it looks this way), I will still force discovery.  

I don't need a lawyer, when you made me the "sentiment and tone adjustment" for a nation.  

I just need to write like I did in August and September.  

The demos is not stupid; this would not surprise a soul.

Sometimes, the total is only possible if one nexus is lying and omitting to many parties; I am not unaware that sonetimes, all it takes is to be ill-informed, for someone to dehumanise.  

It was well documented in the first disclosurs of the degree of criminality at Guantanimo Bay.  

People can be confinved to "go further" by specific briefs.  

Look at the pipeline of lawyers to politics on that one. You'll see the pattern, especially if you look at how they speak.  

Words are power.

I think this was noticed in 2014 - 2016 era.  

I think I know how it was noticed, and it is slightly making me uneasy, but that's okay.

Feed is strongly mirroring male concern, attempting to push/pull on narratives, mainly to "stop".  

It tells this largely through romance tropes, which makes the same men sound even more ridiculous.  

I don't suddenly need to furnish a studio flat, so.. 🤷‍♀️  

One woman in this circle is making the sensible choice; Melinda's interview is refreshing, may help.

(Your wife always outshone you. Quite odd the papers were always so cruel, especially given the "Prince" could have sorted that.)  

[15. Some without any evidence, not a jot, and they have survived several decades of CIDT.](https://icct.nl/publication/snapshot-guantanamo-bay)  

It's a pattern of behaviour, at this point.  

The man at the top just hasn't emotionally caught up, it seems.  

Probably because he was so deliberately picked, placed, and boxed in.  

Just as brought in CPS data reforms which would have made the pattern of grooming networks in this country legiable to the law.  

We still do not have public detail of these contracts. This was Epstein's area of business investment at that time.

My grandfather wasn't wrong: you are a fascist.  

"Board of Peace", when you helped destroy it?  

It's genocide. And I know that you know that it is.  

See you at The Hague.

I was brought back a year early, in advance of Oct 07, after the Judicial Reform Crisis.  

To no one's surprise at all: he's more of a Likud asset than a British one. Who could possibly foresee that one.  

Given the involvement in what is, notionally, an Israeli arms company (Elbit UK) and LFI, and the involvement in Midlands policing and academia, this is not safe for national security and does not seek to benefit the British Isles.  

I told you all: it doesn't have to be the big man at the top. It just needed to be someone he implicitally trusts.  

If we look at which voices are calling for resignation, this would indicate an assumed greater risk to those who are more evidentially connected, if he stayed.  

Therefore: I remain agnostic regarding both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. All things considered, this may be a more stable pairing, if we do not simply wish to just burn the whole system down. Given the advance of the other Epstein asset and his racism and misogyny, I would prefer we didn't get the turquoise tortoises elected.  

So: Who was the sentiment analysis dataset for Jewish female rape survivors in the UK?  

Perhaps Mr Blair or Mr Mandelson might be able to tell us.  

Colonialism in working class parties is not progressive. It is infiltration.  

This does all shed light, additionally, on why Reform were around 24-48 hours ahead of Labour on policy, and yet the latter appeared to have the thing fleshed out.  

[It's giving "you duplicitous little shit".](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUFfDgX/)  

But, perhaps, in plural.  

Starmer is just being treated as another Brown, with greater leverage from assumed seniority.

Shall we rethink that 6 month SLAPP?  

Do you know what should allow safeguarding and civil rights to override this, not only for myself, but several others?  

[Do you remember signing this one? Minor piece of legislation. Easily forgettable, I suppose.](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents)

This also indicates overseas operation on UK soil is targeted to 2015/6 and... not necessarily Russia or China.  

Not the one I'm thinking of.  

I guess something in the shellfish actually works pretty well on many levels, and you wouldn't materially notice the other alterations.  

Great respect for veterans, this one.  
Good to know you just need a few of the right ears at Oxford. Highly reassuring.  

[I suppose that answers that, in the public domain.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4825524.stm)

Are you going to stop DDoSing me when I seek advice from lawyers, now?  

Have I given you enough to work with?  
Libel needs to be false and you will need to allow me a lawyer to have a case against me.  

I think a lawyer would be good.  

Letting me speak to my own Labour MP would also be acceptable, but given what is apoarently very normalised in the party, she will need to be strongly backed up by the non-nonce wing.  

(I was 15. I was a child. The MOD only stopped the records discussion as I brought up consent and The Children's Act.)
