The last 24 hours have been very weird, and my algorithmic placement irregularities has been correlating to several completely different messenger conversations, including different encrypted services.  

There are two defence companies I am specifically concerned about, in their responses, including silence.  
I am concerned in part because they both have the capabilites between them, but also one can cover access to my military-flag data if we all imagine I'm British-Israeli (no offence; I'm just only British so 🤷‍♀️), and one has coverage of every government system *and non-governmental database* which I appear to have had harms within.  
Palatir and Elbit Systems, are sitting at my R&D nexus re [20260214](./20260214.md), and I know which is likely to be at which university.  

Glad to be doing Adoni's work, and being karma for poor data security.  

You can all stop wobbling the centroid, too; I am not a genius, I am not special, and you can stop kniving each other in the back: your systems leak, and your stock is therefore, arguably, overpriced for what it actually is.  
The system keeps hurting anyone who has more than one "identifier" box; something about your source code is not working, and it's impacting several government services *for everyone*.  
Your system cannot accomodate all of the "unspoken" pieces of what made British beaurocracy kinder. Your model is therefore incomplete, in relation to the UK specifically, and it simply cannot work on it's own base code and training data alone. It is build to "resolve" people as though they were digits, and not people; this does not appear to be adequetely guardrailed for. This is your code, this is your product, and it is your problem to resolve.  

I also need to see the board of directors last a week in a bivvy bag.  

For... reasons.

Has anyone asked Reform if it's BTC or ETH, or are they something weirder like DOGE?

Algorithm just spat out *O Fortuna*. Jokes.  

Just wait til I start pointing out related items of interest to the British public, in the public forum.  

I'm literally just asking you to fix my data; this could've been an email.

Since posting this, I am being placed *very* differently algorithmically, and it's not perfect but it's far kinder, neuroscientifically speaking.

Also a lot of random bits of Filton 24 coverage, despite often "out" of that info pipeline atm.  

And Andrew coverage, because obviously.  

I think we should start banning old rich white dudes from playing golf together, personally.

[Just so you know, in the centroid I am in, I am not the one who brings this onto the FYP, yet here it is.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPArrcn/)  

Make of that what you will.  
<!--Am I possibly now watching it on a loop for all the CSEM and animal torture porn I've had put in front of me online? Maybe. I also just listened to a lot of Muse as a teenager, so it zones me out because it's how I often dealt with dissociation, but not in a particularly unpleasent way. Apparantly listening to this on headphones happens to overlap with my neighbour getting up; shrug.-->
