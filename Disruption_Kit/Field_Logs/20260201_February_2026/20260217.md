Further evidence that [my left is not weak](https://youtu.be/UM6wrV0VLL4?si=36jiXytBk0JiqW74).  

We are not always defined by Zionism, and unfortunately if the west only accept us when we are Zionists, but refuses us when we are like this, the West is still participating in the same antisemitism that led up to the holocaust; I don't care how many parades you go to average January.  

It matters more that you're not going to do it again, and respectfully: see Palestine, Sudan, Congo... there is a list, and it goes on, and until we don't have a list anymore, some of us will never forget what really caused that catastrophe, who the victims really were, and how it was really resisted against.  

I would rather die standing than live on my knees; the west isn't very good at those kind of Jews either.  

Antisemitism is the same that it's been for 100 years, they've just said that they'll give you a "whites' only" ticket, as long as you put your money and your political loyalty where they tell you to.  

I would rather die fighting, than live as a slave to a machine that gronds our souls. It looks.. uncomfortable, and unappealing.

[This is the level of "wtf black mirror thick of it crossover episode is this??", I need for this mess left somewhere near the left.](https://youtu.be/C2I8P6uNmJU?si=l4K-C72hZgXEOIun)  

"They investigate themselves, and it turns out that they're not guilty. Hey, Hey! Daloy Polizei! It means the same thing now as yesterday."  

I also want to pick up one of the quotations from the report, which is around Andrew Feinstein, and this really follows what I've been documenting for some time, which is that amongst other organisations and outfits, labour as a party, and in particular labour together, do you seem to engage with a lot of very antisemitic rhetoric as long as it is in their political interests to do so.  
Discussing a Jewish man, in Britain, as having a somewhat pathological mismatch between his faith and his politics, is antisemitism.  

i'm not going to explain at length right now, because I feel like I've explained it and explained it and explained it so many times recently, but this is a profound gathering of Jewish men, and if it's often done by white men after a Jewish man rejects something the white man wants to do whilst crawling it protection of Jewish people.  

This shows how white men in the labour party routinely engage in a very racist and very sexualised form of orientalised emasculation, of Jewish men. 

I have already given many examples of the discussion behind why that is so problematic and how very much it is rooted in Nazi ideology, how it drove the Holocaust, and also how it currently drives a large amount of Islamophobia today. I hope that you can reference what I've written about in the past.  

It is so saddening as a Jewish woman, to see a party that says it supports Jews, routinely find itself attached to disclosures like this, which suggest that actually there is some really rampant and very unaddressed racism, that a lot of that racism has a psychosexual component, and that the party would rather use that to bully men who are standing on the Jewish values, already a great risk, rather than engage with those men's politics.  
This is a century, at the current point, evidence that the labour party is at the very least unable to hold accountability to forms of antisemitism that it does not see or recognise, or that it does say and it does recognise, but a politically inconvenient to challenge, and for which there is a political incentive to leave unaddressed.  

this is what was mirrored and channelled through the language used towards Zack Polanski in a recent speech by Keir Starmer, and frankly that speech was very concerning for me, and I think for a lot of Jewish people, that clip was very scary. I think a lot of people would struggle to explain why that was, because the emotional undertone is quite indirect, but essentially the labour party called a Jewish man a foreigner, a Russian asset, and apparently did not understand how that microaggression is so dangerous.  

It doesn't matter if the labour party genuinely does not see any of this and it is not meaning to from the bottom of its heart, engage in this rhetoric: it **is** actively engaging in the rhetoric which preceded the Holocaust, and we're not even the chief group of derision this time, and it's *still* this bad.

[Some of the centroid is struggling with this concept.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfvQ4c3/)  

The general coverage today, is again just replicating along history of whatever you would be interested in if you were trying to push authoritarianism in the UK but also in Europe as well, I've had a lot of things about France today (and there is a particular reason, that I am not in control of, as to why that is).  

I'm going to imagine that this comes from a very particular life story and class background as well as a reasonably homogenous demographic in the space which looks at policy and political strategy. Unfortunately, because we have been so focused on KPI-style politics, but have not really moved to OKR-basis strategy, we are seeing a repeated cycle of "numbers chasing", which mortgages the future on the basis of today.  

(I just had such a weird error with dictation, slipping in something about council tax, where it's not vocally close. Cann anyone using software please be slightly more disciplined in their clipboard management? Thx.)  

That doesn't need to be this really long and complicated discussion about why people on voting for business orientated supposedly left parties; people are not voting for them because they're essential essentially useless to the general public.  

That's your entire answer.  

A little bit of compromise makes sense, but if you are constantly compromising the party values, and the once and wishes of the people doing the work daughter door on the ground for you, you are going to piss people off enough overtime, such to the point where they will no longer vote for you. They will particularly do this at times of great charity they will particularly do this if significant moral lines are very clearly overrun.  

there are some really clear things that could be done by the current Labour Party if they wish to increase popularity and cement stability; the labour party, for whatever reason, and this may be internal, and may be bad on the letters, it can be because they have been caught by contracting all by something within government contracts itself... but the current Labour Party cannot currently deliver the really easy things, and if that is the case, we need to look at how the state apparatus is stopping that from happening, as well as what in the labour party is stopping that from happening, because it's not actually clear that it's definitely in isolation labour party issue but it's also unclear that it's definitely an isolation a state issue.

[Saaaame.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfvafXt/)  

Before we get into the, "what if your heroes fall?", discourse: I was born in such a way that I was gendered as a female from birth, therefore a huge major majority of my heroes have shown themselves to be essentially useless throughout my life, I am more than happy to invest in a new set of heroes. They haven't fallen so far yet, but I don't have trust in them.  

People seem to act like trust is something that you can only ever have once, and once it's broken, it's broken forever. I have a diagnosis of complex PTSD, and within that diagnosis I inherently struggle to trust people and the world; I can tell you now that you can overcome the difficulties that you have with trust to at least a partial degree, even if it means that you will always inherently struggle to have that on an inherent level, if that's what is needed to maintain a civil society.  

It is not impossible to learn to love again after heartbreak, so why would it be impossible to learn to trust again, following a betrayal?  

Just because something is hard, does not mean it is impossible.

The idea of having to do this call back to duty psychiatry is already annoying to me; I know what it is that I keep touching in the governance portion of their story, which seems to generate a flag to that team. It means that I can't really discuss the issue with that team, because actually it's a very long windy story, and it does sound like complete bollocks that I'm making up, if I have to explain it in a short way. I think this is just going to be a situation that I have to be honest and say that there is a conflict of interest in information sharing (in other words, part of the governance under scrutiny, and very fairly under scrutiny because there are now deletions that you can see in what should be highly secure records, can potentially access those medical records at that place), and stick to the main point of whether or not I am in good health.  

I understand that to some degree, whether or not this is the intention, this acts are shaming technique. I'm going to repeat that I find it very interesting that whoever is doing this, does not want to do it in a way that is easily traceable, does not want to do it in a way that directly goes to the police, does not want to go through a legal route, does not want to issue a reaction notice, does not want to issue a season and desist, does not want to go through lawyers.  

They would rather use whatever network or information sharing device they're using, in order to go to Mental Health team, but also by doing so they are surrendering the information that they do know my exact healthcare team.  

That is profoundly odd.  

If I was in any of the organisations, or if I was any of the individuals that I've listed who are potential decision-making points, even if they have no idea who I am, if I was in their position, I wouldn't currently be acting to protect my own reputation, and I would be doing that by shutting down anyone who is perpetuating any of the issues.  

This is a very interesting moment of governance that I will not see right now, but will reveal itself over time; in a few months, it will be very possible to see who took responsibility at this point, who acted in a way that was preservative to their own image but was essentially legal and reasonable and ethical, who dealt with this in a way that fits the norms of British legal action, and who acted in a manner that is perhaps wanting when it comes to transparency, accountability, and democratic values.  

In other words, because I appreciate this is a trigger phrase for the counterterrorism and intelligence community: we will find out which ones of you held to your British values, and which of you are traitors to the state.  

Harsh? Yes, probably.  

Unfair? You just criminalised a group that was trying to enforce compliance of our own domestic laws which require compliance for the International Court of Justice. by doing so you have not only broken the law in this country, and find the Court orders that I've been issued by the ICJ, but you have also acted in a way that is counted as perpetrating the genocide in question, when that impacts Palestinians in particular, including British Palestinians.  

The counterterrorism community needs to prove it's worth to the British public; you are costing an awful lot of money, and exist at great cost of civil liberties. It is the bare minimum that you can do, to justify the public spend coming out of His Majesty's Treasury.  

this includes all of the ways that money is channelled into your activities, so I am counting not just the counterterrorism budget itself, but also anything that comes out of local authority spend, anything that comes out of healthcare spend, anything that comes out of justice spend, anything that comes out of education spend... you get the idea.  

At a time when the public purse is so stretched, and our services are so badly harmed by austerity and leaving the European Union, I think it is a great importance that a department that we are to this stay a little unclear on its actual economic impact, and which is currently holding several reports that suggests that its impact is disproportionate to its stated objectives, actually defend the money which the British taxpayer has been contracted into investing, by the nature of government policies supporting this department and its purview.  

Additionally, if this is taking money from community policing, quite frankly it can go back to the police.
