Further evidence that [my left is not weak](https://youtu.be/UM6wrV0VLL4?si=36jiXytBk0JiqW74).  

We are not always defined by Zionism, and unfortunately if the west only accept us when we are Zionists, but refuses us when we are like this, the West is still participating in the same antisemitism that led up to the holocaust; I don't care how many parades you go to average January.  

It matters more that you're not going to do it again, and respectfully: see Palestine, Sudan, Congo... there is a list, and it goes on, and until we don't have a list anymore, some of us will never forget what really caused that catastrophe, who the victims really were, and how it was really resisted against.  

I would rather die standing than live on my knees; the west isn't very good at those kind of Jews either.  

Antisemitism is the same that it's been for 100 years, they've just said that they'll give you a "whites' only" ticket, as long as you put your money and your political loyalty where they tell you to.  

I would rather die fighting, than live as a slave to a machine that gronds our souls. It looks.. uncomfortable, and unappealing.
