Further evidence that [my left is not weak](https://youtu.be/UM6wrV0VLL4?si=36jiXytBk0JiqW74).  

We are not always defined by Zionism, and unfortunately if the west only accept us when we are Zionists, but refuses us when we are like this, the West is still participating in the same antisemitism that led up to the holocaust; I don't care how many parades you go to average January.  

It matters more that you're not going to do it again, and respectfully: see Palestine, Sudan, Congo... there is a list, and it goes on, and until we don't have a list anymore, some of us will never forget what really caused that catastrophe, who the victims really were, and how it was really resisted against.  

I would rather die standing than live on my knees; the west isn't very good at those kind of Jews either.  

Antisemitism is the same that it's been for 100 years, they've just said that they'll give you a "whites' only" ticket, as long as you put your money and your political loyalty where they tell you to.  

I would rather die fighting, than live as a slave to a machine that gronds our souls. It looks.. uncomfortable, and unappealing.

[This is the level of "wtf black mirror thick of it crossover episode is this??", I need for this mess left somewhere near the left.](https://youtu.be/C2I8P6uNmJU?si=l4K-C72hZgXEOIun)  

"They investigate themselves, and it turns out that they're not guilty. Hey, Hey! Daloy Polizei! It means the same thing now as yesterday."  

I also want to pick up one of the quotations from the report, which is around Andrew Feinstein, and this really follows what I've been documenting for some time, which is that amongst other organisations and outfits, labour as a party, and in particular labour together, do you seem to engage with a lot of very antisemitic rhetoric as long as it is in their political interests to do so.  
Discussing a Jewish man, in Britain, as having a somewhat pathological mismatch between his faith and his politics, is antisemitism.  

i'm not going to explain at length right now, because I feel like I've explained it and explained it and explained it so many times recently, but this is a profound gathering of Jewish men, and if it's often done by white men after a Jewish man rejects something the white man wants to do whilst crawling it protection of Jewish people.  

This shows how white men in the labour party routinely engage in a very racist and very sexualised form of orientalised emasculation, of Jewish men. 

I have already given many examples of the discussion behind why that is so problematic and how very much it is rooted in Nazi ideology, how it drove the Holocaust, and also how it currently drives a large amount of Islamophobia today. I hope that you can reference what I've written about in the past.  

It is so saddening as a Jewish woman, to see a party that says it supports Jews, routinely find itself attached to disclosures like this, which suggest that actually there is some really rampant and very unaddressed racism, that a lot of that racism has a psychosexual component, and that the party would rather use that to bully men who are standing on the Jewish values, already a great risk, rather than engage with those men's politics.  
This is a century, at the current point, evidence that the labour party is at the very least unable to hold accountability to forms of antisemitism that it does not see or recognise, or that it does say and it does recognise, but a politically inconvenient to challenge, and for which there is a political incentive to leave unaddressed.  

this is what was mirrored and channelled through the language used towards Zack Polanski in a recent speech by Keir Starmer, and frankly that speech was very concerning for me, and I think for a lot of Jewish people, that clip was very scary. I think a lot of people would struggle to explain why that was, because the emotional undertone is quite indirect, but essentially the labour party called a Jewish man a foreigner, a Russian asset, and apparently did not understand how that microaggression is so dangerous.  

It doesn't matter if the labour party genuinely does not see any of this and it is not meaning to from the bottom of its heart, engage in this rhetoric: it **is** actively engaging in the rhetoric which preceded the Holocaust, and we're not even the chief group of derision this time, and it's *still* this bad.
