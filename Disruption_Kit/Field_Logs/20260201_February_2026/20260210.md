Centroid behaving very strangly, I feel like I've made my point about teddy bears with rubles, I've seen far too much local issue content.  
Another Monday done.

You know, the way British interest gets defended in regard to the Overseas Territories, one would think that we have created a worldwide loop with Trident, for mutually assured destruction should Britannia ever feel sufficiently threatened.  

Which does feel like something the personality of the UK would do...  

I would really like to see all men in the Epstein Files in court, whether President or Prince.  

The time has come.  

It's all getting rather silly, now.  

The psychopomps are here for the old world order; the new is being midwived as we speak.
