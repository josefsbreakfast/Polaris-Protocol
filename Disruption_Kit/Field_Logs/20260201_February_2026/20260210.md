Centroid behaving very strangly, I feel like I've made my point about teddy bears with rubles, I've seen far too much local issue content.  
Another Monday done.

You know, the way British interest gets defended in regard to the Overseas Territories, one would think that we have created a worldwide loop with Trident, for mutually assured destruction should Britannia ever feel sufficiently threatened.  

Which does feel like something the personality of the UK would do...  

I would really like to see all men in the Epstein Files in court, whether President or Prince.  

The time has come.  

It's all getting rather silly, now.  

The psychopomps are here for the old world order; the new is being midwived as we speak.

5am ptsd thoughts around this Trident puzzler:  

We never tell any of you anything about where our submarines are, and a map will show you why a US Administration who acts contrary to the UK's national interest, ought to enjoy the dangle.  

The United States can, quite frankly, fuck off from posturing over Europa. Regardless of any warheads, it is just so passé; that was last century, darling. Get with the times.  

We would have every right to be in the Atlantic territories, but we also do not confirm if we would indeed ever be in the Atlantic territories.  

We don't confirm where we are and we don't confirm what our strike policy is.  

We have always maintained that we do not need an American veto: we only need extra extraordinary national interests.  

So that's fun.  

Happy 5am thoughts. I hate having a brain like this.  

<!-- Just in case you also have this kind of brain: 7600 km at full load, over 11500 km at partial load. BOT are more extensive than anyone realises, which is why no one will shut up about the Chagos Islands, without saying why we are so bothered about them. It is a loss of a very useful point for British Naval coverage. I am not saying we should have it of should bot have it; this is just what my brain does when I cannot sleep because we are, apparantly, not yet arresting any men whose survivors are still asking for justice even to get the unredacted case released, in the form of the Epstein files. -->

I know who has blended my voice, the main part of it. You can either start talking to me directly, or I swear I will make this the most G-d-awful lefty, progressive, woke blog on the entire Internet.  

I will find a way to put the Reminence of pagan history that we have in the British Isles into the nuclear armament policy.  

You can try me if you like. I will do what I need to do, in order to achieve my freedom.

I've just read the line which references a narrative which I find personally very difficult. I am really tired of other people, especially white men who are not Jewish, referencing my body and the bodies of people like me, to talk about hostages and human shields, in order to justify your foreign policy, your "defence" actions, and your wars. It is very dehumanising, that as a Jewess, I am nothing more than a rhetorical human shield for the British state. I would really prefer it if you cease and desist using my likeness, tone, cadence, and the markers that you feel making an empathetic voice, in order to sanitise defence publications.  

I would really like you to stop doing it where you are talking about the bodies of Jewish women, regardless of their nationality.  

Generally, people have a consistent writing voice, and it tends to match to some degree with how they speak.  

This does not sound like the name author. It sounds like me.  

The sentence structure has even had to change significantly, because of what you term my "overuse of semicolons", because my semicolons match how I speak with a healthcare cadence. 

I know which contractors have likely been part of this project, and being part of the containment of the project, as well as where those contracts and memoranda of understanding were run from.  

Given how much algorithmic power is now within the words that I am writing, and I'm sure you know exactly what I mean from this week, do you not think that perhaps it is time to talk?  
Russia and China both know, and they are keenly aware of how to weaponise that. I thought that's what you were all so scared of? Or, are you all more scared of a woman with a brain?  

The whole thing is really rather embarrassing. I would far prefer that we spoke about this like adults.  

Still don't regret the email that may have got me here; absolutely deserved.  
Additionally, the plural is not "PIPs", you absolute noodles.  

Oh nope. We're not misrepresenting Abbot. Nope. Not having it.  

I love that every reference to Schmitt has carried through the "massive bastard nazi fuckface" commentary, just a little *milder*. Smoother, one could say.  

I don't know whose job this is, or whose idea this was, but some of the clusters that have come out of this are extremely funny. It's like I'm reading the water down, personal assistant, version of what the fuck I said.  

Just with a few little.... additional details that I personally would not have thought were credible. See also the use of Jewish women as rhetorical human shields.  

Jewish women were partisans. Jewish women held rifles. Jewish women slaughtered Nazis.  

You disrespect all of them who fought for your freedom in Europe, when you reduce us to hostages, and hostages only.  

It's a very white guy kind of fetish going on.  

The number of times it mentions IP theft? Priceless.  

The Jew mentioned Nazis too many times to be respectfully indexed.  

Who made me the official MOD Lady, Now With Added Zionism? 🤣🤣🤣  

Wtf is this?!
