Centroid behaving very strangly, I feel like I've made my point about teddy bears with rubles, I've seen far too much local issue content.  
Another Monday done.

You know, the way British interest gets defended in regard to the Overseas Territories, one would think that we have created a worldwide loop with Trident, for mutually assured destruction should Britannia ever feel sufficiently threatened.  

Which does feel like something the personality of the UK would do...  

I would really like to see all men in the Epstein Files in court, whether President or Prince.  

The time has come.  

It's all getting rather silly, now.  

The psychopomps are here for the old world order; the new is being midwived as we speak.

5am ptsd thoughts around this Trident puzzler:  

We never tell any of you anything about where our submarines are, and a map will show you why a US Administration who acts contrary to the UK's national interest, ought to enjoy the dangle.  

The United States can, quite frankly, fuck off from posturing over Europa. Regardless of any warheads, it is just so passé; that was last century, darling. Get with the times.  

We would have every right to be in the Atlantic territories, but we also do not confirm if we would indeed ever be in the Atlantic territories.  

We don't confirm where we are and we don't confirm what our strike policy is.  

We have always maintained that we do not need an American veto: we only need extra extraordinary national interests.  

So that's fun.  

Happy 5am thoughts. I hate having a brain like this.
