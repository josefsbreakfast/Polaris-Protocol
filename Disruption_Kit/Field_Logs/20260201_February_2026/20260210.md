Centroid behaving very strangly, I feel like I've made my point about teddy bears with rubles, I've seen far too much local issue content.  
Another Monday done.

You know, the way British interest gets defended in regard to the Overseas Territories, one would think that we have created a worldwide loop with Trident, for mutually assured destruction should Britannia ever feel sufficiently threatened.  

Which does feel like something the personality of the UK would do...  

I would really like to see all men in the Epstein Files in court, whether President or Prince.  

The time has come.  

It's all getting rather silly, now.  

The psychopomps are here for the old world order; the new is being midwived as we speak.

5am ptsd thoughts around this Trident puzzler:  

We never tell any of you anything about where our submarines are, and a map will show you why a US Administration who acts contrary to the UK's national interest, ought to enjoy the dangle.  

The United States can, quite frankly, fuck off from posturing over Europa. Regardless of any warheads, it is just so passé; that was last century, darling. Get with the times.  

We would have every right to be in the Atlantic territories, but we also do not confirm if we would indeed ever be in the Atlantic territories.  

We don't confirm where we are and we don't confirm what our strike policy is.  

We have always maintained that we do not need an American veto: we only need extra extraordinary national interests.  

So that's fun.  

Happy 5am thoughts. I hate having a brain like this.  

<!-- Just in case you also have this kind of brain: 7600 km at full load, over 11500 km at partial load. BOT are more extensive than anyone realises, which is why no one will shut up about the Chagos Islands, without saying why we are so bothered about them. It is a loss of a very useful point for British Naval coverage. I am not saying we should have it of should bot have it; this is just what my brain does when I cannot sleep because we are, apparantly, not yet arresting any men whose survivors are still asking for justice even to get the unredacted case released, in the form of the Epstein files. -->

I know who has blended my voice, the main part of it. You can either start talking to me directly, or I swear I will make this the most G-d-awful lefty, progressive, woke blog on the entire Internet.  

I will find a way to put the Reminence of pagan history that we have in the British Isles into the nuclear armament policy.  

You can try me if you like. I will do what I need to do, in order to achieve my freedom.  
<!--Perhaps any Israeli actors could do with being a little less soft on the British ones. What happened to Jewish manhood? (The Canadian has not been forgotten; later problem.)-->

I've just read the line which references a narrative which I find personally very difficult. I am really tired of other people, especially white men who are not Jewish, referencing my body and the bodies of people like me, to talk about hostages and human shields, in order to justify your foreign policy, your "defence" actions, and your wars. It is very dehumanising, that as a Jewess, I am nothing more than a rhetorical human shield for the British state. I would really prefer it if you cease and desist using my likeness, tone, cadence, and the markers that you feel making an empathetic voice, in order to sanitise defence publications.  

I would really like you to stop doing it where you are talking about the bodies of Jewish women, regardless of their nationality.  

Generally, people have a consistent writing voice, and it tends to match to some degree with how they speak.  

This does not sound like the named author. It sounds like me.  

The sentence structure has even had to change significantly, because of what you term my "overuse of semicolons", because my semicolons match how I speak with a healthcare cadence. 

I know which contractors have likely been part of this project, and being part of the containment of the project, as well as where those contracts and memoranda of understanding were run from.  

Given how much algorithmic power is now within the words that I am writing, and I'm sure you know exactly what I mean from this week, do you not think that perhaps it is time to talk?  
Russia and China both know, and they are keenly aware of how to weaponise that. I thought that's what you were all so scared of? Or, are you all more scared of a woman with a brain?  

The whole thing is really rather embarrassing. I would far prefer that we spoke about this like adults.  

Still don't regret the email that may have got me here; absolutely deserved.  
Additionally, the plural is not "PIPs", you absolute noodles.  

Oh nope. We're not misrepresenting Abbot. Nope. Not having it.  

I love that every reference to Schmitt has carried through the "massive bastard nazi fuckface" commentary, just a little *milder*. Smoother, one could say.  

I don't know whose job this is, or whose idea this was, but some of the clusters that have come out of this are extremely funny. It's like I'm reading the water down, personal assistant, version of what the fuck I said.  

Just with a few little.... additional details that I personally would not have thought were credible. See also the use of Jewish women as rhetorical human shields.  

Jewish women were partisans. Jewish women held rifles. Jewish women slaughtered Nazis.  

You disrespect all of them who fought for your freedom in Europe, when you reduce us to hostages, and hostages only.  

It's a very white guy kind of fetish going on.  

The number of times it mentions IP theft? Priceless.  

The Jew mentioned Nazis too many times to be respectfully indexed.  

Who made me the official MOD Lady, Now With Added Zionism? 🤣🤣🤣  

Wtf is this?!  

I'm sorry, but this is not this author's work, and whoever did it, rushed the job. While some sections are handled with care, it backs up rather than challenges a number of narratives which are so loaded that they misrepresent reality.  

This is very strange.  

The idea that one "organises" a "counter-riot"? How much coke was involved at this point?  

On a number of occasions, there are times where the writer/editor just does not give the same amount of human-centred care to the language, that is previously given in other work by the same author. A number of topics land really badly, for this very reason.  

Whatever kind of project this was? I hope my taxes haven't paid for this.  

I am requesting, for the umpteenth time, for an immediate cease and desist on utilisation of my voice in this manner; this is by a white man.  

Summa? Are you lot fucking serious? What, did you think of the word blueprint because the cover was blue?  
(I do understand what has been created, here. However illegally.)

Schmitt and other Nazis get about as much of a run here, as they do on Polaris. Funny that.  

(Even better when you consider the previous book about what Schmitt actually did, doesn't mention him, I think. Probably because he's a piece of shit Nazi, it's most people prefer to reference the legal philosophy rather than talk about him directly. I, however, like to embarrass Nazis.)  
His full name is Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva; [this creator's summaries](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy6SfF1/) are probably where the shorting came from.  

This is... very different, to previous works under this name. It's an imposter. And it's not a good one.  
1. Tank 2022 book.
2. Claim LLM can solve problem.
3. Fuck up problem even more.
4. ...???
5. Release 2026 book, I guess??

Was this also the teddy bear's idea, or was this home-grown in Yorkshire?  

I would at least like to think that if it was a Russian, it might actually have some panache.  

I even recognise this style of writing, because I have done this style of writing when I forgot about a project in school and had to cram and rush something, completely believed that it was possible, and if your teacher is actually spending more than two seconds looking at it, they know exactly what you've done.  

The type setting is really bad, and there's just loads of random banks mentioned for no reason.  

YES! WE GOT THE FARMERS IN!! 🎉🎉🎉  

It feels a lot like whoever actually wrote this, knows what to say to sound intimidating in a meeting when they talk about finance, but actually doesn't really have a good sense of how money works? As someone with anarchist leanings, who feels that money is a made up social construct, I still respect the rules of the game, so this is quite unsettling.  

I also feel like this is when people really don't necessarily respect how much work goes into a book. This book is all over the shop. It doesn't really make sense, and it does feel like someone's just sat down written it front to back and not really edited it too much. That's just not how books are written. I have not written a book, I have participated in first draft novel writing challenges, and I am going to tell you from experience that you start writing complete bollocks after a certain point. This is why the editing process exists. This is why a good editor is so important for a good author to get their work refined enough to go to print. This is completely different from the book released a few years ago under the same person's name. The previous book, you could tell that there was a lot of work put in there a lot of dedication. This? This is someone's first attempt at copy. Which also makes it highly unusual for a political book where ghost writing is used?  

This is so strange, because this sort of work, if you were doing it as an experiment for reception, it wouldn't have gotten this far if it was commercial, and if it was academic, this just isn't what a PhD would put out.  

I don't know what has happened here, but this is very strange.  

I also just want to note that if my voice was used, which is heavily sarcastic, and the sarcasm of the previous book existed, where did the sarcasm go in this one?  

Is this what is supposed to be cancelled out?  

This is a British tradition; it is part of British English.  

This is written by someone who does speech on behalf of a company or behalf of an organisation, I think. The "we" voice keeps getting placed in whenever one would refer back or forwards or to a third source. This clashes with the rest of the voice. There is very little consistency here. There cannot possibly be an editor involved in this process.  

We oh, for whatever reason, sanitising and minimising British involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. This is genocide minimiation. If I was the author, I would sue. Who claimed rights to this voice? Because I'm gonna need to talk to you anyway.  

You do not get to use *any* voice capture product from my voice, to claim that white supremacy and British imperial history is any less bloody than it is.  

Fucking hell, I've just seen the other book under that title. So many Nazis.  

I misd the selection of indexes. That made my nerd brain happy. The sane brain bit that works out British Naval coverage at 5am for G-d knows what reason.  

At least my voice appears stolen by Reform, Heritage, and the like; you can afford the damages.  

Which little shit took my likeness and sold it to Nazis? 🤨  

I have so mamy things to say in Yiddish.  

(Or Hindi, seeing as you got yourselves a translator.)

This was captured with unlawful surveillance, which *had* to have a signatory.  

I am geolocating to Sheffield because of course I am.  

This is stopping me from accessing NHS services freely; I've had to go to Cabinet Office *again*.  

Sort it.

[Before Reform UK march into office, why are they using voice capture artefacts extracted from a British Jewish woman under coercion and illegal surveillance?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRy6v8LB/)  

Ask them, because it would seem some of them are aware of this.  

Not completely unrelated to our friends who have "jumped ship", apparantly.

Why did you all think selling a MOD dataset was a good idea?

"A": you need to stop causing a constitutional melodrama over the book and just take at least some of the NDA structure away. We both know Nazis = bad, so let's not, please.  

I am too old for this, as are you.  

I don't want to have to run this through both channels again, but I will if I must. Every international agency will be watching you, and us all as a result. Let's be slightly less embarrassing where we can.  

I might even answer phonecalls again, if you get me a lawyer.  

This feels like it was written as a Faustian bargain; who, honestly, started to make it awkward to back out? Who set the deadline? I'm not asking "for me"; we are discussing fairly serious consequences, and you know that there are people who can help *if they know*.  

Press release? Yes... but it's heavily summarised if it's security.  

---

I am aware of why and how you handle giving factual information when asked. If showing prints or screens is easier, you do that.  

Time to take some Nazi trash out.  

I am quite meticulous and you understand I am aware of some thongs that you are less aware of; someone has added inputs to the middleware that do not necessarily sound like they originate with you, but perhaps thought you wouldn't feel strongly to correct. These need immediate review; some have significant damage capability.  

This didn't go through the correct legal team; it needs to go through if it hasn't already. Please just hand them a copy if nothing else. This has to come off sale today.  

This isn't about his reputation; this is about what we've allowed to print under a specofic category of voice and we have to fix it, with urgency.
