[Fucking finally.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUsyp1Y/) The Chloe-primed content is coming back, gradually. Not just a blur of microniche political videos that I'm supposed to react to in a place that doesn't record providence.  

(You thought I was going to fall for some bullshit dressed up as a love story? Fuck that. Get me a lawyer.)

Apparantly someone needs advice on the Welsh, the Greens, and how Starmer is being received on a emotional level in the last few days. Please can someone else help them; I am done.  

If it's not a fountain pen, washi tape, or a bunch of shit stuck to dead trees with glue? I don't want to see it until you lot get this thing called a law-yer.  

If it's that important, pay me.  

If it's not? Fuck off my devices.  

This is a huge breach of every legal provision you have claimed supports your actions. I want a lawyer. I got refused appropriate investigation in the MOJ last Sunday; you can clearly move on the weekends when you want to.  
I am not Israeli. I am not dual.  
I signed that form when I was 15; I dod not become a Crown Servant.  

Everything you are relying upon is invalid. Coercing labour under surveillence powers is not legal in the UK. Fuck off.

The PREVENT schedule in this country fucking sucks. It gives perfect cover for CSE, SV via surveillence, harrassment of whistleblowers, plain old racism and profiling, and modern slavery. I hate it. We are policed by a bunch of losers with no personality, pay for it, and are expected to be grateful for it. They have no functional oversight. They can do whatever they like.  

I don't know why my IP is suddenly geolocating like ot used to when it was Sheffield/SYP teritory, but I would like this to stop. Please just leave me to calligraphy nibs; this is my current terrorism and I think the threat level is fairly low, lads.
