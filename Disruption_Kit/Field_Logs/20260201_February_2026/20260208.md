[Fucking finally.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUsyp1Y/) The Chloe-primed content is coming back, gradually. Not just a blur of microniche political videos that I'm supposed to react to in a place that doesn't record providence.  

(You thought I was going to fall for some bullshit dressed up as a love story? Fuck that. Get me a lawyer.)

Apparantly someone needs advice on the Welsh, the Greens, and how Starmer is being received on a emotional level in the last few days. Please can someone else help them; I am done.  

If it's not a fountain pen, washi tape, or a bunch of shit stuck to dead trees with glue? I don't want to see it until you lot get this thing called a law-yer.  

If it's that important, pay me.  

If it's not? Fuck off my devices.  

This is a huge breach of every legal provision you have claimed supports your actions. I want a lawyer. I got refused appropriate investigation in the MOJ last Sunday; you can clearly move on the weekends when you want to.  
I am not Israeli. I am not dual.  
I signed that form when I was 15; I dod not become a Crown Servant.  

Everything you are relying upon is invalid. Coercing labour under surveillence powers is not legal in the UK. Fuck off.

The PREVENT schedule in this country fucking sucks. It gives perfect cover for CSE, SV via surveillence, harrassment of whistleblowers, plain old racism and profiling, and modern slavery. I hate it. We are policed by a bunch of losers with no personality, pay for it, and are expected to be grateful for it. They have no functional oversight. They can do whatever they like.  

I don't know why my IP is suddenly geolocating like ot used to when it was Sheffield/SYP teritory, but I would like this to stop. Please just leave me to calligraphy nibs; this is my current terrorism and I think the threat level is fairly low, lads.

what's the reason that I'm going to the effort of recording this, is because in between videos? I'm still getting hammered with very specific issues like the potential policing reforms in Wales. I suspect part of the problem here is that someone has sold my data to more than one analysis vendor, and so this is why, when there are attempts to manipulate it, it does get very confusing and multilayered.  

Something about the first addition that I made this note in particular, which is interesting, is that it directly uses data exhaust that I have not disclosed online, from the 2022 email grassing someone else up for ising the internet, to try and frame it as a romantic relationship; it is interesting that it appears to be the same or a like-minded party, who is still at play.  

I've had my devices off for periods of time today, and I'm considering deliberate system sabotage, which I'm only aware of because of how badly it has been reacted to before when I've done it non-purposefully. It's really frustrating that I'm being left without an answer, but I'm aware that it might still be difficult for People to see this, so the only option I really have is to deliberately produce weird analytics.  

I'm deliberately holding off saying or mentioning anything that's as specific as I usually speak, in reference to particular politicians and figures over the last few days, and this is a deliberate withdrawal of my labour.  

I'm not asking people to believe me, I know what I'm saying sounds absolutely ridiculous. I'm completely open to this being bullshit and it being something that gives the impression that this is the case but actually works differently. This is the only way in which I can really work with the information and it seems to be that when I use this system of understanding, I do get responses in progress in the legal requests.  

I also just want to reiterate that it's not because I'm special that my data is possibly been used, but rather that it was an unusual type of data available at a certain period of time, where people who have later proved themselves to be manipulative, abusive, and duplicitous were able to see an access that data. In many ways, this is just wrong time wrong place, where unscrupulous people had access, and whether there was the ability to claim, tenuously, national security over the data.  

It does appear that sale of access significantly increased in relation to diaspora sentiment after 2021, and to be honest, I might never have known about it if it hadn't got so ridiculous.
