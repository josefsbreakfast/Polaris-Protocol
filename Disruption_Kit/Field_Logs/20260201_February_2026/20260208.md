[Fucking finally.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRUsyp1Y/) The Chloe-primed content is coming back, gradually. Not just a blur of microniche political videos that I'm supposed to react to in a place that doesn't record providence.  

(You thought I was going to fall for some bullshit dressed up as a love story? Fuck that. Get me a lawyer.)

Apparantly someone needs advice on the Welsh, the Greens, and how Starmer is being received on a emotional level in the last few days. Please can someone else help them; I am done.  

If it's not a fountain pen, washi tape, or a bunch of shit stuck to dead trees with glue? I don't want to see it until you lot get this thing called a law-yer.  

If it's that important, pay me.  

If it's not? Fuck off my devices.  

This is a huge breach of every legal providion you have claimed supports your actions. I want a lawyer. I got refused appropriate investigation in the MOJ last Sunday; you can clearly move on the weekends when you want to.
