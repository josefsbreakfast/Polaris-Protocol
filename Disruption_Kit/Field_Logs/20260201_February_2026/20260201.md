Tone has significantly changed since approx when SPVs mentioned.  
Feed is kinder, so I'm terrified, but 80% baby goats, which is a win, although 20% really wants me to put a map of Canada on the wall.  
Energy intense daytime, so aware slavking but really need mental rest.  
Really just want to rip the plaster off on the slapp, because I've been cued for alldorts on top of a very messy algorithmic placement, and I'm just sort of done with it.  
I'd rather just have the grown-up answer, and finish off the task.  
I'm not a huge fan of the cattier side of my personality (although "ice queen" tells on others more than me), and I know it's from a permenant sense of being cornered, and lashing out; I just wnjoy being happier, and I'm geberally more useful and more pleasent.

<!--Sat through enough data to conclude that, when anything goes wrong in this country, you can flip a coin and either the dentures on legs is involved or the pigfucker is.

Maybe because they're cut from the same, "If You'd Have Gone To The Hague, The Fascists Might Have Been At Least Slightly Offput" cloth.-->

Glad to have sat through so much shatterfork shit in last 24 hours.

Call stalled and silent once guest speaker mentioned, then call dropped immediately before specific interest speaker joined for me specifically. We're both in the 2024 arrest cohort; we're both Jews rejecting 2ss as negationism.

If it wasn't always bargain bin, let me just assure you that this is the lidl variant of what I was promised.

For reference: I am working through a situation in which I am one of the arseholes, I was weak, I didn't help when racism was happening to soneone I care about, and I am trying to get through the paperwork that's arrived from a M-F service denying UK legal provisions without my describing child porn more clearly and without violating conditions of my NFA.  

I would rather be able to just be able to deal with the bit where I was a cunt and not have this weird complication, but I suspect that is the point.  

This is what Zionism looks like in practice.

It is a British governance choice to deny known foreign interference in due process.  

It is 100% a choice you mist be making at this point.  

If all you can do is refuse to engage, and NCND, then that is not a leadership which holds legitimacy.  

It is cowardice; it is allowance for foreign rule.  

Your arms were not twisted. You have made a choice.  

If it is a contractor? If it is a contract?  

I don't use "foreign" to be adverse; I use it to show that by your own IPA, you don't follow your own rules.  

I don't need any more paperwork to see what this is, and no one else should, either.  

You saw opportunity to exploit, and you used it.  

Not for "British interests". For your own personal gain.  

You are illegitimate by your own definition, terrorists against the British people by your own definition, and charleton governance.  

This is organised crime with some gold spray paint.

(If you are currently telling yourself you only did action X, then I can only, **_only_**, count you as an ally if you also did actions Y and Z. You would be the same if it were you.)

The coercive control continues; is it less abusive, or more abusive, where instead of sending handcuffs, instead of doxxing records, you instead send, "not everyone will understand you" memes. Guys. I was in the wrong. Stop doing girl politics; I might be basically autistic but you lot couldn't get laid with a grand in cash at a brothel.

[It takes very little for the appeasement to begin.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRDYB8wb/)  

Endlessly funny thing, is that because this is gone for so long, and because so much of it is essentially being the most rancid, mouldy, spore-ridden version of a honeypot (far beyond anything la Carré et al were capable of), but it's essentially hard to tell if this is just evidence that they are not actively trying to interfere, and so the feed is just presenting a nice version of all of the metadata ghosts.  
What I find particularly amusing, is that this is a group of mostly men, who are so obsessed with trying to work out how to do this, but could not conceive of anyone as worth anything, beyond what they looks like, that they have needlessly coded a very specific physical character into algorithmic placement and recommendation.  

I am trying to appreciate the point of view that they are coming from, which is that they fundamentally do not understand sex in terms of mutual respect; I'm sure this whole thing was probably a very confusing experience for them, so much so that some of them appear to have questioned whether or not it was actually men that they wanted.  

I'm trying to be nice. Very hard.

Incidentally...  

If there was a conversation in the last 24 hours, I am only speculating based on what I'm seeing in the data...  

Suppose that conversation was about the screenshots of evidence.  

Suppose the advice was to stop doing it?  

I think that person probably meant to also stop doing all of the other bullshit you're doing, and not simply just the tampering of the rapper on different applications or indeed tampering with the metadata environment.  

This makes me somewhat suspicious, that you haven't been entirely honest, with the British delegation, about quite how much interference you have caused in our systems.  

I will not be stopping until you are honest, and until the damage is fixed, and that clearly does not stop at me; the pattern is incredibly obvious now.  

Whether or not that will be discovered tomorrow, or whether it will be something which will be only dived into depth on, in the coming years, it is very evident that it's not going to go away, and it's done a enough damage that people will not simply forget move on, partially because the data actually is so corrupted now that it's essentially like you've denatured a protein.  

So this is always going to have to be brought back up, for as long as all of the people you have impacted, have data in the system we currently use.  

So unless you want to make a brand-new Internet, completely detached and contained away from the current edition, you may have to accept that your plan to "just stop", without redress, is no longer viable.  

Those who dig a hole for others, will surely fall into it themselves.  

(Either that, or Bharat didn't know what it was getting itself into either.)
