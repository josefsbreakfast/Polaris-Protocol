[For the record, I would consider tighter border controls, if they kept out rich white American paedophiles and rapists.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRygWxkD/)  

I said "consider"; I'm still not sure about boys drawing imaginary lines at all, really.  

I mean, when you think about it, it's fascinating that the same people who can respect a border, can't respect a "no", can't seem to work out that an unconscious person can't consent, or seem to think that consent from a teenager when they themselves are an adult, is valid.  

Again, if there were any consistency, I might be able to understand any of your points about these "borders".  

My vagina has a border, has it always been respected? Has immigration control always been given adequate enforcement powers?  

No, because many white men would rather end our species, than respect anyone else's power.  

It's as if they all think they have their own personal little nuclear mutual-destruction option, but no one's been down to maintain it, and it's questionable if the crew is even still alive down there.

[Are we in a dictatorship? Is this like the "pre-Reform" easing-in for fascism?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRyg3KWQ/)  

That is an interview which will only be brushed aside at great peril; that is highly unusual and very serious.  

Americans: consult your nearest emotional support Briton for advice.  

This reminds me a lot of when we had several hunger strike prisoners who had been on hunger strike for so long, that they were at risk of imminent death, and it was really unclear whether or not the cabinet actually understood what was going on, which is very strange. This is why, when you look at it, it could be that the Prime Minister is acting honestly, but if so, this would suggest that there is a serious communications issue going on, there is far beyond incompetence, and looks more like active interference.

I haven't had functional Internet on my Wi-Fi for over a day by the way, but... standard, innit.  

I can't be bothered to keep changing VPN, but 5G seems *alright*. Touch wood. 🤣🤣🤣  

Maybe I've upset the little Tsarina princess bear. 🥺🥺🥺  

Poor little ego. So fragile.  

i'm also getting some ready specific errors in things like clipboard you said, just the usual "meddling to be annoying" sort of behaviour.

[I do love how basically every person who comments on this, is like "what the fuck".](https://www.tiktok.com/@walesjournalist/video/7605655526260706582)  

The politics of the United States does not translate directly onto the UK; we are not a "mini US". I'm not saying that as a good or a bad thing, it's completely neutral. We are just not that, which is why it's really funny to watch all of this money being spent on parties like Reform, because parties like that are actually quite fragile in a UK political ecosystem.

Temporarily put of online ordering. Nvm.  

Still a silly goose.  

Btw geolocating to Virginia, which is fun.
