[For the record, I would consider tighter border controls, if they kept out rich white American paedophiles and rapists.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRygWxkD/)  

I said "consider"; I'm still not sure about boys drawing imaginary lines at all, really.  

I mean, when you think about it, it's fascinating that the same people who can respect a border, can't respect a "no", can't seem to work out that an unconscious person can't consent, or seem to think that consent from a teenager when they themselves are an adult, is valid.  

Again, if there were any consistency, I might be able to understand any of your points about these "borders".  

My vagina has a border, has it always been respected? Has immigration control always been given adequate enforcement powers?  

No, because many white men would rather end our species, than respect anyone else's power.  

It's as if they all think they have their own personal little nuclear mutual-destruction option, but no one's been down to maintain it, and it's questionable if the crew is even still alive down there.

That is an interview which will only be brushed aside at great peril; that is highly unusual and very serious.  

Americans: consult your nearest emotional support Briton for advice.  

This reminds me a lot of when we had several hunger strike prisoners who had been on hunger strike for so long, that they were at risk of imminent death, and it was really unclear whether or not the cabinet actually understood what was going on, which is very strange. This is why, when you look at it, it could be that the Prime Minister is acting honestly, but if so, this would suggest that there is a serious communications issue going on, there is far beyond incompetence, and looks more like active interference.

The politics of the United States does not translate directly onto the UK; we are not a "mini US". I'm not saying that as a good or a bad thing, it's completely neutral. We are just not that, which is why it's really funny to watch all of this money being spent on parties like Reform, because parties like that are actually quite fragile in a UK political ecosystem.

[Much to say; a woman will only be able to have a significant impact on culture, where she is empowered to do so.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/11/furious-female-labour-mps-urge-starmer-to-make-a-woman-his-de-facto-deputy) There are several wonderful examples, who have already been in Cabinet, of female leadership in the Labour Party. Simply desiring change on one issue is not enough; the skillset and track record of eradicating toxic hypermasculinity are essential, where the culture is so impacted. This is not a matter of disrespect to "new blood", and I don't always believe that this is necessary, but complete novelty when we are peri-constitutional crisis, in a moment of parliamentary history, is quite a bold step.  

There are several women in the party who may or may not wish for the role, but have the provable track record behind tolerating that level of leadership, some of them whilst being eviserated daily by national press. The entire world would be on hand to criticise such a woman, with alt right bot farms only adding to our own donestic cultivation of misogyny; this cannot be someone who cannot stand through horrific scrutiny, which will absolutely be thrown at her.  

A woman in this position will not simply be judged on her own record, but the record of any company she keeps, any and all risks in her office, and must somehow also be a woman on top of all that. This is not a job for anyone who cannot be utterly ruthless, alike to the Prime Minister himself, as well as the King in the summer, when it comes to cutting all chaffe from their vicinity.  

We must not only do what the men do; we nust also do it "backwards and in heels".  

We live in a world which hates women, we have a media which hates women, and the hounds infesting Whitehall live to see a goid woman fall. Demonstrable strength must follow courage of conviction.  

And a sword. Mostly to scare the men into not being ridiculous.

In other news, according to the LLM book, this author has a tenous grasp of mathematical analysis; I find this curious, given the reports I have seen, which have significant similarity to the actual author's analysis. One of which is about rape survivorship and community outcomes, actually.  

The stitch-up email comes between the last authored report, and this example that I am aware of. Quite curious.

[Perhaps a hot take, but actually I think Kemi Badenoch has the sort of mettle that is needed, where the women in the Labour Party are looking for female leadership to make a difference.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98qene0gpdo) I may not be on board with her politics, and she has served under men who have been as disappointing on gender as every British government in recent memory, but Kemi is essentially holding the Conservatives together and giving their image CPR on a daily basis, whilst doing it backwards, in high heels, and somehow like a swan across water. She is doing this in a notoriously hypermasculine environment, both in terms of public politics, but also in terms of the particular party she operates within. It would be more interesting to see her be given more strategic direction herself, but this is a reality of both larger parties: donors and lobbies have a disproportionate impact on modern UK politics. This often hems party leaders into a box which is not even of their own making.  

Have the Conservatives improved as a boys club since her leadership? I have no idea, but this is the level of public image under pressure expected from forces outside the party, who seek to tear a party to shreds, and as women we must not simply resist that, but do the job as well... any transformational change would be an additional ask on top of that.  

Any men who want to use a woman as a bandaid are unserious at best, outright sadistic at worst.

True, nostly unarmed in terms of firearms, but the impact of these under the last government and the current one is incredibly stressful for local communities. Is anyone in the Labour Party left wing anymore?  

"I want a Panopticon", but also "We don't have ICE raids here"?  

Am I missing the key step?  

These are all dehumanising tactics.

For the record, Becca Balint (who is not named in the indexable text, unhelpfully) voted against a niche resolution that sought to criminalise the phrase, "from the river to the sea", arguing that it would unfairly weaponise antisemitism claims against Palestinians under active genocide. Becca Balint's family were Holocaust victims and survivors. Pam Bondi is a Nazi talking head. Pam Bondi can stfu.  

I am not yet able to forgive white goyim that enabled this dynamic; go fuck yourselves.

I will say this for free:  

After the genocide, I dropped the politeness after overextension, and a lot of people are somehow realising for the first time that I have brain cells in my skull.  

Interesting that we always pressure women to be polite, but only respect women when we're not polite.

Honestly this is very "white duse under theeat" behaviour.  

I am currently getting so mamy weird UK SAR returns. As a total set, they contradict eaxh other.  

Someone can't keep a story straight, it seems.  

---

The funny thing is, that simply because no one wanted to deal with a slightly awkward complaints with reasonable basis at a local level, we're now at "active international embarrasment" level.  

If Britain were to die, that's how we would go – too embarrassed to look at the hole in the bow, letting the ship sink rather than act.  

Wrapped in a Union flag, singing "G-d Save The King"... and we would do this over an otherwise minor leak.  

Whatever potentially local, potentially national, factor is running around like a headless chicken talking everyone out of FOIA compliance, is actively contradicting the SARs so much, that as a bundle they are very obviously stating a set of facts which give open contradictions, show clear temporal parrallels where there have been meetings or shared briefings, and indicate either undeclared deletions or ommissions. Thet align with a particular social network which does involve some Labour figues, but is ultimately not politically aligned, and is either actively alt right, or exposing an inherent weakness that the alt right in the UK was relying on.  

Whatever this is, it's as if the ranking of preference is:  
1. Labour, because tribalism
2. Alt right, but they don't like being called Nazis
3. Liberal Democrats/Conservatives, if they are useful
(The Greens are considered the dross and untouchable, apparantly.)

I don't think this is one person; I think "a small handful" is more accurate, and I think whatever it is is deeply challenged by McSweeney and Allan in particular have gone. They seem to be somewhat removed from Mandelson.  

this is another reason why I'm incredibly conscious that anyone who brings in what looks like new blood at this time, needs to really explain why that is, because this looks a lot more like installing allies, than actually anything positive. This kind of behaviour I've seen so many times, it's always done to people who are otherwise really good, and have a lot of potential, which is why while I sound really harsh, it's out of compassion for those people that they are not used in processes like this.  

You can have the same person go forward, as long as whatever or whoever is the influence that seeks to use their position and their connections, is cut off completely.  

One of the biggest problems that I personally found from the whole Julian Assange thing, is it so many leftist men who I admired, really threw themselves under the bus to protect a man who had credible accusations at the time; someone can be nice or good in some ways, and they can still do really shitty things, because they just fundamentally don't think that that thing is wrong to do.  

This is the bit that we keep saying is teachable to a lot of men, so whilst some men will never be able to learn to respect women, some of them can, and by refusing to engage in this at all, or only engage in the surface where it suits image only, we end up in a position where we are never going to fix this on the left. Labour is already in a position where it's so mainstream, and there are so many other parties who are even worse for this on the left, that seriously the embarrassed amount of improvement, would make the party so much safer for women.  

*cough cough* *swp*  

It's not just one party. This is a problem which has never been addressed on the left. This is the problem which undermines the left, because women are most likely to do most of the free shitty labour that you need in order to organise a political movement.  

I'm not saying you should use this that way, but you are literally shooting ourselves in the foot, where you can't even settle for using us in a slightly less exploited way, because you are so in love with protecting dangerous men.  

Conservatives: don't even get me started. One of your MPs was basically talking through how Donald Trump didn't do a rape, even though the incident would be a rape in the UK. The particular way in which they did this, actually undermine the basis of the law for rape in the UK. So that was great.  

This is a problem across society, and it is a problem which countries and stakeholders who seek to undermine the UK economically, are very aware of and are actively utilising in order to cut us off from international influence.  

But sure: women are the real problem.  
[Ed, sweetie, no....: the country does want the party to sort this out. The party cannot keep undermining half of the country.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRyw5eyo/)  

[Whatever this is, it is nearly a symptom of what is clearly a capture problem, which is impact in communications chokeholds, and this is what is fundamentally tearing that party apart.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRywUtXW/)  

I would like to remind that I'm a party that one of the most senior civil servants that we have, regarding an appointment of the most senior civil servant in the country, literally went to the media because they didn't trust that they were going to get a response to their email to Cabinet Office about a serious whistleblowing matter; there is something wrong, and if the senior team are not aware of it, they need to look into who the fuck is talking to them and saying everything is okay.  

it's not okay, and there are people in very different advocacy areas who are telling you that it's not okay. The Conservatives do not appear to be having this exact communication problem, which points are more of a political party issue than a civil service issue (although Ultimate ultimately doesn't excluded if it were a deliberate timed attack), it appears to be something that's coming with Labour; whether this is a cultural issue a personal issue or a cyber security issue, or a combination of those, that doesn't matter. It needs to be fixed.  

This can literally be done with more localised infiltration via cyber security means, or three manipulation of applications and analysis that the party uses, or the CRM. Given that Peter Mandelson used to run the CRM and was really one of the big power houses behind it, that might be a good place to check to make sure that things are working tickety boo.  

If it was a CRM impact, then what is impacting the CRM is literally tried to oust both the Prime Minister minister and the Royal Family this week, so I would consider it to be a national security issue at this point.
