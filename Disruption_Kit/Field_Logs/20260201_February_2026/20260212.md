[For the record, I would consider tighter border controls, if they kept out rich white American paedophiles and rapists.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRygWxkD/)  

I said "consider"; I'm still not sure about boys drawing imaginary lines at all, really.  

I mean, when you think about it, it's fascinating that the same people who can respect a border, can't respect a "no", can't seem to work out that an unconscious person can't consent, or seem to think that consent from a teenager when they themselves are an adult, is valid.  

Again, if there were any consistency, I might be able to understand any of your points about these "borders".  

My vagina has a border, has it always been respected? Has immigration control always been given adequate enforcement powers?  

No, because many white men would rather end our species, than respect anyone else's power.
