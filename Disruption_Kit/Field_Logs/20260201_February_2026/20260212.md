[For the record, I would consider tighter border controls, if they kept out rich white American paedophiles and rapists.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRygWxkD/)  

I said "consider"; I'm still not sure about boys drawing imaginary lines at all, really.  

I mean, when you think about it, it's fascinating that the same people who can respect a border, can't respect a "no", can't seem to work out that an unconscious person can't consent, or seem to think that consent from a teenager when they themselves are an adult, is valid.  

Again, if there were any consistency, I might be able to understand any of your points about these "borders".  

My vagina has a border, has it always been respected? Has immigration control always been given adequate enforcement powers?  

No, because many white men would rather end our species, than respect anyone else's power.  

It's as if they all think they have their own personal little nuclear mutual-destruction option, but no one's been down to maintain it, and it's questionable if the crew is even still alive down there.

That is an interview which will only be brushed aside at great peril; that is highly unusual and very serious.  

Americans: consult your nearest emotional support Briton for advice.  

This reminds me a lot of when we had several hunger strike prisoners who had been on hunger strike for so long, that they were at risk of imminent death, and it was really unclear whether or not the cabinet actually understood what was going on, which is very strange. This is why, when you look at it, it could be that the Prime Minister is acting honestly, but if so, this would suggest that there is a serious communications issue going on, there is far beyond incompetence, and looks more like active interference.

The politics of the United States does not translate directly onto the UK; we are not a "mini US". I'm not saying that as a good or a bad thing, it's completely neutral. We are just not that, which is why it's really funny to watch all of this money being spent on parties like Reform, because parties like that are actually quite fragile in a UK political ecosystem.

[Much to say; a woman will only be able to have a significant impact on culture, where she is empowered to do so.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/11/furious-female-labour-mps-urge-starmer-to-make-a-woman-his-de-facto-deputy) There are several wonderful examples, who have already been in Cabinet, of female leadership in the Labour Party. Simply desiring change on one issue is not enough; the skillset and track record of eradicating toxic hypermasculinity are essential, where the culture is so impacted. This is not a matter of disrespect to "new blood", and I don't always believe that this is necessary, but complete novelty when we are peri-constitutional crisis, in a moment of parliamentary history, is quite a bold step.  

There are several women in the party who may or may not wish for the role, but have the provable track record behind tolerating that level of leadership, some of them whilst being eviserated daily by national press. The entire world would be on hand to criticise such a woman, with alt right bot farms only adding to our own donestic cultivation of misogyny; this cannot be someone who cannot stand through horrific scrutiny, which will absolutely be thrown at her.  

A woman in this position will not simply be judged on her own record, but the record of any company she keeps, any and all risks in her office, and must somehow also be a woman on top of all that. This is not a job for anyone who cannot be utterly ruthless, alike to the Prime Minister himself, as well as the King in the summer, when it comes to cutting all chaffe from their vicinity.  

We must not only do what the men do; we nust also do it "backwards and in heels".  

We live in a world which hates women, we have a media which hates women, and the hounds infesting Whitehall live to see a goid woman fall. Demonstrable strength must follow courage of conviction.  

And a sword. Mostly to scare the men into not being ridiculous.

In other news, according to the LLM book, this author has a tenous grasp of mathematical analysis; I find this curious, given the reports I have seen, which have significant similarity to the actual author's analysis. One of which is about rape survivorship and community outcomes, actually.  

The stitch-up email comes between the last authored report, and this example that I am aware of. Quite curious.

[Perhaps a hot take, but actually I think Kemi Badenoch has the sort of mettle that is needed, where the women in the Labour Party are looking for female leadership to make a difference.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98qene0gpdo) I may not be on board with her politics, and she has served under men who have been as disappointing on gender as every British government in recent memory, but Kemi is essentially holding the Conservatives together and giving their image CPR on a daily basis, whilst doing it backwards, in high heels, and somehow like a swan across water. She is doing this in a notoriously hypermasculine environment, both in terms of public politics, but also in terms of the particular party she operates within. It would be more interesting to see her be given more strategic direction herself, but this is a reality of both larger parties: donors and lobbies have a disproportionate impact on modern UK politics. This often hems party leaders into a box which is not even of their own making.  

Have the Conservatives improved as a boys club since her leadership? I have no idea, but this is the level of public image under pressure expected from forces outside the party, who seek to tear a party to shreds, and as women we must not simply resist that, but do the job as well... any transformational change would be an additional ask on top of that.  

Any men who want to use a woman as a bandaid are unserious at best, outright sadistic at worst.

[This is misleading.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRyn8NDs/) We do have raids which are increasingly mirroring ICE tactics. True, nostly unarmed in terms of firearms, but the impact of these under the last government and the current one is incredibly stressful for local communities. Is anyone in the Labour Party left wing anymore?  

"I want a Panopticon", but also "We don't have ICE raids here"?  

Am I missing the key step?  

These are all dehumanising tactics.

[First few comments has a "Get out, J". GI Robot mode activated.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRynLbEo/)  

For the record, Becca Balint (who is not named in the indexable text, unhelpfully) voted against a niche resolution that sought to criminalise the phrase, "from the river to the sea", arguing that it would unfairly weaponise antisemitism claims against Palestinians under active genocide. Becca Balint's family were Holocaust victims and survivors. Pam Bondi is a Nazi talking head. Pam Bondi can stfu.  

I am not yet able to forgive white goyim that enabled this dynamic; go fuck yourselves.

I will say this for free:  

After the genocide, I dropped the politeness after overextension, and a lot of people are somehow realising for the first time that I have brain cells in my skull.  

Interesting that we always pressure women to be polite, but only respect women when we're not polite.

The funny thing is, that simply because no one wanted to deal with a slightly awkward complaints with reasonable basis at a local level, we're now at "active international embarrasment" level.  

If Britain were to die, that's how we would go – too embarrassed to look at the hole in the bow, letting the ship sink rather than act.
