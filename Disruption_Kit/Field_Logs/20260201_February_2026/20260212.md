[For the record, I would consider tighter border controls, if they kept out rich white American paedophiles and rapists.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRygWxkD/)  

I said "consider"; I'm still not sure about boys drawing imaginary lines at all, really.  

I mean, when you think about it, it's fascinating that the same people who can respect a border, can't respect a "no", can't seem to work out that an unconscious person can't consent, or seem to think that consent from a teenager when they themselves are an adult, is valid.  

Again, if there were any consistency, I might be able to understand any of your points about these "borders".  

My vagina has a border, has it always been respected? Has immigration control always been given adequate enforcement powers?  

No, because many white men would rather end our species, than respect anyone else's power.  

It's as if they all think they have their own personal little nuclear mutual-destruction option, but no one's been down to maintain it, and it's questionable if the crew is even still alive down there.

That is an interview which will only be brushed aside at great peril; that is highly unusual and very serious.  

Americans: consult your nearest emotional support Briton for advice.
