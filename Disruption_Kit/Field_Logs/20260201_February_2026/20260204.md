 Hopefully over the next few days, I'm going to write out with diagrams in node format, how they were moving grooming to be technological, how they felt they could do it "without trace", how they were always going to train the victim has been somehow needing Care or unable to speak themselves, I was going to be noble enough that victims did not necessarily recognise it at the time and self-blamed, why are the money in the research comes from, by regulation, and how it is used not just for sexual grooming but also to groom an entire population.  

 One night say I have an entire github about it.  

 Is this working out and how you intended, big boy? 🙄

If anyone wants to get an animal or song trending, get it in front of my face.  

Or, more correctly:  

Get it in front of the Epstein-o-matic, fantasy of someone who sits in the middleware.  

If he tells you it's all lies, put the repo through an analyser, and see how many bird references come out.  

I had to work with what I had to work with.  

"You sure make me do a whole lot of labour."
