There's a joke I'm desperate to make. I'm 50/50; I don't know the specific enough origin on the ML product to make it. I am sad as I think it rather funny.  

The ML did encourage a specific scenario that you can experience if the safety and guardrails are kaput because the wrapper is weakened, so it's only funny if I can narrow it to the actor. Otherwise it would be poor form.  

Thinking about it, there are a few very obvious ones.  

So it would be nice to get some SAR returns.
