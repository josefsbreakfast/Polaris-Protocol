There's a joke I'm desperate to make. I'm 50/50; I don't know the specific enough origin on the ML product to make it. I am sad as I think it rather funny.  

The ML did encourage a specific scenario that you can experience if the safety and guardrails are kaput because the wrapper is weakened, so it's only funny if I can narrow it to the actor. Otherwise it would be poor form.  

Thinking about it, there are a few very obvious ones.  

So it would be nice to get some SAR returns.

really good example of prosocial nudge burnout. It's been really intense, and whilst I've been trying to get some sleep, I wouldn't have needed to sleep through the pits of the day that I did, have I just been left the fuck alone. This means that any useful nudges are lost within this sludge of absolute bullshit. To me, they look like they were some useful ones that were targeted, and then the rest was almost to make it unuseful.  

I'm now  doing things that I should've been able to do during the day, which ever prohibited on Shabbat, after candlelighting time. I'm not orthodox, so it's something that just... it just hurts to be made to do it by someone else, and it creates that feeling of not being enough or not being Jewish enough. This doesn't actually mean that I think it comes necessarily from a Jewish party. Just one who knows Jews very well.  

Something that I've learned through this experience is that there are a lot of alt right people, who have been taught by Jews who were scared of the Palestinian liberation movement, exactly how to be as cruel to Jews as possible.  

I am very aware that whoever is behind some of this, really wants me to be eyes and ears digitally within the green party for work to deal with divestment. this is really upsetting to me because I worked so hard with other people who are much more guilt than me, and did so much research to bring out not violations that come from the recent ICJ orders but also violations that come from Russian sanctions; it was clearly just an area where the information is presented in a complicated way and a lot of people were struggling with being compliant. I have a lot of patience for people who are overstretched in many areas of their work, and are willing to listen. The problem with this outside interference all the time is that I can't do the work that I want to do, and making sure that we are compliant as possible with the ICJ orders, even if we pass over the very obvious ethical portion, save our country money in the future and we will be convicted and charged financially. In this regard, what I am doing is good home economics. What the people who are interfering with my work work are doing, is anti-democratic and against the British state.  

I am sick and tired of having to have conversations about British interests. Is it really in the interest of the British state? Or is it in the interest of a small group of individuals who seek to bully the British state, who seek to lobby it, just as they did with the sugar lobby, just as they did with the tobacco lobby... the list goes on and on. My country and my country's government are not a kitty, for you to finance your own island, where laws and ethics don't apply. This is my country money, it is my country's labour. Get the fuck out of everyone's way.  

People who see themselves as real capsules do their self sabotaging behaviour all the time. People would tolerate this for longer if you weren't just so  exploitative. A lot of people will give a lot, so when they get sick and tired, it's often just because you have taken way too much from them.  

so I need to go and apologise to G-d again for buying my dinner after sundown, and I probably will be working across this day because apparently, let's nudge the Jew over Shabbat. Something that really pisses me off about the way in which the Israeli stare and its allies conduct its business, is that your cat things like COGAT having Shabbat off because it allows them to not allow goods into a starving population who are behind in a legal wall on a Friday and a Saturday, but they never apply to all the Jewish people who are just trying to follow the laws of Judaism.  

We don't really have the same concept of sin as Christianity, but what we are doing to Palestinians, and the investments around this, are extremely trief.  

This is why you see so many ultra orthodox Jews who will not engage as far as possible with the state directly, even if they live in the land of Palestine, even if they live under the portion which is called the state of Israel.  

I look at how I was before, and sometimes I question how I honestly thought anybof this was legitimate. I want to clarify for anyone reading this, I am not necessarily saying what should happen with the state and I am not necessarily saying that anything bad should happen to Jewish people who live on that land. I am saying that this way the state behaves is completely illegitimate, and proves its own illegitimacy to governance. They use the holocaust as rhetoric all the time. This act is extremely abusive, and extremely ironic given the states own history, as well as its current actions, in respect both to Palestinian people, and to the diaspora.  

I really wish People would stop looking at this and think this is how Jews are. looking at their behaviour, and assuming that that is okay, puts a really big red flag to me that you believe the stereotypes of old school European antisemitism. Because if you think I kill babies that much, then you are accepting some level of the blood libel story, that Jews kill babies sacrilegiously. If you believe that my dealings with money is a Dune look like that, then you have to believe in the stereotypes you've been shown that I'm a crook, and then I'm an exploiter, greater than a European (which to be fair, is a fairly high bar).  

I also completely understand why a state which bases itself on some Jewish identity, would play into stereotypes, because of who its dealing with.  

This whole setup has completely broken the religiosity of the Jewish people.  

And it has come out of European colonialism, European racism both in respect to people in Palestine as well as in respect to Jews in Europe.  

The entire business is extremely damning to how white people in Europe view us.  

And because of that history, because it's never been fully dismantled, and because you leaned into it so fucking much for the last three years, every single second that you refuse to hold a accountability to the men who are involved in Epstein's network (and any women, anyone involved), you are bouldering everyone to engage in some of the most violent horrific antisemitic tropes.  

And because of this history, because of how we have transferred it onto Muslims like copy and paste, you are not only signing the death warrant of every single Jew in the European and western diaspora; you are also signing the death war of every single Muslim in that diaspora for as well.  

A holocaust does not pick one group, it picks a Court group to start with, and it doesn't always just start with that when it comes to the killing; you are all collectively setting up the next European genocide. you are setting it up by allowing so many people to be racialised and treated like shit because you cannot hold our accountability to your own fellow white men. If you do not hold this accountability and transparency, the population of large are going to vote after the usual scapegoats, and let me tell you now that Epstein and all of that a lot, would've had no problem in that happening to the general population. It doesn't matter that Epstein was Jewish. He was also a huge hypocritical Cunt, you only cared about his self interest. And a lot of of his friends were exactly the fucking same. You cannot allow them anywhere near power, because this is exactly what they will allow, rather than go and be in front of a judge themselves.  

Look at Trump. That is a man so bend on avoiding Court, that he has literally tearing apart a country. He is doing this all because he doesn't want to go to Court. These people fear exposure, they fear transparency, and that is exactly why that processing itself, is punishment enough for them.  
They cannot handle the shame of what they have done, and so allowing them to avoid it, is the biggest biggest mistake we can make.  

You wonder why women are treated so badly now. You wonder why the racism in this country and across Europe is horrific. You wonder why we have demonise trans people in queer people this much. We have done this all out of control, and we have been allowed to do it and facilitated to do it by not holding these people accountable.  

If anyone really gives a fuck about saving the wet, you must perform some sort of justice in this. It is too public, the crimes of affected society fault too much. The anger that the demo feels has to go somewhere. I really don't want it to become violent against anyone that they classify into the groups of people they have been taught to hate. Because by the way, it never stops at the group itself, and people are not really checking your ancestry.com, when it comes to being violent and seeking retribution because they feel that their children are under threat.  

Humans do really fucking stupid shit when they think their children are under threat, and why wouldn't they? We would all do pretty stupid things that we wouldn't normally do if we were scared for our children's safety.  
I am begging you all not to allow the circumstances that we would hope are in the past, to continue to repeat themselves.  

When I say I am anti-genocide, you have to understand: genocides do not tend to self contain. Once we accept one, once we say yes to one, we give permission to the process as a whole.  

I am sick and tired of People braiding me, because I say the state of Israel is acting like a bunch of twats. It should never matter who you are, genocide should always be resisted. I have seen too many children decapitated in the last three years, to give a single fuck about how polite I need to be; clearly not enough people listen to politeness. And so my resistance will no longer be polite.  

if your first thought Mr. Characterise me as a hysteric Jewish woman, the trope you are using comes from Victorian England. It has 1000 year history in this continent. It is what makes you think that I would be a wonderful mother, as well as a whore in bed, to a greater extent than any other white woman. I know you can't abandon it tomorrow, because these tropes are developed over a long time in our heads. I do need you to critically think, recognise that your head is lapping to a cultural lie, and grant me a little bit more credulity, when you read what I am saying.  

I also need you to understand, that a country or a state will always act in the states interests, before it acts in People's interests. It should not surprise you that a state that depends on Jewish migration, does not call out or address, and in some ways promotes and accepts, very common forms of hatred against Jewish people outside of its state.  

If I cannot find safety here, there is a greater chance I will seek safety there.  

The reason that this is so pertinent to Jewish women in particular, is that a Jewish tradition and an Jewish law, you need a Jewish womb to make a Jewish child.  

This is so ingrained, but even a lot of secular Jewish men, will still kind of want to have their children with a Jewish woman, even if they generally hate her.  

Zionism requires patriarchy to function.  

Stereotypes of Jewish women therefore, are hardly ever addressed, to the country, they are often kindled in the diaspora.  

It is never just about racial supremacy, because you always need women to implement racial supremacy, and so you need them to have genuine fear for the men they are living along alongside.  

Add in the reality of Jewish law, and I will never be free under Zionism.  

instead, I will have the very worst stereotypes of Jewish women reiterated, because doing something in the diaspora in particular, it is very much in the states interest to continue existing.  

Why would we choose Jewish women, over the interest of the Jewish state?  

For absolute clarity, I'm not saying that a state predominant religion can't be Judaism. I am saying that the current project, keeps Jewish women under the control of Jewish men, and will accept brutality towards Jewish women before it will accept dismantling the state.  

White men are the very worst barometers for this, because you are supposed to be the foil that we are scared of, that makes us turn to Jewish men for safety, even when we are held in this patriarchy.  

In what appears to be very paradoxical to white men... the men that are hated by their system, demonised by this system, are actually far more likely to speak in our interests, as Jewish women. And it's not even because they desire a sexually. It's because they're talking to the same root problem. Because Zionist is also very racist, in its full function and form.  
Palestinian men have done more for Jewish women's freedom, then Jewish men have a century.  

I need a lot of you to start thinking, that it is indeed possible that my practice is more about a logic and lived experience, than "shes got a thing for brown men".  

I really need you to consider that this might be a lot more about the liberation of my people, than anything to do with my libido.  

For anyone who is shocked that I am saying it, it is incredibly obvious to me when I speak to white men and I speak to Jewish men that for them, this has a lot to do with possession of Jewish women.  

I am not your Jewess.
