[British local authority incompetence has gone global, which really was only a matter of time.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPLJKnK/)  
British bureaucracy was made as a colonial institution; it was made to only ever run if you were the "right sort", or appropriately bribed.  
It has only ever worked for the demos in the past, and in the present, where there are amazing humans making overrides on a regular basis, often at great risk to themselves.  
This is literally a system which was not built to help, it was built to contain grievance.  
It has only ever been functional when there were good people inside it who actively worked around it.  
Reform's DOGE attempted efficiency costs, and even they failed; the system is not a 21st century system.  

Canada imported a British colonial system of bureaucracy; there is good reason to look at the overlap.  

Every system of bureaucracy which was imported from the British system, can be used as a comparison, and something you can see in common to them all is that if you are not able to bypass the actual processes, you will not be able to engage in the democracy.  

Again, this doesn't mean that there aren't some wonderful people in these systems who do everything they can, often without realising what they're doing is working against an imperial system, in order to soften the impacts of that imperial system. There are a lot of people have done a lot of work to make sure that the public who are within their remit, are looked after as far as possible; they may not be aware that they were just protecting them from the system.  

You can get angry about us talking about decolonisation as a poor white person, but please do be aware that we are trying to get rid of and replace the apparatus which hurts you too, or the very least, force it to treat you like a human.  

Local government replaced in part Victorian poor boards and workhouse committees; what did we all expect?   

When you "trim the fat", by going through austerity, you can see this for exactly what it is: at its core, our society functions in exactly the same way it did 200 years ago.  

Everything that was protecting us from the core system has been taken out.  

Do we still want to keep this system?
