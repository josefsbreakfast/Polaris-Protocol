[British local authority incompetence has gone global, which really was only a matter of time.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPLJKnK/)  
British bureaucracy was made as a colonial institution; it was made to only ever run if you were the "right sort", or appropriately bribed.  
It has only ever worked for the demos in the past, and in the present, where there are amazing humans making overrides on a regular basis, often at great risk to themselves.  
This is literally a system which was not built to help, it was built to contain grievance.  
It has only ever been functional when there were good people inside it who actively worked around it.  
Reform's DOGE attempted efficiency costs, and even they failed; the system is not a 21st century system.
