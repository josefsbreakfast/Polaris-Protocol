<!--We had a false fire alarm, so I'm awake now.-->
[British local authority incompetence has gone global, which really was only a matter of time.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPLJKnK/)  
British bureaucracy was made as a colonial institution; it was made to only ever run if you were the "right sort", or appropriately bribed.  
It has only ever worked for the demos in the past, and in the present, where there are amazing humans making overrides on a regular basis, often at great risk to themselves.  
This is literally a system which was not built to help, it was built to contain grievance.  
It has only ever been functional when there were good people inside it who actively worked around it.  
Reform's DOGE attempted efficiency costs, and even they failed; the system is not a 21st century system.  

Canada imported a British colonial system of bureaucracy; there is good reason to look at the overlap.  

Every system of bureaucracy which was imported from the British system, can be used as a comparison, and something you can see in common to them all is that if you are not able to bypass the actual processes, you will not be able to engage in the democracy.  

Again, this doesn't mean that there aren't some wonderful people in these systems who do everything they can, often without realising what they're doing is working against an imperial system, in order to soften the impacts of that imperial system. There are a lot of people have done a lot of work to make sure that the public who are within their remit, are looked after as far as possible; they may not be aware that they were just protecting them from the system.  

You can get angry about us talking about decolonisation as a poor white person, but please do be aware that we are trying to get rid of and replace the apparatus which hurts you too, or the very least, force it to treat you like a human.  

Local government replaced in part Victorian poor boards and workhouse committees; what did we all expect?   

When you "trim the fat", by going through austerity, you can see this for exactly what it is: at its core, our society functions in exactly the same way it did 200 years ago.  

Everything that was protecting us from the core system has been taken out.  

Do we still want to keep this system?  

In the UK, it literally does not matter if we replace the political element; it is the system itself, which is a problem.  

I refer everyone again to many years of reading Rotten Boroughs in Private Eye. The system is working exactly how it has been designed.  

This is what a colonial state does to the people in its home territory, within the imperial core; your race, the colour of your skin, none of that shit matters, because the system hates us all.  

This doesn't get better with top down restructure; you give local people real power or you burn the whole thing down.  

Fascism is merely an extension of capitalism, imperialism, white supremacy, and patriarchy; fascism is not an unsurprising end-point of the systems, because it is how they always express themselves under strain.

[The Met Police are now formally asking former Royal Protection Officers to come forward with any information they may have.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPLLgVR/) This is HUGE.

On policing, it should be noted that there's a lot of difference in opinion, and a lot of wide discussion when it comes to people who are interested in or embody principles of abolitionism.  

We cannot literally "come and get you", until the forces that mean that you don't really police for people, but often police for profit, are weakened.  

It's not that everybody is really happy when you get injured; it's that you have been placed to resist any democratic action, and a standing in between the demos, and the tyranny.  

No one actually has to have an opinion about your personal motivations or character, to realise that what needs to change is that we have to be able to weaken the forces that are putting you in that position, before we can ever "bring you along for the ride" to liberation.  

I appreciate that there is a huge psychic toll, and how you were therefore come into a depersonalised concept of "the police", especially when, for instance, we talk about the need to, "fuck the police".  

The workers, and the underclasses more widely, have so few options in order to resist; I'm not sure how this can be overcome, without genuinely losing momentum, at this point.  

Many of us know that you are highly incentivised to dehumanise others; we understand that it's about incentivise you, to act in a way that demobilises us.  

We could say that it's time for that conversation, but really the best time will be when industry is weaker in this country, in respect to pulling the strings of policing, in order to avoid the opinions or the emotions held by the workers.  

It's incredibly difficult to invest the amount of time and energy that is required from a resources point of view, after the 1% of had 15 years of austerity, and now has a PM that's essentially an arms industry plant.  

There are also a lot of people who've been so deeply hurt by the way that policing has happened in this country, and the impact it's had on them personally all the people that they love, that they really cannot come to the table yet, and may not be able to come to the table in the imminent future.  

That doesn't necessarily mean if there's anything wrong with them, but it does mean that they may express their anger in ways that they're upsetting to you; might I suggest you let them express their grief and their anger.  

When we hold in our emotions, they've been through our hearts. Sometimes an expressive posture is the safest posture, even when it feels threatening.

[And this is why "spiking laws" will never change anything in isolation; we all know how normal this is and what will happen if the wrong strings are pulled if we say something.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPLRgau/)  

This is incredibly normal in the UK, too. At both of my university experiences, including the one where we were going to be doctors, the people who tried to report sexual harassment or sexual misconduct against them (including gay men), were treated as if they had done something wrong, and anyone who was actually doing the sexual violence was protected. There were male students who later became doctors, who were actively protected by universities. universities I went to are not connected and are in completely different parts of the country.  

This is why so many survivors are telling you, that there is essentially so much to risk when you report, that in many cases we are only reporting when we feel like we have to.  

[And by the way? It is very often women who do that protection.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPL18V6/)  

Most of us have partake in that before, to some degree, and it would be really good if as a group we could stop allowing men to use us against each other.

[Adding also that THERE ARE CREDIBLE CONCERNS RAISED THAT BRITISH VETERANS MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE IDF UTILISING BRITISH RECON AND THE INTERCONNECTED TECH WHICH WE HABE CONTRACTS WITH but yeah, sure, it's tired members of the public who have exhaused democratic means that are the problem.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPL2fmw/)  

The IDF is a bit of a bugger for not really investigating itself properly, and it's also a bit of a bugger for not being honest with its allies, whenever there's a military death. This has happened in Lebanon with an Irish peacekeeper in recent years (where the IDF has been occupying force in the local territory), and it has happened in Gaza with British ex-serviceman (WCK vehicle).  

There is an awful thought to talk about, because the presence of either of those parties is not necessarily in keeping with Palestinian wishes, so when I talk about them, I'm really talking about this from a British-centric viewpoint.  

If you really give a shit about veterans, why are you okay with the fact that the IDF has never given any explanation that makes any sense, for the World Central kitchen workers being shot out and killed?  

Again, if what you are trying to avoid is being antisemitic, this isn't really a good enough excuse; if I was very close by when someone shot and killed some of your friends, I would kind of expect you to ask me questions.  

And what do you know... my dictation is now disabled.  

The IDF was in the area. The IDF frequently claims to have appropriate ground control. The IDF claims its technology, and that of any contractors, is highly precise.  

So why did we lose a vehicle of ex-servicemen, apparantly doing COGAT-compliant humanitarian work?  

Why did one of the fathers find out, essentially watching the news, seeing his son's body bag on TV?
