So I think something really interesting exists, which might explain why the UK engaged in a very particular way around a particular issue, which it is still currently not on the right side of its own domestic law on.  

Ever since I said all of the stuff that I said about the book, and talked about that author in relation to Palestine and to counterterrorism and antizionism, something quite interesting as come up on my feed.  
Because somebody clearly thinks that I still belong to the state of Israel and I'm currently its property (G-d bring forward the liberation, my days), someone's running this story of looping back to this email from 2022.  

Which I love, because it really shows that that email was a lot more planned out than it's ever been admitted. Emailing question, is apparently a "drunk email", according to this narrative that is permeating the feed currently. That's really interesting, because it is proposing sexual activity, defining a time place and location that puts the sender at a very specific policing encounter terrorism conference in 2022, but in addition to that, I appreciate that the man is Scottish and basically from a foreign country in that regard, but are you honestly telling me that when this person is drunk, if they do drink, they sound like a native Hebrew speaker, speaking colonial Gulf school style English, from the Negev?  

I obviously can't say for definite, it's not my specialism, but that's what it sounds like, and that's actually really difficult to replicate if you're really drunk, and a native English speaker; if this is this man making a drunk email, I think we at least have to take our hat off for how much he sounds like a Mossad agent from a very specific generation, because that's quite impressive.  
Especially for a guy who isn't Jewish.  

Again, I appreciate Glasweigan is a little tricky if you're not used to anything about the M25, but I really don't feel like they're complete foreigners to the UK. 
I would really like someone to offer the explanation to any of what I'm looking at, from an official position, because right now I am living in the universe where I have to accept that my Jewish brothers genuinely thought this was a good idea; or, as depressingly, "owed to the favour".  

I'm embarrassed on behalf of the whole house, if this is the case.  

Dear White People Who Are Very Lost:  
There is certain groups in generations who are more likely to have been taught Hebrew from a very young age, compared to someone who will have been speaking a lot of English, or other languages like Russian. I'm going to leave the story of language in that state at that, if you're new here.  

The important thing that I need to convey to you is that this is sounds a lot like this has been constructed by a native Semitic language speaker, and it's being subscribed to someone who is not that. Specifically for me and my experience, and I am not an expert, this sounds like someone who grew up in the Negev in the 60s or 70s, and the majority of their learn English was in the form that is in many different territories which used to have British colonial presence, a lot of those schools have a specific style to them, so you could really limit down exactly who it is from the text.  
The idea that we're supposed to believe that some lad from Glasgow can replicate that whilst under the influence of anything, is very funny to me.  

I feel like I'm skirting so much on the Northern/Scottish humour bridge here, but if this person drinks alcohol, I just can't imagine large parts of the email being very specifically constructed and I'm very precise diplomacy English manner, and then part of it being a copy and paste a bad list, and not having any corrections when as we have pointed out this person putting multiple indexes with notes. Does that seem like the same person to you?  

Additionally, even if I think that it was "real", I don't understand why I'm supposed to give a fuck; white men send or say worse than this to my face on a regular basis. I feel like some of you really don't understand how bad the sexism problem in most industries is; white men say it rather than write it so that they never get caught doing it.  

I can promise you now, the vast majority of any racialised men are absolutely terrified to speak to me, period, because of how much fear has been driven into them by white men parading themselves around as if they're really hurt by the fact that no one wants to fuck them, even though they keep having lots of opinions about doing violence to women and also doing violence to any men who are effeminite; they are not acting like people who want to continue their species.  

I bring this up, especially with the book, because there appears to be some sort of gatekeeping mechanism potentially by a few people slightly removed from each other, which appears to be gatekeeping a significant part of my identity, likeness, continuously acting against my interests and particularly to other parties, which I'm not really understanding who that is or why they think they've got the authority to do so.  

The fact that they keep trying to point it towards just being an Israeli problem, really does make me think that there's a lot more white men involved, who really just want this to look like a Jewish into communal problem, when would it really is is white man benefiting from the fact that we still have a fair degree of antisemitism in this country.  

I mean, I'm just guessing, but the way in which this is being done is not just Canary mission, there is that element to what's happening, but there is 100% part of this where there are white men who think they know everything about Jews, who absolutely don't.  

During one of my healthcare appointments, for absolutely no reason, I was asked a number of questions which essentially try to give some of the argument that you would use in Beit Din, but just not in my specific circumstances from the information that was already known.  
The information would've already been known to British estate security in the right part of it, so this again points down to some very specific parties.  
When you look at annoying white men who have been hanging around the Jewish community like a bad smell, there's only so many faces.  

They're all cut from the same fucking cloth.  

This particular cluster, also sits very close to law, defence, intelligence, surveillance, and some very specific areas of the Islands, in particular.  
This is why we don't trust people when they say they want to represent our interests, unless they start actually representing our fucking interests, where we are the ones who are leading, and they actually listen to the stuff that doesn't also benefit them.  

"You're not a colleague – you're a fucking coloniser."  

Quite literally, or so I've heard.  

This is the same email that's almost certainly misinterpreted a bit of data exhaust, and filled in the blanks with their own genital insecurities. Men are terribly funny to me.  

Bet you're wishing you hadn't started poaching my lawyers now, aren't you?  

& to be absolutely fair to my brothers and sisters who are of a more Zionist disposition: they may not actually feel that they own me per se, so much as they are...*in custody of access to me*.  

This is particularly annoying, because the person(s) who is responsible here, absolutely shouldn't be fucking around with my data and my shit anyway.  

I'm an adult, not a child; get me a lawyer. Not a shit one like some of you, a better one.

I'm not plucking Israeli intelligence firms out of nowhere: I'm Jewish and technically fall under some portions of Israeli law if you really forced it to fit, I continuously geolocate to where Unit 8200 is most likely present, I get very strange responses to legal correspondence when I clarify my nationality, and there appears to be something OSA-like in the way of significant portions of my data.  

And, after the week of the 20 foot penis, it is only been very, very recently, that my TikTok feed does not contain a very strange mixture of dark romance fantasy paired with Ottoman history, to the point where this looks so specifically fetishised, for a very specific mindset. This would be whilst we were watching lots of audit videos from Palestine protests, and checking who is getting arrested comments who hadn't gotten arrested, who had had complaints at work, who had not had complaints at work... you get the idea.  

I appreciate that that's not definitive evidence, but it did make quite an impression on me.  

Thank you to the State of Israel for a kink none of us really needed. Am Yisrael Chai.  

The white men from policy, can read Project Esther, and imagine what the Internet would do with that information, and you've basically got the entire thing.  

None of you are Mordecai in this. I just want to clarify: none of you. You get the triangle heads. Do better.

Am I worth this level of spend? Only if you did something very expensive and profitable with my data.  

Do you know who is probably worth that amount of spend to get them to shut the fuck up?  

Yeah. Exactly.  

I am merely the accessory, Esther.  

Whoever did this to one of the Matriarchs needs to have a serious fucking look in the mirror.  

You have clearly forgotten how you came into this world, and the gender of the human beings most likely to help you depart from it, lest you piss them off too much.  

I'm telling you: there are men in this world, who are acting like they do not want the species to continue. They're like lemmings but they spread it to everyone else.

[This is the mentality of the Project Esther crowd, incidently; they are not using us to protect us.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJrc6Q/)

Oh, yup. The Men™️ are upset.  

Awwww.  

It's not my fault your forgeries are so bad.

So I got a few additional "dig" videos, but now what I'm getting is life advice for men, about what women actually like, and telling me that it's not about my money or my abs, and essentially explaining to me to be a well-rounded human being.  

This is happened so many times before and I just think it's always so funny.  

It's like the algorithm is really trying to help them, and it's really confused about which one of us is which.  

(I got mirrored a lot by one of the surveillance parties; there's been a few sources.)

Whilst this all does suggest some very serious business, I just want to point out something cultural.  

If you did set up a system like this, where you essentially police acces to a Jew on behalf of a white man, all Medinat Israel would need to do is send a text to itself being like, "hey babe, what up", to play on white male possession and jealousy.  

It would be so easy, looking at the man and how he reacts to other men, to have him lose his shit at another man for... your wind up.  

The world is deeply racist, and we are not always considered white. The state was built on counterinsurgency brought over from the British attempt to put down the IRA (as in, what is now the Army of ROI). It isn't surprising to me when I see this, partially because when you are always treated like you're *going* to be dublicitous, it starts shaping how you act, in part because why would you bother acting above the standard they set for you?  

What is fascinating, is how white men continue to fall for things like this; we do often play in your faces, and the state does it as much as some of us do it individually. This is a core part of many strands of humour by groups in a power dynamic like this. This is what makes the dual relationship that the Medinat finds itself in (both oppressed by whiteness but also a force of white supremacy, chiefly targeting the indigenous population of Palestine, wherever they are), is strange to watch.  

It's like looking at someone who deeply inderstands the game, and yet continue to enact it and pretend they don't understand fairness or rules when applied to someone else.  

This is actually one of the key failures of much of the lawfare that seeks to (supposedly) promote Israel's interests: if we resist like oppressed people towards whiteness, we cannot claim we do not know what Palestinians are going through; our cultural intimacy with exile, oppression, and genocide, only incriminates us further if we continue to advance this narrative.  
Far more useful to atrocity prevention going forward, would be to understand why that cycle of violence perpetuated, often simutaneously, and how to interrupt our own actions which contribute to the ongoing mismatch between the promise and the reality.  

I also find it bizarre that you wouldn't want to repossess European lands; do you not think it's interesting, which countries support this colonisation process?  

All those who quietly took the land when people left.  

But you know. Keep putting sticks in the spokes of the bike, I guess.

[This was the same line Mandelson gave, so, no, I don't think ot's good enough.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJReuE/) I also just think a lot of people do not understand, in some cases rather willingly, how many rapes are NFA'd. It's one of the most common crimes where nothing happens, and this is almost entirely system failure; private convictions get results.  

Britain chooses to only partially criminalise SV.

[Meanwhile, this is what a male ally looks like.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRf1chxy/)

[Or: they are genuinely confused about where their leak is.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJ9ACa/) we are in the middle of something that has happened in waves, within the last few years; I don't mean to alarm you, but we are in the middle of a coordinated antidemocratic action.  

This is most likely, enlarge part, being done through digital nudging and covert surveillance.  

Given that the UK is currently holding some accountability over Epstein files actions, and that directly implicates both the United States and Israel, and ultimately threatens any of the last 20 years of what I likely Russian state actions against the UK... oh, and the alt right is here for the ride, but let's be honest they're mostly being used by more powerful men...  

The UK is as significant risk currently, and we've never had a conversation about this, so we're not actually that prepared for how to handle it; this is a novel threat to us as a country.  

it's not actually that important to understand who externally is acting upon us, as much as it is to understand what seems odd, and prod whether or not that looks like there is a benefit that is not clear and obvious at the surface. 

I've spent 2 million words writing about this, and I appreciate that some of it really sucks, but I'm hopeful that at least some of this might be useful, if this is all very scary and very new.  

These actions have happened towards the Palestinian advocacy community in this country, Black and brown people in this country, as well as the trans community in this country, and towards survivors of sexual violence in this country and whistleblowers, as well as disabled people and neurodiverse people. All of these people have been impacted by the same mechanisms that are currently being used.  

We are literally in a place where if you don't listen to survivors of these issues, there is a really good chance that you will lose this country to Vladimir Putin or Steve Bannon, or such similar force of testosterone-flavoured ridiculousness.  

I appreciate these are all the "categories" of people that we have been told to hate for several years now, but they are literally your canaries and your Cassandras; ignore at your own peril.  

Personally, I cannot be arsed to learn Russian grammar; it is incredibly complicated, past a certain point.  

I mean, fuck, if you'd rather have a physical book then read this... I mean, I probably know one, for this exact problem. Weird, that.  

Gosh, I wonder why there was such an interest to suppress it.  

---

If you want the really easy line in response to basically any news story:  
But what will we do, about the revelations from the Epstein files, which suggests that there may be a similar problem of abuse of power and tolerated practices of sexual violence and trafficking, in the UK?  

That's the line.  

If you want to knock it up or not you can start pointing out that a lot of the Epstein files conversations, I directly relevant to not just problems in the UK, but also to specific political events of instability, of currency devaluation, and that several men are named who are not being asked questions.  

Believe me, I can go on.  

If we want to move into the new century, we need to clean house.  

[There are continually more names coming out, across different jurisdictions; the DOJ is deliberately stalling.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJQEeF/) apart from how horrific this is for survivors, this is not a political scandal that will go away for Britain, so in the interest that we actually get any of the other things done that we need to get done, it does suit our national interest to just clear house of any men and any women who are currently in office and are also part of the problem.  

It also suits our national interest, to start putting in robust surveillance laws, which limit the capacity for this to be misused as information in this country, and which limit the capacity for companies to basically extort us, should they come across information which is incriminating and suggest that the British state did not take appropriate action, according to it its own laws.  

Yes: I am suggesting that we need to know who the people are who are obstructing democratic process, and a facilitating criminal action, and I am stating that given the information that has been disclosed into the public domain, in part by the DOJ disclosures, but also in several statements from people mentioned in those files, you are part of our own ecosystem, as well as the various different scandals that we have had in our own country, that we have an active bipartisan problem, where there are people who benefit from this situation, who will be very difficult to remove, and you ultimately are acting as gatekeepers for the rest of the British establishment apparatus.  

That's really unhealthy.  

We need to clean house.
