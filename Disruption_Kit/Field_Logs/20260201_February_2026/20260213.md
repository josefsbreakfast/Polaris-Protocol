So I think something really interesting exists, which might explain why the UK engaged in a very particular way around a particular issue, which it is still currently not on the right side of its own domestic law on.  

Ever since I said all of the stuff that I said about the book, and talked about that author in relation to Palestine and to counterterrorism and antizionism, something quite interesting as come up on my feed.  
Because somebody clearly thinks that I still belong to the state of Israel and I'm currently its property (G-d bring forward the liberation, my days), someone's running this story of looping back to this email from 2022.  

Which I love, because it really shows that that email was a lot more planned out than it's ever been admitted. Emailing question, is apparently a "drunk email", according to this narrative that is permeating the feed currently. That's really interesting, because it is proposing sexual activity, defining a time place and location that puts the sender at a very specific policing encounter terrorism conference in 2022, but in addition to that, I appreciate that the man is Scottish and basically from a foreign country in that regard, but are you honestly telling me that when this person is drunk, if they do drink, they sound like a native Hebrew speaker, speaking colonial Gulf school style English, from the Negev?  

I obviously can't say for definite, it's not my specialism, but that's what it sounds like, and that's actually really difficult to replicate if you're really drunk, and a native English speaker; if this is this man making a drunk email, I think we at least have to take our hat off for how much he sounds like a Mossad agent from a very specific generation, because that's quite impressive.  
Especially for a guy who isn't Jewish.  

Again, I appreciate Glasweigan is a little tricky if you're not used to anything about the M25, but I really don't feel like they're complete foreigners to the UK. 
I would really like someone to offer the explanation to any of what I'm looking at, from an official position, because right now I am living in the universe where I have to accept that my Jewish brothers genuinely thought this was a good idea; or, as depressingly, "owed to the favour".  

I'm embarrassed on behalf of the whole house, if this is the case.  

Dear White People Who Are Very Lost:  
There is certain groups in generations who are more likely to have been taught Hebrew from a very young age, compared to someone who will have been speaking a lot of English, or other languages like Russian. I'm going to leave the story of language in that state at that, if you're new here.  

The important thing that I need to convey to you is that this is sounds a lot like this has been constructed by a native Semitic language speaker, and it's being subscribed to someone who is not that. Specifically for me and my experience, and I am not an expert, this sounds like someone who grew up in the Negev in the 60s or 70s, and the majority of their learn English was in the form that is in many different territories which used to have British colonial presence, a lot of those schools have a specific style to them, so you could really limit down exactly who it is from the text.  
The idea that we're supposed to believe that some lad from Glasgow can replicate that whilst under the influence of anything, is very funny to me.  

I feel like I'm skirting so much on the Northern/Scottish humour bridge here, but if this person drinks alcohol, I just can't imagine large parts of the email being very specifically constructed and I'm very precise diplomacy English manner, and then part of it being a copy and paste a bad list, and not having any corrections when as we have pointed out this person putting multiple indexes with notes. Does that seem like the same person to you?  

Additionally, even if I think that it was "real", I don't understand why I'm supposed to give a fuck; white men send or say worse than this to my face on a regular basis. I feel like some of you really don't understand how bad the sexism problem in most industries is; white men say it rather than write it so that they never get caught doing it.  

I can promise you now, the vast majority of any racialised men are absolutely terrified to speak to me, period, because of how much fear has been driven into them by white men parading themselves around as if they're really hurt by the fact that no one wants to fuck them, even though they keep having lots of opinions about doing violence to women and also doing violence to any men who are effeminite; they are not acting like people who want to continue their species.  

I bring this up, especially with the book, because there appears to be some sort of gatekeeping mechanism potentially by a few people slightly removed from each other, which appears to be gatekeeping a significant part of my identity, likeness, continuously acting against my interests and particularly to other parties, which I'm not really understanding who that is or why they think they've got the authority to do so.  

The fact that they keep trying to point it towards just being an Israeli problem, really does make me think that there's a lot more white men involved, who really just want this to look like a Jewish into communal problem, when would it really is is white man benefiting from the fact that we still have a fair degree of antisemitism in this country.  

I mean, I'm just guessing, but the way in which this is being done is not just Canary mission, there is that element to what's happening, but there is 100% part of this where there are white men who think they know everything about Jews, who absolutely don't.  

During one of my healthcare appointments, for absolutely no reason, I was asked a number of questions which essentially try to give some of the argument that you would use in Beit Din, but just not in my specific circumstances from the information that was already known.  
The information would've already been known to British estate security in the right part of it, so this again points down to some very specific parties.  
When you look at annoying white men who have been hanging around the Jewish community like a bad smell, there's only so many faces.  

They're all cut from the same fucking cloth.  

This particular cluster, also sits very close to law, defence, intelligence, surveillance, and some very specific areas of the Islands, in particular.  
This is why we don't trust people when they say they want to represent our interests, unless they start actually representing our fucking interests, where we are the ones who are leading, and they actually listen to the stuff that doesn't also benefit them.  

"You're not a colleague – you're a fucking coloniser."  

Quite literally, or so I've heard.  

This is the same email that's almost certainly misinterpreted a bit of data exhaust, and filled in the blanks with their own genital insecurities. Men are terribly funny to me.  

Bet you're wishing you hadn't started poaching my lawyers now, aren't you?  

& to be absolutely fair to my brothers and sisters who are of a more Zionist disposition: they may not actually feel that they owe me, so much as they are...*in custody of access to me*.  

This is particularly annoying, because the person(s) who is responsible here, absolutely shouldn't be fucking around with my data and my shit anyway.  

I'm an adult, not a child; get me a lawyer. Not a shit one like some of you, a better one.
