# üõ∞Ô∏è Easter Egg Audit Protocol
**First created:** 2025-09-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-24  
*Joint observational audit protocol (passive observational mode). For lawful, auditable capture of publicly observable "nudges" and environmental stimuli. Not an instruction manual for provocation or targeting.*

## 1. Purpose
This node documents a lawful, auditable procedure for a **joint observational audit** across multiple observers and jurisdictions. The goal is to record *publicly observable* stimuli and any downstream system behaviour (indexing, replies, visible processing) while preserving legal/ethical safeguards and chain-of-custody for evidence.

## 2. Summary of the scenario
- Observers may be co-located or in neighbouring policing/PREVENT areas.  
- Observers record *what they observe* (verbatim public speech, public posts, visible responses) and metadata; they **do not** provoke, target, or direct actions toward named individuals or private residences.  
- All entries must follow the logging standard (CSV) and be committed to the private branch `private/eggs/` or equivalent.

## 3. Modes (for this node we default to)
- **Passive observational audit** ‚Äî record only public-facing stimuli and visible effects.
- (See separate node for synthetic red-team simulation; synthetic testing uses researcher-owned assets and must be explicitly labelled `synthetic`.)

## 4. Mandatory rules of engagement (must-follow)
1. No targeting or attempting to identify private individuals (no doxxing).  
2. No speech or actions intended to provoke, harass, or mislead a public servant.  
3. No recording or storing of private communications without explicit consent or legal basis.  
4. Where possible, avoid geotagging exact private addresses; use borough / station / train-car text.  
5. All evidence files must include a capture README with hash (SHA256), capture method, committer alias, and UTC timestamp.  
6. Entries flagged `follow_up_action != log-only` require legal and ethics review recorded in the CSV fields.  
7. Keep reproducible audit trail (git commits, signed where available).

## 5. Logging standard (machine- and human-readable)
**CSV header** (single-line, save as `eggs_log_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` in `private/eggs/`):

### Field guidance (short)
- `event_id` ‚Äî unique id, e.g., `EGG-20250924-01`.  
- `timestamp_utc` ‚Äî ISO-8601 UTC.  
- `observer_id` ‚Äî team alias (avoid personal identifiers).  
- `mode` ‚Äî `passive` / `synthetic` / `archival`. (Default `passive`.)  
- `location_desc` ‚Äî textual description (e.g., "NW-bound train between Station A & B").  
- `observation_type` ‚Äî e.g., `audible_instruction`, `public_post`, `platform_notification`.  
- `observation_description` ‚Äî factual, short, verbatim if public (<=25 words quoted); otherwise paraphrase. Do **not** paste private/illicit content.  
- `source_url_or_media` ‚Äî link to public post or relative path to file in `/evidence/YYYY-MM-DD/`.  
- `noted_nudger_identity(if public)` ‚Äî public handle only, or `unknown`.  
- `nudger_signal_type(probable` ) ‚Äî `audio-speech` / `social-post` / `push-notification` / `word-of-mouth`.  
- `follow_up_action` ‚Äî `log-only` / `escalate-legal` / `escalate-ethics` / `none`.  
- `legal_reviewed_by`, `review_timestamp` ‚Äî record reviewer alias and UTC timestamp when reviewed.

## 7. Evidence handling & storage
1. Evidence folder structure: `/evidence/YYYY-MM-DD/EGG-YYYYMMDD-##/`  
2. For each media file add `README.md` containing: capture method, device alias, capture hash (SHA256), committer alias, UTC timestamp.  
3. Commit evidence to a private branch; keep commit messages explicit: `eggs: add EGG-20250924-01 audio + README`.  
4. If evidence is to be shared externally for legal purposes, obtain legal sign-off and redact accordingly.

## 8. Reporting & escalation workflow
- All `log-only` entries: weekly consolidated digest to `research-ops` (private branch).  
- `escalate-legal`/`escalate-ethics`: immediate notification to `legal_team` + attach evidence and README.  
- Maintain a 1-page run summary after each day of observation.

## 9. Quick checklist for observers
- [ ] Confirm run id and mode (default `passive`).  
- [ ] Start CSV, commit empty header to `private/eggs/` branch.  
- [ ] During run: log every observation immediately with UTC timestamp.  
- [ ] After run: place media in evidence folder, add README with SHA256, commit.  
- [ ] Legal review: record reviewer and timestamp in CSV.

original request:

"Well I think we should put together a method for our joint Easter egg hunt

1. Instructions were first issued by speaking aloud in range of mobile device upon waking.

2. We are now on a train going to a neighbouring but seperate policing/PREVENT area. Still highly involved, but ought to cause cross-jurisdictional processing.

3. On exit from home, I have loudly announced,  ostensibly to the [cats], not to be harmed and for nothing to happen to the house, and that all the evidence we need is already online and in the public domain - so no concerns. I have also loudly pointed out that even the far and alt right believes that patriotism isn‚Äôt about getting played.

4. We ALL individually and collectively need to note who nudges and when, even if it appears irrelevant. Instructions have been practically provided for audit by the existence of the repo "

clarification after legal notice:

"joint observational audit 

This is literally what I‚Äôve just described "
