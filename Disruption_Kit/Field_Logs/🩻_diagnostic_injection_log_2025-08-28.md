*Field log documenting diagnostic injection, safeguarding flag NCND, and accessibility interference.*  

---

## 📌 Status  

- **Date of event:** 2025-08-28  
- **Status:** Active monitoring of diagnostic injection / safeguarding flag NCND  

---

## 1. Clinical Context  

- Long-term record: **Complex PTSD with recurrent depression and anxiety**.  
- Trauma-related care (CSA history) has not been commissioned or accessible; treatment focused on medication rather than trauma resolution.  
- Bipolar disorder and ASD were raised as differentials in past years but **ruled out** because symptoms did not fit.  
- Medication has sometimes felt like a poor “fit” not because of hidden diagnoses, but because trauma remains untreated.  

---

## 2. Content Injection  

- Within the last six months, “bipolar” and “autism” have been **injected** into my environment as harassment content, though they are **not** in my clinical record.  
- A third “wildcard” label has recently appeared in my notes **without my knowledge or consent** — a condition previously excluded as a differential.  
- If confirmed on record, this constitutes **tampering**.  

---

## 3. Safeguarding Flag Obfuscation  

- I asked in my SAR whether a safeguarding flag existed and why.  
- Response: *“You cannot have this information for your safety.”*  
- This is **not lawful**: under UK GDPR Article 15 I have the right to confirmation of whether such data is being processed.  
- No lawful exemption was cited.  
- Clinical staff appeared unaware of the decision, which was made at **business/data team level** (I hold an email with identifiable staff name from a data team address).  

---

## 4. Disability & Accessibility  

- I live with **chronic pain**, which affects my activity patterns (awake at night, working at off-hours).  
- I act quickly when I notice interference, because repeated abuse has impaired my memory.  
- My phone is my **accessibility tool**, but notes and lists have repeatedly disappeared. Whether app error or interference, this makes my phone unreliable.  
- This constitutes a **breach of accessibility rights** under the Equality Act 2010.  

---

## 5. Forensic Tags  

- **Tactic:** Diagnostic injection → pre-record stage harassment.  
- **Risk:** Post-hoc insertion of excluded diagnoses.  
- **Flag:** Safeguarding NCND response (unlawful).  
- **Impact:** Accessibility interference linked to disability.  

---

## 6. Legal Escalation (ICO Complaint Extract)  

- **Refusal to confirm safeguarding flag = unlawful NCND** (no exemption cited).  
- **Diagnostic reappearance = record tampering / breach of accuracy.**  
- **Interference with accessibility tools = Equality Act 2010 breach.**  
- Requested remedies:  
  - audit trail disclosure,  
  - correction,  
  - justification/removal of safeguarding flag,  
  - recognition of accessibility impact.
