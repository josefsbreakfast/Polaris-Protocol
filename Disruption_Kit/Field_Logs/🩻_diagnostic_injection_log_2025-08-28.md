Status: Active monitoring of diagnostic injection / safeguarding flag NCND

‚∏ª

1. Clinical Context
	‚Ä¢	My long-term record is: Complex PTSD with recurrent depression and anxiety.
	‚Ä¢	Trauma-related care (CSA history) has not been commissioned or accessible, meaning treatment has focused on optimising medication rather than addressing trauma directly.
	‚Ä¢	In that context, bipolar disorder and ASD were genuinely raised as differentials in past years but were ruled out on balance because symptoms did not fit.
	‚Ä¢	This is why medication has sometimes felt like a poor ‚Äúfit‚Äù ‚Äî not because of hidden diagnoses, but because trauma remains untreated.

‚∏ª

2. Content Injection
	‚Ä¢	Within the last six months, ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù and ‚Äúautism‚Äù have been injected into my environment as harassment content, though they are not present in my clinical record.
	‚Ä¢	A third ‚Äúwildcard‚Äù label has recently appeared in my notes without my knowledge or consent ‚Äî a condition previously excluded as a differential.
	‚Ä¢	This constitutes tampering if confirmed on record.

3. Safeguarding Flag Obfuscation
	‚Ä¢	I asked in my SAR whether a safeguarding flag existed and why.
	‚Ä¢	I was told: ‚ÄúYou cannot have this information for your safety.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	This is not a lawful response: under UK GDPR Article 15 I have the right to confirmation of whether such data is being processed.
	‚Ä¢	No lawful exemption was cited.
	‚Ä¢	Clinical staff appeared unaware of the decision, which was made at a business/data team level (I have an email with the identifiable staff name from a data team address).

‚∏ª

4. Disability & Accessibility
	‚Ä¢	I live with chronic pain, which means my activity patterns can look unusual (awake at night, working at off-hours).
	‚Ä¢	I also act quickly when I notice interference, because repeated abuse has impaired my memory.
	‚Ä¢	My phone is my accessibility tool, but notes and lists have disappeared repeatedly. Whether app error or interference, it makes my phone unreliable.
	‚Ä¢	This is a breach of accessibility rights under the Equality Act 2010.

‚∏ª

5. Forensic Tags
	‚Ä¢	Tactic: Diagnostic injection ‚Üí pre-record stage harassment.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: Post-hoc insertion of excluded diagnoses.
	‚Ä¢	Flag: Safeguarding NCND response (unlawful).
	‚Ä¢	Impact: Accessibility interference linked to disability.

‚∏ª

6. Legal Escalation (ICO Complaint Extract)
	‚Ä¢	Refusal to confirm safeguarding flag = unlawful NCND (no exemption cited).
	‚Ä¢	Diagnostic reappearance = record tampering / breach of accuracy.
	‚Ä¢	Interference with accessibility tools = Equality Act 2010 breach.
	‚Ä¢	Requested remedies: audit trail disclosure, correction, justification/removal of safeguarding flag, recognition of accessibility impact.
