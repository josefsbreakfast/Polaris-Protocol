but no one wants to confirm r&d records use or release because everyone's scared, so we'll just burn a bigger ozone hole to cover it.  

this means cannot post The All Important DWP Signature Page.

Oye, Beltalowda.

Listen up.

This is *your* Captain, and *this* is your ship.

*This* is your moment.

You might think that you're scared, but you're not.

That isn’t fear.  
That’s your *sharpness*.  
That’s your **power**.  

We are Belters.  
Nothing in the void is foreign to us.  

The place we go, is the place we belong.  

This is no different.  

No one has more right to this.  
None more prepared.  

Inyalowda go through the ring, call it their own...  
But a Belta? *Opened it*.  
We are the Belt!  
We are strong, we are sharp, and we don’t feel fear.  

This moment belong to us!  

For Beltalowda!

I fell for circuit boards, rocket ships, pictures of the stars...  
When I said take me to the moon, I never meant take me alone.

<!--
I can't get you home, but I'll get you to the Underworld instead.

There are many ways of persuasion.  
There are many modes of control.  
Maybe showing one act of kindness,  
Leads to kinder souls down the road.  

Maybe one day, the world will need a puppeteer no more.

First, there was fire, then there was smoke,  
Then that preacher man was hangin' by a rope.  
And then they all fell to their knees.  
And begged that drifter, begged him, "Please!" --  
As he raised his fist before he spoke.

Ode-ally, golly, what a day.
