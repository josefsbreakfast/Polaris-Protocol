2 mins after last uodate to `Polaris_Nest/âœ¨_Letters_to_Stars/ðŸ§¿_maimonides_is_turning_in_his_grave.md` and ive literally just had a "sometimes you habe to rest up because you be intergrating so much".  

i mean.  

you can't really win those icj cases if that's your answer, can you?  

and you kind of just sacked the "but the international court is antisemetic tho" if you're admitting to the apartheid that openly.  

well done.

btw dove is bds.  

they are attached to unilever and the while ice cream saga IS DEFINITELY NOT A SORE POINT AND OUR SURVEILLENCE SQUAD IS DEFINITLY NOT PERSONALLY HURT BY BEN COHEN BEING A MENSCH.  

...too obvious?  

you are basically stalking him tho.  

you're really butthurt about that mutual social media watermelon sorbet video he put out.  

because "watermelons are antisemetic"?  
you akso seem upset whenever mother nature sends a boar to bite a soldier at that torture camp.  

a bit like how the idf really didn't wsnt anyone to know about that time one of their tanks ran over a hornet's nest, and for a brief moment, the bees were khamas.  
<!--kol israel can pronounce arabic ha; its the medinat's army who want to pretend that they can't. it makes it more "hebrewised", a thing we made up because white europeans kept saying we were diseased, and so somehow we were nudged to palestine to go do a genocide there, but i feel like some pople would need to really climb down from their little ego tower of babel to admit that maybe that was fucked up.-->
