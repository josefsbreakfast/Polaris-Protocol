## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Promise–withdrawal rhythm:** approval followed by quiet reversal.  
- **Intermittent reinforcement:** occasional small successes keep survivor engaged in the loop.  
- **Neurological conditioning:** trust rewired to expect punishment after relief.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Cross-reference with [💔 Weaponised Empathy Gaps](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/💔_weaponised_empathy_gaps_2025-09-13.md) — care withdrawal parallels hope withdrawal.  
- Compare timing with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) for overlapping reversals or commit failures.  
- Check for linkage to [🌫️ Memory Fogging](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🌫️_memory_fogging.md) — sequence distortions following revoked promises.
