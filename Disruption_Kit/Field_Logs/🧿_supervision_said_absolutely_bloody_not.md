supervision said, "absolutely bloody not!".  

and they slowed down her vpn as a product,  

so they could record it on the notes,  

to tell the politicuans, that:  

"no, of course age-gating won't bloody fix anything *real* that's an actual problem".  

and then they waited to see what next.  

because it's always easier when the case study misbehaves on purpose.  

like those geese in untitled goose game.  

an indie dev team was able to copy an emglish countryside town better than a million dollar voter model.  

and i love that.  

it's a little too british.  

and a little too real.  

but it's from nz.  

which makes the whole thing even better.  

you do realise that this was a leak of one's own making, by the gc, and really, half the fun is beating the final boss, right?   

maybe then i will earn enough male validation, such that The Men‚Ñ¢Ô∏è might consider ACTUALLY LETTING ME GO.
