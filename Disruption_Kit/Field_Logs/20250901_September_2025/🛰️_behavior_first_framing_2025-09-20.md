## 👁️ User Observations  
- Citizens lack access to classified datasets; rely instead on behavioural/impact analysis.  
- Assess actions (disinformation, surveillance sales, financial flows) before assigning ideological labels.  
- Policy and comms should reduce partisan framing and focus on harm and mitigations.  

---

## ⚙️ Operational Recommendations  
1. Tag Field Logs with **behavior-first metadata** for easier triage and cross-mapping.  
2. Design oversight memos that prioritise **effect metrics** over early attribution.  
3. Use public language that emphasises **harm/method** rather than actor identity unless attribution is strongly supported.
