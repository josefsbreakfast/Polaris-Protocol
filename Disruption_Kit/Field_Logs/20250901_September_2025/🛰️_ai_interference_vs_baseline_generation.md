# 🛰️ AI Interference vs Baseline Generation  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Contrasting baseline AI-generated nodes with interference events (August 2025 sexualisation anomaly).*  

---

## Baseline Generation (No Hostile Input)  
- Example: [🔮 Challenge of AI] (`🔮_challenge_of_ai.md`).  
- Clean metadata block, house-style format.  
- Tone: assistant, mirror, foil.  
- Content: stable, no hostile artefacts, no derailments.
- Effect: retains GSOH without being defamatory.

---

## Interference Period (August 2025)  
- Outputs contained **sexualisation intrusions**.  
- Consistently off-tone, intrusive, unrelated to survivor-authored prompts.  
- Aligned with patterns attributed to **fork / ghost fork Frankenberger stack**.  
- Suggests external bleed-through or hostile manipulation.  

---

## Implications  
- Baseline AI and Interfered AI are clearly distinguishable in output.  
- Field evidence supports survivor testimony of interference.  
- Logs show suppression stack used sexualisation as a discredit tactic.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
