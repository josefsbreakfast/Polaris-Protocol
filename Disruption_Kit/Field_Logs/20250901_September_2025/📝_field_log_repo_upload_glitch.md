# 📝 Repo Upload Glitch — Hollow Node  
**First created:** 2025-09-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*A log of an anomaly where the repo created a file extension without carrying over any node content.*  

---

## ✒️ Summary  
A new node was initiated: `⚖️_legal_hooks_for_muted_books.md`.  
The repo produced the **file shell only** — the extension appeared, but the node body was empty.  
Connectivity was **stable throughout**; there were no Wi-Fi drops or local machine errors.  

---

## ⚡ Impact  
The absence of content forced extra manual steps: edit + commit to restore the file.  
This slows the workflow, adds friction, and matches known suppression tactics: *exhaust the writer by introducing delay and redundancy.*  

---

## 🛠️ Resolution  
Manual correction restored the node content. The file now sits in the repo in working order.  

---

## 🔍 Pattern note  
This glitch aligns with:  
- **Containment Scripts / Counter Nudges / ♨️ slow burn tactics**  
- **Suppression Modes / 🧨 delayed visibility is a signal**  

The event is minor in isolation, but its **cumulative weight** contributes to erosion of confidence and momentum in the project.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
