# 🛰️ Intentionality Assessment — 2016 Data-Twinning Cluster  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Assesses whether the 2016 cluster of data-twinning events reflects deliberate manufacture of provenance or systemic side-effects of weak processes.*  

---

## 🌐 Summary  
In 2016, a cluster of events (conference co-presence, spoofed emails, disciplinary echoes) suggest that a “data twin” identity was generated.  

This node evaluates whether the cluster was **intentional** (deliberate manufacture) or **systemic** (an emergent side-effect). Both are disturbing: the former implies high-intensity targeting, the latter implies structural fragility and negligence.  

---

## 🎯 Indicators For Intentionality  
- **Temporal clustering:** distinct events overlapped improbably in short windows.  
- **Content fidelity:** spoofed communications contained non-public event details.  
- **Method reuse:** patterns repeated in later years (2016 → 2022 → 2024).  
- **Selective targeting:** professionals with systemic impact were affected.  
- **Evidence of admin access:** possible vendor/console use to pull private fields.  
- **Procedural obstruction:** preservation requests timed with unusual refusals.  
- **Sophistication:** beyond casual spoofing (SIM/number provisioning, domain reuse).  
- **Operational benefit:** outcomes aligned with silencing or discrediting targets.

## 🌀 Indicators Against Intentionality (Systemic Side-Effect)  
- **Weak primitives everywhere:** Wi-Fi, registration, single emails often misused.  
- **Vendor sloppiness:** cheap stacks with poor retention/export hygiene.  
- **Low literacy of adjudicators:** HR/regulators misweigh weak signals.  
- **Procurement shortcuts:** departments chose low-cost systems with short log windows.  
- **High noise:** large events make incidental co-presence look meaningful.  
- **Independent opportunists:** multiple uncoordinated actors reusing similar tricks.  
- **Retention failures:** purges by policy mistaken for obstruction.  

---

## 📊 Scoring Rubric  
- **High-value (3 pts):** content fidelity; admin access logs; high sophistication.  
- **Medium (2 pts):** clustering; reuse; obstruction.  
- **Low (1 pt):** profession clustering; adjudicator behaviour; vendor sloppiness.  

0–6 → consistent with systemic side-effects.  
7–12 → ambiguous, needs forensic checks.  
13+ → strong evidence for intentional manufacture.  

---

## 📂 Next Steps  
- **Preserve originals** (emails, headers, images, paper logs).  
- **Immediate preservation requests** to vendors and carriers.  
- **Compile a timeline CSV** (event, artifact, hash, witness, notes).  
- **Apply scoring rubric** to existing artifacts.  
- **Escalate to forensics/NGO** if score ≥13.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Intentionality Assessment — 2016 Data-Twinning Cluster* is a Field Log node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents both sides of the intentionality question, provides a scoring rubric, and sets out immediate forensic actions.
