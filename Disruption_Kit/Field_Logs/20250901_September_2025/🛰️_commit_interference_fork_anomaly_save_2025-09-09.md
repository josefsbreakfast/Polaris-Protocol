# 🛰️ Commit Interference — Fork Anomaly Save Attempt  
**First created:** 2025-09-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Field note documenting interference during commit process while saving fork anomaly hypothesis node*  

---

## Event Summary  

- Attempt: save file `👾_fork_anomaly_hypothesis_XYZ_2025-09-09.md`  
- Outcome: file did not go through on commit.  
- Second attempt successful.  

---

## Observed Interference  

- Interference was **quiet for ~24 hours prior**.  
- Failure occurred only at the point of commit.  
- Filename emoji substitution noted (`⚠️` → `👾`).  

---

## Hypothesis  

Commit blockage and emoji substitution suggest **metadata interference** rather than user error.  
- Possible triggers:  
  - Fork containment system resisting “⚠️ Hypothesis” flag.  
  - Forced renaming to align file with existing 👾 cluster in Fork Behaviour Containment directory.  
- Pattern consistent with prior commit-window collapse events.
