# 🛰️ Codename Table Loss — Field Log  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Dated field log recording the deletion/loss of a user-created codename/patronymic table during an interference episode.*  

---

## 📅 Event Summary (Factual)  
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20  
- **Item lost:** Personal codename/patronymic table (digital file with example codenames, patronymic rules, and “I am” phrasing in Russian).  
- **Context:** File created as a small family/operational table; subsequently deleted or disappeared during a documented interference episode (linked to the “loft incident”).  
- **Observed effects:** File missing from expected storage locations; related notes/derivative content also absent on review.  
- **Immediate actions:** Reconstructed copy produced (see Survivor_Tools/🪪_codename_patronymics.md). Checksum + backups created after reconstruction.  

---

## 📂 Sources / Corroboration  
- **Internal:** user’s account of creation and deletion; local directory + cloud sync logs (user-reported).  
- **External:** linked interference incidents logged elsewhere in Field Logs.  

---

## 🧭 Operational Note (Investigatory Lead)  
- Deletion coincided with wider interference episode.  
- Preserve system logs, sync logs, and relevant timestamps for forensic follow-up.  
- Consider evidence preservation steps if escalation pursued.  

---

## 👁️ Observational Aside (Non-Evidentiary)  
- Deletion felt anomalous given innocuous content.  
- Removal perceived as disproportionate to sync/accidental deletion behaviour.
