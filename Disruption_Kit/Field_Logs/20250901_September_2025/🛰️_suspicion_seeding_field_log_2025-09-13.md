# 🛰️ Suspicion Seeding Field Log — 2025-09-13  
**First created:** 2025-09-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Field evidence of low-level doubts planted to corrode trust in allies and witnesses.*

## 🧾 Summary  

This log captures **instances where subtle cues, rumours, or algorithmic patterns sow distrust** between survivors, allies, or witnesses.  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [🪤 Suspicion Seeding] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🪤_suspicion_seeding_2025-09-13.md`.  

Suspicion seeding thrives on ambiguity — these logs transform ambiguity back into data.

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Whisper network mimicry:** false “inside info” creates fear of betrayal.  
- **Platform asymmetry:** different users served different content to destabilise trust.  
- **Timing alignment:** doubt messages spike before disclosures or actions.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Cross-reference [🧿 Persistent Discrediting Force] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🧿_persistent_discrediting_force.md` — sustained DARVO and credibility collapse.  
- Compare with [🪞 Transparent Interference] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🪞_transparent_interference.md` — overt anomalies.  
- Check overlaps with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs] `../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md` — timing of smear coinciding with technical disruption.
