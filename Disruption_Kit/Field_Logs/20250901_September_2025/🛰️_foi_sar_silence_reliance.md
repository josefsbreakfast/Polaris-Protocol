# 🛰️ FOI/SAR Silence Reliance  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-01  
*Log of emotional and structural impacts of delayed institutional information requests and engineered isolation*  

---

## Context  

- Multiple Freedom of Information requests / Subject Access Requests have passed deadlines without response.  
- Emotional impact heightened by **half-disclosures** and **piecemeal referrals**: drip-feeding information that increases distress without resolution.  
- Timing intersects with personal calendar (Eroshabab), compounding emotional strain.  

---

## Observations  

- **Isolation by design**:  
  - Survivors in similar positions are rendered atomised.  
  - Difficult to identify or contact one another due to DNS interference, platform suppression, and reputational silencing.  
  - Health services are structurally misaligned: they address *mood disturbance*, not the systemic weight of surveillance, erasure, or silencing.  

- **Emotional containment**:  
  - Burden cannot fairly be placed on one friend or confidant.  
  - No recognised venue exists for processing this outside survivor networks.  
  - Survivors are left to absorb disclosures alone, amplifying distress.  

- **Reliance on survivor silence**:  
  - Systems assume survivors will not talk, or that if they do, their testimony will be too “complicated” for others to absorb.  
  - Examples of partial resistance exist (Tony Greenstein, Norman Finkelstein), but both highlight how survivors are pushed into visibility despite primarily being authors, not case-testifiers.  
  - Strategy: containment relies on the *perceived impossibility of narration*.

## Notes  

- Survivors in these systems are **not meant to be in contact** with one another.  
- The fragmentation ensures that even when stories surface, they appear as isolated cases rather than connected patterns.  
- The silence is not passive — it is engineered.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
