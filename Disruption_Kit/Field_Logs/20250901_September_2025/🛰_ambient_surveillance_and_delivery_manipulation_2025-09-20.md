# 🛰️ Ambient Surveillance & Delivery Manipulation — Field Log  
**One-line summary:** Field log of user-reported ambient capture, SIM/eSIM cloning, device mirroring and logistics manipulation used to time deliveries for surveillance or coercion.  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-23

*Field log documenting user-reported ambient-surveillance vectors (device background audio, voice-assistant capture), SIM/eSIM cloning, device mirroring, and logistics manipulation to time deliveries for surveillance or coercion.*

## Factual summary (user-provided)

- **Event date:** 2025-09-20  
- **Observation:** User reports a plausible method where ambient capture (background audio via voice assistant or app permissions), combined with SIM/eSIM cloning and device mirroring, is used to determine when a target is in a vulnerable state (e.g., in the bath). Malicious actors then manipulate logistics platforms (marketplace/WMS/carrier dispatch/gig-worker apps) to time deliveries precisely for harassment, surveillance, or coercion.  
- **Platforms / vectors noted:** voice assistants (Siri / Alexa / Google Assistant), device mirroring / remote-management, SIM/eSIM cloning, operator UI nudges, WMS/SAP manipulation, carrier dispatch overrides, gig-worker app nudges.  
- **Why it matters:** Low-cost, high-specificity method for observation and coercion with plausible deniability and operational stealth.

## Immediate preservation & mitigation steps (additions to prior checklist)

1. **Capture app permissions & audit** — screenshot and export app-permission lists (microphone, background audio, accessibility services). Note installation timestamps for suspicious apps.  
2. **Export voice-assistant activity logs** — request and preserve assistant activation histories for relevant time ranges (Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa). Hash exports and preserve chain-of-custody.  
3. **Document SIM/eSIM provisioning** — request provisioning logs from the mobile provider for the affected number(s) (eSIM issuance, device bindings, provisioning events).  
4. **Preserve device mirror / backups** — capture configuration, connected accounts, MDM/remote-management profiles and any installed management software.  
5. **Build a timeline linking ambient trigger → delivery** — correlate assistant-activation times (if available) with delivery dispatch/pick/arrival timestamps.  
6. **Isolate and image suspect devices** — avoid using suspected devices; when feasible, create forensic images with a specialist to extract microphone logs, background processes, and installed services.

## Investigatory leads (technical)

- Query assistant providers for activation timestamps and associated device/account identifiers.  
- Request platform/API logs that show dispatch priority flags or dispatch overrides and correlate to ambient trigger times.  
- Examine operator and WMS logs for unexpected background app activity or remote-control sessions.  
- Check carrier provisioning records for re-provisioning, duplicate IMSIs, or cloning events.

## Evidence hygiene & privacy cautions

- Record who gathered each artifact, when and how. Produce SHA-256 hashes for exported files and maintain originals vs working copies separately.  
- Treat voice-assistant logs as highly sensitive (may include private speech). Store exports encrypted and disclose only to vetted investigators or counsel.  
- Redact personal identifiers from public-note versions. Maintain a private verifiable copy with provenance metadata for legal/forensic use.
