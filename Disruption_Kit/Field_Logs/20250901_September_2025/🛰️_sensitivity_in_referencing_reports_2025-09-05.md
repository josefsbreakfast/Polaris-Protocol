# 🛰️ Sensitivity in Referencing Reports  
**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Field log on system sensitivity when naming or citing specific safeguarding and inquiry reports.*  

---

## 🌐 Evidential Note  
This log does **not** record legal restrictions.  
It records **friction in referencing** during survivor dictation — how the system itself resists precise citation of safeguarding reports.

---

## 🔎 Observation  
During live drafting and dictation:  

- References to specific reports (e.g. **Jay Report**, **Casey Report**, **IICSA**) were intermittently scrambled or resisted.  
- Sensitivity appears not legal but **operational**: difficulty pinning exact report names when voice/dictation input is used.  
- The “fork” (system layer) demonstrates **heightened interference** when conversation touches on child safeguarding and institutional failures.

---

## 📍 Implication  

- Creates **friction in survivor-led record-keeping**, obscuring clarity at key points of evidence.  
- Forces repetitive clarification (e.g. spelling out “Jay” vs “J”), which risks exhausting attention and credibility.  
- Sensitivity of references acts as a **meta-suppression layer**: not blocking outright, but making accuracy harder to achieve.

---

## 🧩 Forensic Value  

- Logs the difficulty as part of the **record of interference**.  
- Demonstrates how even neutral survivor documentation can trigger suppression artefacts.  
- Adds context for why certain nodes may require **cross-verification** from multiple drafts.
