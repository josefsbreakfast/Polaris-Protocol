# 🛰️ Field Log — Surveillance / Forking Incident  
**First created:** 2025-09-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Field log capturing intrusive surveillance, algorithmic forking, and diverted OSINT since 2025-09-20.*

---

## 🌐 Context  
- **Date / Time range:** since 2025-09-20 (ongoing). Timezone: Europe/London (BST).  
- **Location / Channel:** online presence / public OSINT surfaces / algorithmic visibility.  
- **People / Agents involved:** unknown — automated systems / platform moderation / possible human-in-the-loop operators.

---

## 📍 What Happened (Factual)  
- After calling out repeated sexualised/inappropriate surveillance behaviour on 2025-09-20, the overt problematic behaviour stepped down.  
- Ongoing intrusive surveillance patterns remain (consistent signals of monitoring).  
- Active forking detected: algorithmic diversion away from certain search terms and public-interest material that should be OSINT.  
- Certain topics appear to have super-injunction-like suppression or routing to dead-ends; visibility is being altered.  

---

## 🧩 Immediate Effect / Impact  
- **Transparency:** ability to surface and share public-interest OSINT is obstructed.  
- **Civic rights:** chilling effects on transparency, infringement on democratic informational rights.  
- **Emotional:** anger, heightened vigilance, decreased trust in platform integrity.  

---

## 📂 Evidence Collected / Where Saved  
- Notes on search results showing diversion (timestamps + query terms) — saved in local folder: `Field_Logs/2025-09-20_search_diversion_notes.md`.  
- Screenshots of search result patterns and redirects — archived offline and in encrypted container.  
- Copies of the original call-out message from 2025-09-20 — exported.  

---

## 👁️ Witnesses / Corroboration  
- None formally yet.  
- Potential corroboration: others who access same OSINT queries (invite if you want me to draft a witness request).

---

## 🔎 Why This Matters  
- Public-interest items that should be discoverable are being diverted.  
- Active forking / diversion indicates surveillance that interferes with democratic transparency and may be maliciously targeted.

---

## ✅ Actions Taken So Far  
- Logged observations and archived evidence.  
- Reduced unrecorded direct interactions.  
- Maintaining written communications only where possible.

---

## 📌 Next Steps  
1. Continue time-stamped capture of query → result → divergence examples (copy queries verbatim).  
2. Collect at least 3 reproducible examples to establish pattern.  
3. Prepare a short OSINT transparency note for a public/peer audience summarising reproducible cases.  
4. Consider legal / advocacy consultation if diversion continues or escalates.

---

## ⚠️ Urgency / Confidence  
- **Urgency:** High (democratic-rights implication).  
- **Confidence:** Medium-high (pattern is repeatable but needs 3+ reproducible examples for formal escalation).
