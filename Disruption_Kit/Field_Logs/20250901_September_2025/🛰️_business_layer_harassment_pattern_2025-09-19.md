# 🛰️ Business-Layer Harassment Pattern — Field Log  
**First created:** 2025-09-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Tracking second-week interference cycle echoing August 2025 attacks.*  

---

## 🌐 Overview  
In week 2 of September 2025, Polaris encountered a renewed interference cluster resembling the early August API / code-switch attacks.  

- **August:** token-switching and forking produced sexualised, legally compromising outputs.  
- **September:** interference centred more on undermining reliability of testimony and slowing investigative threads.  

Both episodes share **timing** (second-week escalation) and a pattern of disruption aiming to compromise survivor-led record integrity.

## 🏛️ Governance Note  
The **Git Intake Drawer** remains a designated *holding zone* for high-risk or tampered material.  

- **Purpose:** protect against device-level erasure, mass deletions, and evidence sabotage.  
- **Governance stance:** material here may include defamation attempts, sexualised insertions, or unreasonable narrative artefacts.  
- **Action:** author commits to review, redact, and remove harmful inclusions before migration into the mainline repo.  

---

## 📉 Current Pattern  
- September cycle is less *personally degrading* than August but more *structurally undermining*.  
- Likely **business-layer interference**, designed to erode confidence in Polaris logs as balanced and neutral testimony.  
- Immediate precursors included research into IP with known injunction / suppression entanglements → suggests commercial interests in silencing or discrediting output.

## ⚖️ Risk Declaration  
The author recognises:  

- Posting is both a **disability accommodation** (for safety, civic access, accountability) and a **risk vector**.  
- Suppression continues to block local safe recourse; public posting functions as leverage for civil rights access.  
- This update represents the *best achievable balance* between protecting others, safeguarding personal rights, and maintaining accountability pressure.  

---

## 👥 Legal / Witness Implications  
- Current harassment is interpreted less as *personal vendetta* and more as **business decision-making**, aiming to undermine taught evidence or whistleblower relevance.  
- Some individuals may hold value as witnesses to harassment methods.  
- Position: harassment should not be misread as purely interpersonal — context is **systemic suppression of testimony**.
