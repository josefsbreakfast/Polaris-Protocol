# 🛰️ Persistent Discrediting Force Field Log — 2025-09-15  
**First created:** 2025-09-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Field evidence of sustained discrediting, institutional DARVO, and the replacement of protection with silence.*  

---

## 🧾 Summary  

This log documents **repeated or systemic discrediting actions** — unanswered safety questions, contradictory responses, and administrative DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender).  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [🧿 Persistent Discrediting Force] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🧿_persistent_discrediting_force.md`.  

The pattern is long-range: credibility erosion through fatigue, surveillance, and procedural gaslighting until exhaustion replaces voice.

| Timestamp (ISO8601) | Institution / Actor | Discrediting Event | DARVO / Deflection Type | Survivor Impact | Evidence Type | Notes |
|:--------------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|:------------------------|:----------------|:---------------|:------|
| 2025-09-10T16:45Z | Data Protection Office | Refusal to confirm safety of sealed CSA records | “We cannot comment on ongoing matters.” | Prolonged anxiety; sleep disruption | Email chain | Question unanswered despite legal right to clarity. |
| 2025-09-12T11:30Z | Court Administration | Survivor accused of “misunderstanding process.” | Reverse Victim & Offender | Loss of credibility; complaint downgraded | Transcript extract | Classic DARVO turn. |

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Procedural DARVO:** “we can’t discuss that” becomes default refusal script.  
- **Silence as structure:** absence of reply recast as professionalism.  
- **Endurance engineering:** repeated non-answers generate exhaustion indistinguishable from consent.
