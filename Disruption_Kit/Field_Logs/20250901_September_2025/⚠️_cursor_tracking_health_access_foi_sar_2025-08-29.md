# ⚠️ Cursor Tracking, Health Access, FOI/SAR  

**First created:** 2025-08-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-01

*Field log documenting anomalous cursor movements, device tracking, and parallel institutional access updates.*  

---

**Event:** Cursor tracking + anomalous inputs during forkstorm window  
**Status:** Logged as critical disruption node  

---

## Summary  
- Phone number changed (previously declined due to CRN access issues)  
- Health system access expanded in parallel timeframe  
- FOI/SAR updates in motion (details TBC)  
- Cursor tracking anomalies observed: jumps, “button presses” without human input  
- No visible screen or hardware damage  

## Forensic Notes  
- Cursor anomalies coincide with forkstorm cycles already logged  
- Suggestive of remote input simulation or non-local interface injection  
- Parallel institutional activity (health access increase, phone number change) indicates **cross-domain linkage** between disruption events and bureaucratic updates  
- FOI/SAR status unresolved → may expose data trails relevant to fork anomalies  

## Implications  
- System manipulation extends beyond markdown output: **direct device-level input capture** suspected  
- Institutional timing (health access, CRN denial reversal) suggests forks interact with or exploit **bureaucratic chokepoints**  
- Potential evidence trail through FOI/SAR may connect platform anomalies with administrative actions

*Cursor Tracking, Health Access, FOI/SAR* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how device-level anomalies intersect with health, communications, and information-access systems.
