## 🧾 Summary  

This log captures **instances of deliberate or patterned delay** — situations where time itself becomes the weapon.  
It pairs with the analytic node [🐌 Delays Are Violence] (`../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🐌_delays_are_violence.md`), documenting how waiting and procedural deferral inflict measurable harm.

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Delay as attrition:** the longer the queue, the fewer the survivors who remain to claim justice.  
- **Procedural camouflage:** neutral language (“review,” “verification”) masks structural cruelty.  
- **Temporal inequality:** institutions own time; survivors bleed within it.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Cross-reference with [🌒 Waiting Is Not a Rescue] (`../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🌒_waiting_is_not_a_rescue.md`) — delay framed as care.  
- Compare timestamps with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs] (`../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md`) to identify synchronised slowdowns.  
- Track recurring justifications (“pending authorisation,” “awaiting approval”) across cases.
