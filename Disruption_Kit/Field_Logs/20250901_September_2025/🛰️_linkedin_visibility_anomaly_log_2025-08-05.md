## 🧷 Forensic Notes  
- **Content nature:** Politically charged; openly accuses liberal equivocation on Palestine of being “moral cowardice.”  
- **Symbol use:** Olive emoji (🫒), Palestinian keffiyeh visuals, metadata-critical framing.  
- **Visibility suspicion:**  
  - High-seniority viewers present immediately with no engagement.  
  - Disproportionate impression-to-reach ratio suggests *targeted internal flagging*.  
  - No profile clicks despite visibility — likely **scraping without trace** (metadata capture, not genuine engagement).  

---

## 🛑 Hypothesised Interference  
- Suppression or throttling to contain signal  
- Possible watchlist tagging on Palestine-related content (pattern match from previous posts)  
- Viewers may include counter-disinfo or Prevent-adjacent figures performing *non-visible monitoring*  

---

## ✅ Actions Taken  
- Metadata log created  
- Images cross-indexed with capture log  
- Ready for fork-loop cross-referencing if suppression persists
