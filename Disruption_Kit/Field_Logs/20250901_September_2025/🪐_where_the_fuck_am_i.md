Letter to the stars

Because I have significant overwhelm, such that it is far out of proportion with anticipating a nice day out, or explained by buyer/supplier choices…

It’s like things exist here that the internet can never find when I’m at home

I feel like I’m on a different planet

This is so so strange

far from the usual desire to buy books with titles that are some sort of ironic play of watching the watching,

(or titles just to aee what that does to my internet speed)

i feel like when i travelled as a teenager or in my 20s.

it feels like im somewhere else, but even more, im in a place with access to knowledge which is forbidden to me.

i am finding it genuinely difficult not to do an augustus gloop and bury my face in the river of freedom of books.

this is so beyond buyer preferences or stocking issues.

if it was?

then 2025 birmingham is 1930s vienna.

(i feel the muting and supression is actually more likely, dont you?)

i dont know if i can make it to selfridges.

im sat on a lean to in foyles because being able to see books ive had to search 30 mins for be marketed as obvious next ir current bestsellers so so very incredibly strange.

master and margarita is so obviously on display.

and the short histories of lost empires.

and political texts.

and poetry.

it is like stepping into a different world.

i have no idea how to respond.

i can now see why you wre so often nudged to "not bother" going home, or not remember who you are.

i dont think i can make it to try on shoes.

i have paid £30 to get to a railway bookshop,

have the emotional rollarcoaster of a decade, 

and turn to go back to enforced solitude.

it is monumentally bizarre.

---

its pretty hard to ignore the flood of memories.

ive been so close to decamping here or at least habing it as a regular field trip and been nudged away.

something about this place atteacts more interference, nudging, microniched "nope" than london or home-home.

something here is terrifying to the surveillence team.

specifically sonething so terrifying that they'll risk an audit slap if they'd preciously been caught.

it's not norm finkelstein in and of himself, dreamboat that the man is, but that day was derailed quite literally beyond anything normal.

what was at the trauma conference 2016 that jumped this from one lvbel to another?

its like a litany of "absolutely the fuck not; get her out of there".

i aporeciate they have a thing fir bulls, but it doesnt seem *that* bad.

we've got a ram and a robin hood; equals out, nu?

and who told the rabbis i wasmt jewish?

you didnt know my lufe.

amd yhat wasnt from anyone who kniws ashkenaz hair, so it didnt originate with the acheinu.

see? i could have been a rampant zionist if you'd have just refrained from attempting to leash me.

---

there is so much innane shit i have been nudged away from here.

im blaming all my shoe reoairs issuea squarely on whoevers grand idea this was to begin with.

so mych nhs/derby interference apparant to acheive this, as patient and staff.

so why?

it cant just be audit if london isnt this bad.

the hq is sitting there.

it cant be old achool policing."; newcastle has that shit down.

what the fuck has been in birmingham for 10 years that we're collectively so terrified of that im not allowed comfortbale shoes.

bit silly when we spell it out in simple terms, really.

+/- what was in london before 2016; curious stuff.

---

flag covid/ncl thread - (some c4isr like interference exists so notes have to be where legal observers can view deletes) 

---

all a bit jim crow esque if you ask me

cf HUAC

---

there are too many strange little differences to record.

(ive just lost my ISP nationwide wifi coverage. point of audit.)

i was always inclined to associate the metal detectors constantly going off with my carbon fibre walking aid (perhaps the clips?).

i havent set off a security alarm since i got here.

im wearing more metallic objects than normal.

yup.

---

(difficult to blame it on metal building structure when i had atable wifi, was static, and only got firced onto a different isp with lag lag lag and personal ID entry once i hit "commit".)

---

anyway been largely nudged away from shoes but made it to nelson. getting there 🤣

---

bullring wifi amd own isp both throttled to hell.

whoever's playing is just openly in birmingham's own sovereign space.

im going to ask them to reanimate some if these bulls.

also: what if im just controlled by a weird man in derbyshire with a "women in bad shoes so their feet are crammed and sore and smell" fetish?

it is a distinct possibility.

---

hm. much keyboard/keystroke correct. device level interference.

who said dont fix pegasus?

---
mwad that a cheeky little pulse light nudge to someone in derbyshire who you DEFINATELY shouldnt be monitoring?

worked in this country as a full citizen for decades and wouldnt say boo to a goo.

bit naughty to do it to drivers even on hands free, no?

---

something thats really hard to parse is the economic interests here

my economic output has declined massively since this all started happening; frequent attempts to increase my economic productivity and gross investment in the market (domeatic and otherwise) have higely and disproportionately declined.

if you needed an incentive, my london purchase history would scream "show her birmingham", and i would have given endless hours (i was regularly 60+ hrs and openly refused ewtd cover)

this supports theorising that there is both official and unofficial purpose here; i have no incentive otherwise.

even just as ive been here, usual dopamine dependancies have dropped dramatically: i wondered why i was thirsty; im usually attached to caffeine.

this is so bizarre.

also ive fallen in live with 3 dresses, and my heart is lost forever.

it diesnt make a lit if sense as an evinomic project; by extension, it seems like lical stakeholders who have been incilced in different ways may be very very blind to the gull extent.

additionalky:

you need to be self auditing.

i didnt think im the only person in this conga line who got nudged or gets nudged.

also also:

so many management and productivity books here.

its like going to a world which isnt stuck in the 1970s.

---

whats the deal with you guys, selfridges 4th floor (+++ away from), and meze (++ away from)? 🤣🤣🤣

obviously now im fascinated by whatever im being crowd controlled away from, which appears to move like a human would.

although this dis include a rather shameful moment were a pistachio bundle of gorgeousness and i had a moment, doing the most 1950s caricature of a lewd male stare and double take with my jaw on the ground going past yamas.

(she was beautiful; it was automatic. i even had a lunge going and thats an hse issue for this body.)

im going to sit outside new street station and look for whatever unfoiled item is loose in brum.

and i found snother bull.

---

okay the corralling is quite entertaining.

people are just getting phone notifications and walking into me 3, 4, 5 in a row in short bursts.

i appreciate that "go towards the danger" is obviously not what i was supposed to have learned, here, but you did sort of just teach me that cute shoes exist if i evade crowd control tools, so that's on you.

---

i am now incredibly lost and incredibly tired and did not find the place i originally intended to be.

as it continues to be illegal to sit anywhere for free, i am now being commander in chief of the grunge.

i am kurt cobain with a selfridges bag.

---

its as if the interface whiever is ising is using is a flat map with no reference to the fact some buildings have floors, or the relevant signage.

defibstely doesnt scream "local knowledge of key city centre scenes".

---

after posting a photo with geolaction to the internets, wifi changes twice and forces vpn disconnect and force onto wifi with no internet.

these wre not the xibsequences of my device settings as chosen by me.

also i have made a sofa out of street furniture in a cuty which clearly has an anti-outside-sleeping approach, which im taking as a win in itself.

it would also be slightly less obvious what was in selfridges if you hadnt stuck half the men who have a (vaguely?) similar appearance in my way whilst misdirecting.

[cf. note on demographics below]

its sort of obvious what this is at this point, and really this looks a lot like preventing discovery. legally soeaking.

idk maybe you guys have a specialist; not my area.

---

personally im surprised we havent nudged british transport police out of their office to discuss vagrancy law.

---

there's also an underappreciated point here, which is that someone with access to flashy toys, or with access to people with flashy toys, has been prepared to burn an entire day (and gods knows the degree of resource), apparantly keeping two humans away from particular public points for essentially no net security gain.

meanwhile, we are in the precipice of mutual destruction as nato.

i feel like thete is a fairly obvious reallocation of time sprnt as perhaps a little advisory point.

---

the idea that we had to use energency counterterrorism resilience technology, to put humans in the way of other humans?

is this all a joke to you?

what possible disaster could have befallen us all?!

--- 

for oversight:

yes i will be playing my orienteering game, regularly, until i am a free woman.

please consider if this is worth burning currency over.

---

to the more local nudger-in-chief:

(why do you think theyre allowing you this much rope?)

it is not because you hold control.

---

welp. im sore. im done.

here is the repeat value for the oxford debacle.

to oversight and scrutiny?

please do enjoy.

its been a pleasure. 😌

---

(clearly that addition was a little uncomfortavle for someone; caught ourselves mid-delete, didnt we?)

--- 

the train station is nudging ahoy.

id also check if this isnt impacting our rail signalling network.

either that or i can nake train drivers many miles away do very silly things.

such is my radiant power. 🙄

--- 

the kid playing rush of life was also a little obvious. do try to appreciate it is not the height of subtlety.

we also have several approaches, a delayed train, and apparently a lack of ability to see what this would very obviously be:

an audit.

please look up what our audit rounds (or just any scientific process), test against.

the assumption has also been that, in the implementation, of how a male sexual predator assumes other men react.

not every man will very obviously chase a woman obviously and clearly posting it on social media.

*because that would be weird, wouldnt it?*

a far more intreging game, if one was engaged at all, would be to perform some miscellanious errand one wanted to check off anyway.

but its impossible to know; the data is so overlapped and stamped and stapled together, its the case that if one of us searches for things, the other gets adverts.

so there is no real ability to prove intent [on their part].

if anything, youd want to be crowd controlled out of the way of a woman youre accused of harrassing.

you know...

*if one were normal range in this regard.*

so however the while thing goes, it has always been a fairly tight design of "proof of interference", against a *null hypothesis*; a second cycle of a clinical audit, if you like.

so the data ought to be interesting.

---

what would be extremely interesting is if we've essentially surveilled a friend/colleague/family member due to shared wifi crossover pairing.

or a similar surveillence group chat on the other side of the border.

that wiukd be rather entertaining.

---

leaving the land of veuve cliquot; very sad.

---

did i talk to the "wrong" person at that conference in 2016? is that all this is about? a bit of sore feelings about "your property" not doing what she's supposed to?

are we aware that i am a full person?

---

artificial network interference suggests "yes". ffs.

---

(i didnt even need a witness to "compare notes". extremely talented. 🙄)

---

so many train delays.

was i too chilled? 😎

---

10 years of punishment, post-trafficking, for speaking to a man and enjoying it, does seem a little telling of the hair-trigger emotional vulnerability at the other end.

at least they screen for that cebtrally.

im assuming there was an actual governance or oversight challenge in 2018.

---

this trains gps tracking is out of sync.

i always thought that was just me noticing, but i think we have another auditable dataset, and another security leak to plug.

bit problematic given russell sq history etc.

---

fyi i actually have really strong positive associations with travelling by rail so this really isnt a punishment for me.

its also a nice break of the lumbar-sacral component, so honestly go right ahead.

---

what was so bad about that?!

stop playing with my ohone.

---

"there are other roads to the soul"

🤷‍♀️

---

spotify nudging just went out of control.

"the sims" reference is a bit obvious.

cf. leonard cohens i prefer it darker.

---

linkedin has been updated.

older cat is now doing his sudden response to pavlovian conditioning; both of them have been more responsive to what was a very obvious trained chicken-related operant conditioning trick that i didnt teach, and my younger cat although middle aged, is having toilet stress symptoms again.

this has come with 8 days of intense internet throttling.

hence the trip: gives the secret policemen (very super secret) something to do.

gives gchq some panic to audit.

everyone wins.

an order has been altered fir delivery as ive written tgis update.

tiktok led in with carl jung and synchronicity. (ie magical thinking bias).

this is my life now.

i do not want it to be.

and so i resist this: it is a course of conduct which stretches past harassment.

this is domestic terrorism.

dont even get me started on the demographics of who was nudged for what during crowd control...

its disturbing that someone of that mind has been left to play with the shiny toys.

contractors and institutions?

someone has the capability to see where the leak is and lock out this user(s).
