# 🛰️ Network Instability & App Behaviour  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Field log of app crashes, lag, and interference across WiFi and 5G, tested with VPN tunnelling*  

---

## 👀 Observations  
- Multiple app inference issues recorded.  
- Noticeable lag during normal operation.  
- Several crashes observed.  
- Switching between **WiFi** and **5G** did not improve stability.  
- Connection improved when using a **VPN**.  

---

## ⚡ Immediate Reactions  
- VPN tunnelling may be bypassing throttling or packet-shaping measures.  
- Instability appears systemic, not device-specific.  
- Pattern resembles deliberate network interference or poor routing.  

---

## 🔎 Hypotheses  
1. **Throttling / shaping**: ISPs or intermediaries degrading service selectively.  
2. **App instability**: service-side inference handling under strain or poorly optimised.  
3. **Intentional disruption**: connection management influenced externally; VPN masks it.

## 📝 Notes to Self  
- Capture timestamps and app logs where possible.  
- Test on a second device/OS for replication.  
- Correlate VPN provider endpoints with stability.
