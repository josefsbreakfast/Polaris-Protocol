# 🛡️ Clearance Impact Node — Effects on People with Security Clearance  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*How manufactured provenance affects personnel under vetting regimes*  

---

## ⚠️ Risks  
- **False association with hostile actors** → spurious signals stitched into profiles.  
- **Complaints trigger vetting reviews** → routine grievances escalate into clearance jeopardy.  
- **Credential risk from proxy activity** → impersonation or spoofing undermines trust in logins/records.  
- **Reputational cascades** → weak-signal evidence amplified across departments.  

---

## 🛡️ Defences  
- **Forensic provenance required** → demand chain-of-custody in vetting.  
- **Pause policy pending verification** → halt clearance reviews until anomalies are tested.  
- **Rapid preservation routes** → preserve device logs, emails, telecoms metadata.  
- **Investigator training** → recognise synthetic provenance and harassment overlays.

*Clearance Impact Node* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how manufactured provenance destabilises security clearance regimes and identifies defensive practices.
