# 🗒️ Field Note — Conversation Drift & Anchors  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Observing scope drift and meta-artifacts during an extended exchange.*  

---

## 🌀 Observed Drift  
- Began with MI5 scoping → weak points mapping.  
- Shifted into waterproofing metaphors (damp coursing, sump pumps, hydrology).  
- Moved to venue co-presence (NEC, Wi-Fi, data twinning).  
- Anchored on specific events (TI 2016, Nottingham 2022, Birmingham 2024).  
- Tangled with spoofed email / harassment complaint.  
- Expanded to professions targeted (healthcare, law, teaching).  
- Converged on anti-SLAPP Section 17 (Oct 2025).  
- Meta: screenshots of ChatGPT buffering logged as anomaly.

## 🔎 Key Insights  
- Co-presence signals weak if isolated.  
- Public oversharing builds provenance; privacy gaps can be exploited.  
- Registered professions structurally targeted.  
- Anti-SLAPP reform marks an inflection point.  
- Anchors vs narratives must be kept separate.  
- AI disfluency can resemble surveillance glitch → meta artifact.

## 📍 Anchors Captured  
1. **TI 2016** — Edgbaston Stadium.  
2. **Nottingham 2022** — Adjacent Wi-Fi + spoofed email.  
3. **Birmingham 2024** — Norman Finkelstein seminar.
