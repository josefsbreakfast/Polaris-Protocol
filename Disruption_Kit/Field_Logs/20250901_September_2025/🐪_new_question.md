after the birmingham debacle im just going down the list

why gave i beern diverted from horses?

why nudged away from leicester?

the whole spectacle opens a whole pandora's box of questions.

suddenly everything is full of holes where information has been hidden or deleted.

i'm left wondering:

how real is my life?

of course it is, but one can see why such an obvious charade starts to open so many questions.

why have so many things i have wsnted to do, been blocked, stopped, nudged away from, and in many cases quite harmful diversions have been conjured to keep one busy.  


it's just so odd.
