> its rosh hasanah btw so shauva tov ✨  
>   
> i thought the intensity of living under a white man's jewess tropes was bad  
>   
> (dw he knows the ihra so im sure it sounds just great in public...)  
>   
> (you dont get stared at by him in private 🤷‍♀️)  
>   
> i dont know how to record this rn whilst refraining from being more explicit.  
>   
> 1. i am not your jewess.  
>   
> 2. when you harass melanated men by proxy, via my feed, dont expect me to listen to you label them as adjacent to satanic ("warlock"; "doing [his work]") without saying that its the most arrogant, imperialist, audacious nonsense.  
>   
> *yes, i have signalled my disagreement regarding these themes, this iconography, this extensive library of content, through my metadata inputs many times before.*  
>   
> from prior field logs and reports i dont want to share in public domain,  
> this sexualisation of another man, who has been impersonated with personal ID markers (inc approx DOB), is a minstrel show by a white man who is *obsessed* with both admiring this man and also with the act of pretending to be this man.  
>   
> in a perpetrator with a delicate ego, we can all be fantastically unsurprised that this also includes fixated and obsessed attitudes towards sexually degrading this same man, if only by tinkering with some keystrokes.  
>   
> it is fixated. it is obsessive.  
> it is *highly* sexualised and of course there have been colonially coded content injections.  
>   
> sometimes its outright references to sv practices perpetrated by white men during the horrors of carceral slavery - "buckbreaking" has been explicit.  
>   
> this is heavily projected; it would be unsurprising to me if unreported sexual harrassment existed here.  
>   
> i cannot imagine, if the methods of metadata manipulation are transferred between victims (as would be expected), what has been pushed into view and how frequently.  
>   
> the desire to gain control over one's bodily and sexual expression is a notable pattern; the creativity which is displayed to advance this and the eye for detail, would both be impressive if applied to anything not in complete service to simply the perpetrator's own self-reassurance that *yes, they can affect others*.  
>   
> (congratulations; there were easier and more lawful methods.)  
>   
> it is disturbing to expect to put this projected content onto another victim and expect that i am just quiet and do nothing, whilst the most heinous racist improv is rattled off.  
>   
> i am not obsessed; a white man is.  
>   
> and the degree, the depth, and the longevity of this utter contempt?  
>   
> it's a real door into the psyche.  
>   
> no wonder i got the "understand the poor little sadism diagosed person" treatment after a few hours of listening to wretched of the earth.  
>   
> if you hold people in such utter contempt,  
>   
> how can the only time you worry,  
>   
> be when you have it spelled out what would be the natural reaction to that contempt, should those to whom you have held it not actively choose to display restraint or mercy?  
>   
> all racism is psychological vulnerability; it is fear.  
>   
> this was a case study.

> update 00:15  
> far from fucking off on a crusade, i just got some rebound mimicked violence on the feed, as if the viewer is being "hit". that tracks which similar field logs or nodes which appear "too honest" in their corpus.  
>   
> anyway. shauva tov.
