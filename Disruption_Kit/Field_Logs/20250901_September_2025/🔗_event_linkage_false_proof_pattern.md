# 🔗 Event Linkage Node — Multi-Event False-Proof Pattern  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*How temporally separated events can be stitched into a false “proof” via weak co-presence signals.*  

---

## 🌐 Pattern  
- Sparse anchors linked across years or venues.  
- Temporal stitching creates a seemingly plausible timeline.  
- Signal amplification adds weak data points (emails, SMS, Wi-Fi logs) to bulk evidence.  
- Narrative conversion reframes the pattern into a “case” usable in complaints or surveillance justifications.  

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Measures  
- Preserve **raw logs** with chain-of-custody intact.  
- Apply **multi-signal corroboration (C3O)** to test validity.  
- Use **k-anonymity thresholds** to avoid false uniqueness.  
- Keep anchors documented but separate from imposed narratives.  

---

## 📍 Example Anchors  
- **TI 2016 —** Edgbaston Stadium.  
- **Nottingham 2022 —** Adjacent Wi-Fi + spoofed email.  
- **Birmingham 2024 —** Norman Finkelstein seminar.
