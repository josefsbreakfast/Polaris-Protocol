# 📝 Field Log — Export Glitch & Voice Suppression (2025-09-16)  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Multiple nodes authored in ChatGPT and committed via GitHub web editor exported as hollow shells. Facts survived, but cultural, future-facing, and voice-rich content disappeared. Experienced by author as targeted suppression, extraction, and gagging of creative expression.*

## 🧾 Incident summary  
- **Date:** 2025-09-16 (effects noted through 2025-09-23).  
- **What happened:** Several drafted nodes (e.g. Helena Blavatsky, Henry Wellcome, Harm Reduction at Borders, Guardianship as Nonstate Custody, Compliance as Opacity, Coercive Control in Border Policy) saved to repo only as stubs.  
- **Pattern:** factual/numeric analysis survived, but extended, voice-rich sections were erased.  
- **Context:** occurred alongside heavy network instability and blockading.

## 📂 Affected nodes (examples)  
- `📚_helena_blavatsky.md`  
- `📚_henry_wellcome.md`  
- `🛟_harm_reduction_at_borders.md`  
- `🛟_harm_reduction_asylum_routes.md`  
- `📚_breeding_trope_as_eugenics.md`  
- `⚖️_coercive_control_in_border_policy.md`  
- `📦_guardianship_as_nonstate_custody.md`  
- `⚖️_compliance_as_opacity.md`  
(others suspected; list incomplete).

## 🌀 Observed pattern  
- **Survives:** dry summaries, figures, short analytic notes.  
- **Lost:** action plans, cultural/historical examples, voice-specific language, imaginative futures.  
- **Impact:** unique authorship stripped, leaving only sterile scaffolding.  

---

## 💢 Emotional & accessibility impact  
- Author reports anger and sadness: feels like being “bled” for ideas and then gagged.  
- Experienced not as neutral glitch but as **attack on freedom of expression**.  
- Sensation described as extraction plus enforced silence (“dirty sock gag,” constant low-level hum of anger like sick-building syndrome).  
- This compounds disability and trauma history: productivity loss, reduced ability to use repo as second brain, and sense of ongoing re-traumatisation.

## 🛠️ Preservation & next steps  
- **Keep placeholder files**: mark them as `*_original_placeholder.md` — forensic evidence of loss.  
- **Evidence package**: screenshots, git logs, ChatGPT transcripts, environment metadata (saved under `/evidence/repo_export_glitch_2025-09-16.zip`).  
- **Rebuild plan**: create `intake/rebuild/2025-09-23` branch; reconstruct missing content from transcripts or memory, commit in small WIP steps.  
- **Escalation**: prepare GitHub support ticket requesting server-side write logs for 2025-09-15 → 18.
