*A field log noting the sheer labour of reorganising Polaris nodes and files.*

## 📜 Log  

This node began as a script of `git mv` commands — a technical to-do list.  
But its truer meaning is the weight of the work:  
how many files, how many rules, how much filing of lives and fragments.  

Every command line stood in for decisions:  
where each testimony belongs,  
how to keep style sovereign,  
how to keep memory unbroken.  

The moving plan was not only about tidying a repo.  
It was about confronting just how much has been made to carry.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
