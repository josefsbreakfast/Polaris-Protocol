# 🛰️ Theory of Harm — Entrapment by “Protection”  
**First created:** 2025-09-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Field log analysing how coercive “protection” practices create long-term duty entanglement and surveillance loops.*  

---

## 🌐 Summary  
An institutional actor presents coercive behaviour as “protection” (duty-of-care). This has two core effects:  

1. **Case perpetuation:** justifies keeping a case open despite weak or absent evidence.  
2. **Duty entanglement:** creates pressure on others (including whistleblowers) to remain involved.  

Through nudging and proximity tactics — geolocation overlaps, administrative touchpoints — the subject and whistleblowers remain in partial contact. This allows the original actor to repeatedly reframe ordinary behaviour as “risk.”  

The net effect: a manufactured, long-term surveillance loop that sustains harm and chills internal challenge.

## 🔎 Why This Matters  
- This is **not protective practice**; it is coercive and instrumental.  
- Duty-of-care is converted into a **tool for punishment and control**.  
- Legitimate challenge is discouraged by embedding plausible “risk narratives” into everyday operations.

## 📌 Suggested Immediate Asks  
1. Independent audit of the original decision.  
2. Access-log review for case file entries.  
3. Temporary restriction on who can add notes to the case.  
4. Protected-status interview of the whistleblower.
