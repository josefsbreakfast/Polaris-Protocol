**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Record of anomalous behaviour following the commit of 🍊_the_president_as_mark.md.*

---

## Log Context  
During the commit of **🍊 The President as Mark**, the system appeared to briefly reroute or mis-handle the commit action. The file eventually registered correctly, but there was a momentary detour in workflow.  

---

## Observations  
- Commit button initially executed without confirmation.  
- Unexpected rerouting noted in interface behaviour.  
- Final state: file present and correctly stored.  

---

## Analysis  
- Possible latency in commit pipeline.  
- Potential cross-referencing issue triggered by emoji in filename.  
- Behaviour consistent with earlier incidents where non-standard titles introduced friction before resolving.  

---

## Resolution  
- Commit confirmed as successful.  
- No further issues observed once the file appeared in repo index.  
- User confirmed as “sorted now.”
