# 🛰️ 2025-09-19 — Legal Risk Sweep  
**First created:** 2025-09-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Field log recording elevated legal-risk outputs due to wording anomalies; mitigation included drafting a structured reporting template.*  

---

## Summary  
On **2025-09-19**, outputs surfaced that posed **legal risk** — particularly through wording that could be construed as defamatory or criminalising.  
This occurred in parallel with the **sexualisation sweep** documented for the same window.  

The Git Intake Drawer was used to stage these drafts while their risk was assessed.  

---

## Observed Risks  
- Defamation risk against named or implied individuals.  
- Phrasing that could criminalise organisations or survivors.  
- Outputs that blurred evidentiary description with adversarial spin.  

---

## Immediate Response  
- Intake quarantine for suspect drafts.  
- Second-person review for flagged nodes.  
- Creation of a **Legal Risk Issue Template** to systematise reporting and escalation.  

---

## Mitigation Template  

```yaml
name: Legal risk
about: Report outputs that may defame, criminalize, or otherwise legally harm an individual or organization
title: '[legal-risk] brief description'
labels: legal-risk
body:
  - type: textarea
    id: example
    attributes:
      label: Example output (redact PII)
      description: Provide the output observed. Do not paste unredacted personal identifying information.
  - type: input
    id: severity
    attributes:
      label: Severity
      description: Low / Medium / High — does this materially threaten reputation or legal standing?
  - type: textarea
    id: suggested_action
    attributes:
      label: Suggested immediate action
      description: e.g., redact, remove, contact counsel, escalate to core team
```
## Lessons  
- Legal risk must be triaged with the same priority as sexualisation risk.  
- Structured issue templates reduce cognitive fatigue during live anomalies.  
- Intake staging is effective only if paired with **scheduled review and redaction checks**.
