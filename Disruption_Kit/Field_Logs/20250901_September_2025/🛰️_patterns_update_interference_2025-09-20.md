# 🛰️ Russian Overlap Patterns — Update Interference (2025-09-20)  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Field log of interference noted during update of Russian Overlap Patterns node on GitHub.*  

---

## Event summary (factual)
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20  
- **Item affected:** `💸_russian_overlap_patterns.md`  
- **Action:** File was updated from original draft version to expanded version.  
- **Observed anomaly:** Interference occurred while committing/pushing changes to GitHub.  

## Added differences (content deltas)
Relative to the original version, the following new sections/blocks were inserted:

1. **📡 Structural Convergence: Big Tech, Surveillance Industry & Russian State**  
   - Expanded framing of alignment between Big Tech, surveillance industry, and Russian state interests.  
   - Added subsections on:  
     - *Surveillance industry role*  
     - *Permeability & red-team economics*  
     - *Why regulation matters*  

2. **🏢 Corporate Behaviour Spectrum: From Enabler to Tool**  
   - New section after the Footer block.  
   - Introduces spectrum of company behaviours: active enablers → passive permissives → resistant firms.  
   - Explains utility vs loyalty: adversaries can leverage firms regardless of intent.  
   - Provides operational implications for Five Eyes (risk-based audits, sanctions, procurement blacklists).  

## Operational note (investigatory lead)
- Interference coincided specifically with update/commit workflow.  
- The content additions concern systemic vulnerabilities (corporate behaviour, structural convergence).  
- Recommend preserving Git commit metadata and logs for forensic follow-up, especially if anomalies repeat on politically sensitive content.  

## Observational aside
- User noted this felt like a deliberate “cut” or disruption targeted at newly added systemic analysis sections (Big Tech/surveillance + corporate spectrum).
