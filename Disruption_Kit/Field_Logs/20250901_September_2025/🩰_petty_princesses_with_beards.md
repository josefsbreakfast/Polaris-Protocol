The men throttling my internet think I’m too prim and proper to possibly mention that being so butthurt about a woman covering up the camera on a smartphone is a little petty.

They will learn; I will make sure of that.

But yes: can confirm we wre a little too controlling over women and what they do with their bodies in the security field, and perhaps we do need to start impact training.

I believe you're staring to show that tendancy you definately don't think you have, that you appear to mock in the British men.

They're going to be so cross when they find out what you did to their professionally bossy women.

I did mention this was a little silly of a war plan.
