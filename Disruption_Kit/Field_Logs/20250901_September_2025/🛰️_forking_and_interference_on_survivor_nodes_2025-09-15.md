# 🛰️ Forking and Interference on Survivor Nodes  
**First created:** 2025-09-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Forensic note: lag, moderation deletions, and live interference operating as containment.*  

---

## Observed Interference  

- **Lag spikes** during testimony drafting → disrupted flow, engineered disjuncture.  
- **Moderation deletion** of survivor comment → non-compliant with ToS context, functioned as erasure.  
- **Forking** of text trails → multiple divergent fragments, record instability.  
- **Containment effect** → increased survivor labour, repeating testimony across forks.

## Analysis  

These interferences replicate existing Polaris signatures:  
- [🪞 Engineered Disjuncture of Allies] (`../Disruption_Kit/Containment_Scripts/Suppression_Modes/🪞_engineered_disjuncture_of_allies.md`) — lag as isolation vector.  
- [📚 Forensic Silence] (`../Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/🌀_System_Governance/📚_forensic_silence.md`) — erasure through selective moderation.  
- [👾 Metadata Breakpoint Log] (`../Metadata_Sabotage_Network/🔎_Evidence_And_Anomalies/👾_Breakpoints_And_Glitches/🚀_metadata_breakpoint_log_2025-08-05.md`) — record splitting/forking as anomaly.  
- [🕸️ Dragnet as Default] (`../Metadata_Sabotage_Network/Governance_And_Containment/㊙_Containment_Contracts/🕸️_dragnet_as_default.md`) — moderation logic as surveillance extension.  

CIDT impact: forcing repetition, undermining continuity, enforcing exhaustion.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
