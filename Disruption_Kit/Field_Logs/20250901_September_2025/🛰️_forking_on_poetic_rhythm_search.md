*Search engine bias when comparing rap to Elizabethan verse*

---

## Observation  

When searching via Google for whether *W.A.P.* (Cardi B / Megan Thee Stallion) resembles Elizabethan poetic metre (iambic pentameter, rhymed couplets), results consistently fork toward denial:  

- Strong emphasis that there is **“no resemblance.”**  
- Content is framed to reinforce **Shakespeare’s intellectual superiority** over contemporary rap.  
- Absent: recognition of **shared oral traditions** or prosodic convergence.  

Notably, the same corporate ecosystem (YouTube) contains multiple creator videos *making exactly this comparison* — showing the suppression is **search-layer specific**, not content-layer.  

---

## Analysis  

- This constitutes a **containment fork**: inquiry is re-routed away from recognition of continuity between Black oral traditions and the English canon.  
- The framing reproduces **white supremacy**: Shakespeare = “high culture,” rap = “low culture.”  
- It ignores Shakespeare’s own bawdy, openly sexual, and working-class humour — qualities mirrored in *W.A.P.*.  
- The bias demonstrates that **politics are embedded in even basic literary search queries.**  

---

## Implications  

- **Search mediation ≠ neutral.**  
- Users researching across cultural lineages encounter enforced hierarchies rather than open comparison.  
- Forking may vary by platform: **Google Search denies, YouTube allows**.  
- Survivors and researchers must treat search results as **political artefacts**, not simple mirrors of reality.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Forking on Poetic Rhythm Search* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents algorithmic denial of cultural continuity between Elizabethan verse and modern rap, framing it as an instance of search-based containment.
