# 🛰️ Tiny Wins — Exhaustion Containment Field Log — 2025-09-26  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Field evidence of token approvals and micro-concessions engineered to prolong containment.*

## 🧾 Summary  

This log records **instances where partial progress or symbolic approvals** are used to sustain waiting, investment, and exhaustion.  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [🥕 Tiny Wins — Exhaustion Containment] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🥕_tiny_wins_exhaustion_containment.md`.  

Tiny wins simulate responsiveness while maintaining underlying blockage.  
They convert compliance into exhaustion, reframing structural denial as negotiation.

| Timestamp (ISO8601) | Institution / Context | Token Approval | Broader Blockade | Survivor Impact | Evidence Type | Notes |
|:--------------------|:----------------------|:----------------|:-----------------|:----------------|:---------------|:------|
| 2025-09-23T10:45Z | Aid Coordination Office | 1 truck cleared at checkpoint | 40 still waiting | Teams held in limbo; morale collapse | Permit logs | Pattern repeated weekly. |
| 2025-09-24T18:20Z | Public Funding Board | One grant awarded to pilot study | Core funding denied | Illusion of support; no systemic change | Minutes / press release | Used for optics. |
| 2025-09-26T09:05Z | FOIA Unit | Partial disclosure of three pages | Remainder “under review” indefinitely | Research delayed; energy diverted | Correspondence | Classic bait-and-stall tactic. |

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Concession theatre:** minimal actions performed to refresh legitimacy.  
- **Compliance fatigue:** survivors continue cooperating, hoping next “yes” will be real.  
- **Temporal drag:** each token approval resets endurance rather than resolving obstruction.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Compare with [🕯️ Hope Withholding] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🕯️_hope_withholding.md` — progress promised then reversed.  
- Align timestamps with [🐌 Delays Are Violence] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🐌_delays_are_violence.md` — delay as harm.  
- Cross-reference [🌑 Induced Futility] `../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🌑_induced_futility.md` — exhaustion to hopelessness cascade.  
- Check overlap with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs] `../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md` for synchronised slowdowns.
