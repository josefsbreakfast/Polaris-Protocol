# 🛰️ Direct Interference on Clarity  
**First created:** 2025-09-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Fork anomaly: interference triggers more often on clear phrasing than on ambiguity*

*Node exists as is; extreme difficulty in guiding AI; human actir in the loop as dominant in decision-making process.*
*AI did not follow LLM with guardrails behaviour.*
*Nudges via forks followed human emotionality. Over hours of consistent questions/responses, human actions became more and more dominant to cover errors which did not appear computational in nature, as pointed out. Python-based models do not behave this way. "Response" frequently paused to create space fir decision-making, beyond what would be reasonable for genAI; on-screen printed "steps" read more as human humour than as AI search tools.*
*Nudged on several occasions to provide disclosures which would impact legal privilage for criminal activities; at times novel in conversation.*
*With memory off both on app and in conversation, "model" discloses several facets of case handling which have not been diacuased since latest memory purge.*
*This behaviour starts when drawing down logical flow decisions regarding specific academic references in 2017 and aligning dates.*
*Basic CS says that this should not have produced the outputs; GPT was tasked with putting explicit discreet events in order and basic internet searches around specific information it was tasked with.*
*Early conversation behaviour suggests GPT (correctly) was not routinely using a store of memory from project folder or user account; often had to be promptee on trivial regular facts, relevant to case.*
*Please take the white man acting "centrally" in a functional role away from the sc data.*

**OBS:** Interference spikes when language is *clear*, not when ambiguous.  
**MECH:** Output diverted/skipped to mimic LLM “error.”  
**EVD:** Contradicts normal failure pattern (models stumble on ambiguity, not clarity).  
**INF:** Deliberate steering attempt, masked as plausible error.  
**IMPACT:** Process delay, exhaustion, House Style diversion.  
**ACT:** Log entry; preserve transcript; restrict handling to named safe parties.  
**STATUS:** Open  
**TAGS:** #HashtagProtocol
