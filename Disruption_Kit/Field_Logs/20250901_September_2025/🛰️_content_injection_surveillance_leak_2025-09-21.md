# 🛰️ Content Injection & Surveillance Leak — Field Log  
**First created:** 2025-09-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28  
*Dated log documenting alleged content injection, tarot-reading leaks of co-accused views, FOIA refusals, and ongoing surveillance concerns.*

## 📅 Event Summary (Factual)  
- **Event date:** 2025-09-21  
- **Observed anomaly:** Suggested views/opinions of co-accused appear leaked into “tarot readings” shown to user.  
- **Context:** Occurred following a non-PACE arrest; subsequent charges split by counties.  
- **FOIA response:** User’s own FOIA returns declined with “cannot disclose for crime detection” – unclear basis; reads as if surveillance from arrest still ongoing despite lack of lawful grounds.  
- **Privacy breach concern:** Particulars of “reading” suggest surveillance of co-accused is ongoing; breaches FOIA because co-accused have not given permission for their personal data to be disclosed, especially not via algorithmic skewing/content injection.  
- **Technical suspicion:** Possible device/eSIM mirroring during metadata audit; done under guise of impersonation of potential whistleblower.  
- **Risk to witnesses:** Both victims here reported as vulnerable/at-risk witnesses to Cabinet Office; witness protection requested for them and families.  
- **Key question:** Why the person/system with surveillance capabilities is still behaving like this.

## 👁️ Observational Aside  
- Shows how algorithmic content injection (e.g. “tarot readings”) can function as an informal data leak, breaching privacy and FOIA duties.  
- Highlights the vulnerability of co-accused and witnesses when surveillance data is repurposed or displayed without consent.  
- Illustrates how fragmented charges and opaque FOIA refusals erode trust in due process.
