## 🧭 Observed Effects

- Created doubt that “central services” could be receiving a full or accurate picture.  
- Intensified perception of enforced silence: *“This is prison, just by another name.”*

## 👁️ Observational Aside  
- The incident highlights how minor technical disruptions become meaningful in contexts of surveillance/containment.  
- A DNS failure in isolation is banal; here it reinforced a systemic pattern of exclusion and suppression.
