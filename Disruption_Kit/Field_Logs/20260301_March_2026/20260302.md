[What I am, is fucking furious.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaVT2gH/)  

[So far Britain, France, and Germany are all party.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaVGyL2/)

First off, neither the United States or Israel I have actually consulted with any of their wider parliament.  

Secondly, there are already clear war crimes which have been commit committed; whilst I appreciate that international humanitarian and law needs far better enforcement, the standards should be that we never fucking murder civilians. If we have the precision technology that we all brag about, they should not be that fucking hard.  

Thirdly, the UK has not consulted with parliament because it is not yet fucking Monday - Israel, who by the way have an organisation in government that controls the siege to Gaza which doesn't work on Shabbat even during emergencies, still managed to make the first strike on the Sabbath. *Explain it to me like I'm 5.* A lot of you don't realise, because you all think that that country represents all Jews, there are a lot of laws that Jews have regarding if we ever have to engage in violence even as protection, and Israel just ain't following any it. Issues like this and why I do not like referring to the state with the name of one of our prophets, nor do I particularly enjoy having to use the name which we use for our religious group within prayer.  

Furthermore, there are no reports that a drone has truck RAF Akitori. Whose drone this is, or how much of a meaning will threaten it was, or whether it was downed which would really be the preference for defence, do not appear yet confirmed. However, just because someone strikes you once doesn't mean you ultimately have to allow your friends who are batshit insane to be on your base.  

Moreover, alongside the civilian deaths in Iran of people in Iran including children, there are also already US servicemen who have died in the line of duty. That's on day one. Their families are now going to have to refer to "Operation Epic Fury"; this will tank recruitment, not simply because you cannot keep your personnel safe, but also because it is incredibly insulting to name something like a Pokémon fucking trading card, when people are sacrificing their lives. The majority of people who go into the armed forces are putting their lives on the line for what they believe is going to be legitimate defence. Not whatever the fuck this is. This is already dividing people so strongly, and there are already why references to Vietnam and Iraq. Israelis who are still within the state of Israel have been reporting for a long time that the state is disintegration and that civil and rest is so significant, and that this particularly presents a threat to the Prime Minister of Israel. I often find that People equivocate the end of the state of Israel or a significant change the state of Israel's governance, as somehow being alike to the end of the Jewish people - none of that is true. whilst I recognise that there is a significant risk of violence that comes as a backlash, there hasn't been a single other country that when it went through a process of significant and profound political change, every single person just disappeared. Western government use this rhetoric and it is paternalistic towards Jewish people, as it essentially trapped them into a situation where any challenge of their government has seen as illegitimate, even when their prime minister has not answered his corruption charges fully, even as they have serious concerns and belief that they were pulled into essentially a large guilt trip in order to go to Gaza, and even when they have serious concerns about the Knesset. It's pretty ironic for white men who discuss "the only democracy in the Middle East", to simultaneously be undermining Israel's whenever they actually engage in profound democratic resistance.  

In regards to everyone, so to the school girls and their teachers who were murdered, in regard to the US personnel who have died whilst in service to US forces, may all of their memories be a blessing and may peace be upon them.  

Whoever is advising this from a British perspective, needs asking what exactly we perceive ourselves as either owing the United States in Israel or the risk that we perceive if we were to not engage in whatever this is, because there is a high risk that our own personnel will be asked to engage in actions which support war crimes, and we need to have a really transparent conversation about exactly why we are being positioned as needing to engage with these forces. You can be allies with a country, and not follow them into every precarious situation; you can have friends who do crazy shit when they are drunk, does not mean you have to follow them every time they do it. The fact that we are talking about this as if it's unavoidable is extremely concerning. None of this has been raised to our parliament because it has been the weekend, and the further down the rabbit hole we go, the harder it is to withdraw, so already this feels like a situation we are being coerced into supporting as a country.  

Furthermore, it is notable that whilst during the initial protests which Iranian people engaged in at significant risk and cost to themselves, our own media platformed British Iranian voices and voices of Iranian people living in the UK; it's notable that that is not the case right now.  

Our country consistently uses people in this way, where you are used for permission to talk about an issue, and then you are tokenised when it comes to the meaningful decision-making.  

It is really unclear why we are currently engaging. There is a high risk of further war crimes being perpetuated. This is deeply unfair to those UK personnel, who joined for the Marietta reasons that they did, but expected to follow some standard rules of human decency for engagement. This is why we have international law, and it is utterly bizarre to watch what's going on.  

You can say that the leadership and the regime of Iran are absolutely terrible, and you can still say that a bombing campaign is not the only way of doing things, and is the highest risk method to assisting people in Iran currently.  

Following the pre-emptive strikes started by Israel and the United States, there have now been strikes across the Middle East from Iran. This was foreseeable.  

To say that the United States and Israel are run by men who are sensible and restrained and all worthy of our support, is a fairly fucking bold statement; both men face criminal charges in their own home countries. If we have dependencies that are tying us into this, or if we have concern for how they may impact our systems or our defence, we need to start talking about that.  

[This is quite a distressing clip, and includes other human beings loudly expressing pain in the aftermath of strikes, so please be careful if this is not the right time for you. I'm including this because this is what war looks like.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaVooJu/) There are also images of human beings in shrouds post-mortem, and whilst you can't see their injuries or their faces, I am aware that this can be very distressing.  

In regard to what this man is saying, those were all very foreseeable things that were escalated by the military forces from his country, and it should be noted that the Israeli public has been requiring further narrative reassurance from government to even continue the operation in Gaza.  

This is not a stable government, and they are not necessarily going forward with the will of their own people.
