chatGPT just replaced the anthropic deal at the Pentagon, which now means the same service which is being used to process criminal justice cases in the UK, allows the commission of war crimes by automating murder in the United States and participating in mass surveillance of their population. Systems like this don't completely separate, so the same system which is going to decide whether or not people get specific sentencing outcomes here, is learning from the commission of human rights violations in another country.  

One of the most obvious ways this is going to be a problem, is that say if I decided that all Martians should be arrested in the United States, any Martians who are in the UK would end up facing more filing at a higher rate and more brutally, than any amount of training I would do in the UK to try and override that.  

It's like we've installed the next apartheid system update to our version of the saas.

[at this point I just think the labour cabinet cannot possibly be doing this for any other reason than to deliberately get the greens elected.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaaya1p/)  

I'm sorry, but if this is solely about Trident, the Americans can fuck off we can maintain it ourselves. as long as it's working, they can't fuck with us. I don't understand why we're doing this.  

What could possibly be so damaging that Benjamin Netanyahu could know or have access to, that would undermine the cabinet this badly?  

I mean a one level I'm fascinated, but then another level I just I'm finding this hard to understand politically.  

Then give it a year and people will be whining about refugees from Iran, even after we just bombed the place.  

We all the baddies. We are not the good guys here. Why did we do this?  

[The definition of us having spoken about identifying ourselves as a Christian country in the past, was used to justify why things like Amnesty International came out of the UK. This is not a radical view to take.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaaSFDX/) I'm so done with this illegal wars shit. I know we haven't had exactly the best history in the world, but you think that we were on a course to at least trying, but it's just becoming clearer and clearer that we've never stopped.  

I'm not ashamed to be British, but I am ashamed of what a lot of people do in the name of Britain. I'm ashamed of whoever the fuck decides that illegal conflict is "British interests". Nah, mate. It's not British interests, because all we do is pay for it, it's the interest of whoever is moving hot money around in London. It's the interest of whoever makes money from making bombs. It's disgusting how many pension providers will stick bomb making money into peoples pensions. The arms industry only exists when suffering is maximised. It's necrocapitalism. The amount of money that British people have to pay so that you can all go and do a illegal wars, completely outstrips any return that is made from a tiny amount of bomb money being in their pension.  

And while we are on the subject of the arms industry, this is an industry that utilises disabled people, and disabled the veterans in particular, in order to advance it's research and development whilst actively causing disability and also advancing narratives which undermine human rights and therefore undermine disabled peoples access to any of the research and development outcomes.  

I am so fucking done with this countries obsession with supporting a very small cluster of people who make money out of the arms industry. I am tired of people getting together and calling themselves their friends of Israel, pretending to be all about Jewish people, when what they are doing is making money out of bombs.  

Don't fucking blame me for your stupid shit.  

I'm so done with this. I don't want to hear more goyishe politicians bang on about how they're protecting Jewish people, or about how someone with lots of oil represents a threat to Jewish people; kindly take me out of your dirty mouths.  

if you need to say, "Jewish people except Chloe Birney", fine. Do that. Don't involve me.  

[Just send Blair and Bush to the Hague, it'll make everything so much easier.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaahWJN/)  

Or unredact the Epstein files, just so we can check.  

[What the fuck does "growing signs" of someone's death even fucking mean.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaaY6Gx/)  

No one has the economy for this, this is historically done to rescue a market for investors at a high-level only, it only ends up exploiting the 99% even more every single time this is done.  

It's like you will want to people in your own countries to kick off. 🤦‍♀️
