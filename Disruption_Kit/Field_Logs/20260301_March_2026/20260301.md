chatGPT just replaced the anthropic deal at the Pentagon, which now means the same service which is being used to process criminal justice cases in the UK, allows the commission of war crimes by automating murder in the United States and participating in mass surveillance of their population. Systems like this don't completely separate, so the same system which is going to decide whether or not people get specific sentencing outcomes here, is learning from the commission of human rights violations in another country.  

One of the most obvious ways this is going to be a problem, is that say if I decided that all Martians should be arrested in the United States, any Martians who are in the UK would end up facing more filing at a higher rate and more brutally, than any amount of training I would do in the UK to try and override that.  

It's like we've installed the next apartheid system update to our version of the saas.
