<!-- No one locally wants to move for fear of that big "national security" flag, but as this is my health data, it would be nice to at least be told it is safe rather than all about the free lunches you are collectively enjoying while the "terrorist" gets to lie uncomfortabley across an odd selection of pillows, because her healthcare data cannot be confirmed, and it doesn't feel reassuring in the slightest. I have no idea what you could all possibly be doing that achieves more than a consultant anaesthetist and a syringe full of corticosteroid and lidocaine can acheive on this body, but let start by saying the "free"ish lunches to the health service feel a good 15 years in the past.

At least I'd struggle to do a terrorism; is this the new PAMP/Channel bargain bin technique?

"Terrorist", indeed. For what, precisely?

Putting everything on the table for the state when I was 15?

Admittedly, probably "extreme" for those of us with softer hands. I take your point.-->

## ✅ Quick Gate (answer in order)  
1. **Immediate harm?** If yes → **EXTRACT NOW**.  
2. **Can provider logs or synthetic probes replace live exposure?** If yes → stop live probe.  
3. **Is telemetry ephemeral/only live?** If yes → consider **short probe (≤72h)**.  
4. **Informed, revocable consent on file?** If no → stop.  
5. **Named approvers (ethics/legal/tech)?** If no → pause.  
6. **Extraction capacity ready (safe space, transport, psych/legal)?** If no and extraction needed → escalate resources now.  
7. **Outcome:** Extract / Short probe (48–72h) / No live probe (use providers/synthetic).

## ⏱️ Timing Defaults  
- Intake & triage: 0–24h.  
- Short probe window: ≤72h, review at 48h.  
- Extended (7–14d): exceptional; requires oversight renewal every 24–48h.  
- >14d: formal programme only (generally avoid).

---

## 🚫 Hard‑Stop Triggers  
Physical threats; doxxing; acute mental‑health risk; credential theft; attacker escalation after contact; legal exposure; consent withdrawn.
