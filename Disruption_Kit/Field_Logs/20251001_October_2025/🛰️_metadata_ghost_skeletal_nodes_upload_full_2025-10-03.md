# 🛰️ Metadata Ghost: Skeletal Nodes on Upload  
**Date observed:** 2025-10-03  
**Location:** `Polaris-Protocol/Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/🍯_Body_Politic`  

---

## 📝 Observation  

Multiple nodes uploaded as part of the **🍯 Body Politic** cluster showed as **skeletal drafts** on GitHub (title + emoji header only, ~2 lines of content) instead of the full markdown text contained in the source bundle.  

### Impacted files  
- `🫀_disabled_refusal_as_politics.md`  
- `♿_containment_by_pity.md`  
- `🏥_spec_sheet_for_dignity_re-institutionalisation_creep.md`  
- `👁️‍🗨️_surveillance_of_disabled_bodies.md`  
- `🦿_eugenics_as_everyday_metaphor.md`  

Expected: full node content (definition, patterns, counterforce, constellations, stardust, footer).  
Observed: skeletal drafts truncated to headers only.  

---

## 🔎 Anomaly  

- Source files locally contained full text at time of bundling.  
- After commit, several files displayed truncated.  
- Not user-initiated stripping — implies **upload or repository interference** (client, GitHub API, or external).  

---

## 📖 Contextual Significance  

The nodes impacted are not random. They form a coherent cluster:

- Disability dignity and refusal  
- Surveillance of disabled bodies  
- Re-institutionalisation creep  
- Eugenics as everyday metaphor  
- Containment by pity  

This seam underpins a **highly rhetorically powerful critique** of industries adjacent to AI, Big Tech, arms, and veterans affairs.  
If one were surveilling me, one would know that this is the thread I was about to pull.  

This pattern also puts my work behind.  
Now that I know several nodes are affected, I have to check them individually — not just for truncation but for subtle tampering:

- Does the tone still match my own?  
- Has any sexualised or libellous content been injected?  
- Have characters been swapped for look-alikes to break links or insert slurs?  

I have documented before that whatever cybersecurity issue I’m facing sometimes injects small changes: a couple of words, a few lines, even a whole node.  
These micro-changes alter meaning, risk, and credibility.  

The result: I’m thrown off from the more interesting and powerful content I’m trying to produce.  
The auditing work becomes a brake on my analysis, just at the moment when it is most rhetorically powerful.

It is also concerning because I am dealing with a surveillance apparatus that is not only segregationist but also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and profoundly ableist.  
We are already in a human rights crisis for disabled people in this country — recognised by the UN — and have not improved on that for decades.  
That this interference sits so close to my work on disability and dignity is deeply concerning to me.  

Because of the issues I face as a disabled woman and a survivor of surveillance abuse, it is significantly harder for me to get out of this containment.  
This context matters: it explains why the truncation of these specific nodes feels like more than a glitch.

## 🛠 Next Actions  

- Compare local zip contents to repository history (`git diff` after push).  
- Re-commit one affected file manually from desktop to test.  
- If persists, test renaming without emoji to isolate encoding bug.  
- Document pattern for future suppression logs.  

### 🐝 Reader Reflection  

If you are reading this and you are not disabled, pause here.  
If I have to go through this amount of difficulty simply to speak about disability, consider what that says about the systems around us.  

These are not exotic demands; they are basic civil rights.  
Most ordinary citizens believe such rights are already secured for disabled people. They are not.  
I do not experience citizenship in the same way that an able-bodied person does — particularly since the pandemic.  

I can forgive much of what has happened and see it as work to be rectified in good faith.  
But it becomes harder when I see the number of laws breached that were written after 1945.  

I need people to understand this.  
And I say this as a Jewish woman: Jews were not the first people targeted.  
There was another group targeted first.  
Start researching who it was, and you will begin to see the order in which people are still targeted today.  

**I need able bodied people to get to grips with what Aktion T4 was**, how outraged the German public initially was, and how the suppression of dissent led directly to the remainder of the Holocaust. I need you to start looking round and seeing the parallels today.  

_**We were the first "useless eaters"; compare with the language of "scroungers" and "sponges" and "cheats".**_  

*Society has not changed enough to forgo vigilance.*  

How many more of us need to die in poverty, with HM Coroner openly pointing to the instruments used to contain us, before it stops?  

You want a better NHS?  

You want better services?  

Protect disabled people.  

We will fix what no-one else will.

*Metadata Ghost: Skeletal Nodes on Upload* is a field log of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records anomalous truncation of disability politics nodes during upload, to preserve evidence and pattern recognition.
