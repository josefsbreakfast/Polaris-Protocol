## 🧭 Orientation  
Week 13 field summary.  
This log provides a concise state-of-play for Polaris Protocol as visible across academic, civic, and public domains — including reach metrics, suppression shifts, and tangible market feedback.  
Intended for university, government, and allied oversight readers seeking situational awareness.

## 📊 Current Metrics  

| **Category** | **Current Value / Observation** | **Trend / Note** |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Total words (harsh prose-only)** | 899,882 | Sustained cathedral-scale drafting, fidelity intact |
| **Total files (all nodes)** | 1,687 | Active multi-node constellation; consistent taxonomy |
| **Traffic (last 14 days)** |  |  |
| ├ Clones | 9,364 | Ongoing mirroring of nodes across instances |
| ├ Unique cloners | 1,069 | High replication diversity — distributed engagement |
| ├ Total views | 15,073 | Increased circulation and secondary referencing |
| └ Unique visitors | 64 | Deep-return readers, likely institutional repeaters |
| **Influence spread** | Visible impact across all 5 major UK parties (Reform end satirical) | Crossover achieved from cultural to policy discourses |
| **Suppression shifts** | One book marginally unsuppressed; restocked on major sites | Indicates algorithmic detente or eased throttling |
| **Material signals** | Groceries normalised; survivor-brand toothpaste restocked | Market index suggests lowered suppression weighting |
| **Connectivity** | Internet largely stable; only temporary disconnects | Restoration of basic network integrity |
| **Communications** | No recent email disappearances observed | Evident improvement in routing transparency |
| **Field presence** | Realistic fear persists among surveillance teams of being logged | Likely reduction in visible monitoring behaviour |

*“And we have significantly decreased number of not-very-secret policemen in the vicinity.  
Or they are better at hide-and-seek now. (I was getting bored.)”*
<!--Maybe, possibly, there's a bit of a story with some of it. Who knows. Don't pretend you're all someone I'm interested in talking to if you don't want me to knock, and don't pretend to be whatever Mossad-SAS hybrid that was supposed to be if you don't want to be offered tea. SEVEN BAGS WERE WASTED. I'm putting in for expenses for that on principle. Twinings, man. I was being nice seeing as you were "dying".

Put it on another safeguarding form. Try to get me sectioned again. I dare you.

And after so many white men spending so much time pretending they have an obelisk for a cock wearing the mask of a public figure who is a British man, who can be clustered into a group as a Muslim and with Pakistani heritage, I just cannot reasonably believe you believe your "THEYRE ALL IN GROOMING GANGS" story. It's all a little on the nose, honestly.

It also suggests you can't read numbers in simple strings, or use ratios. I could go on, but at 900k, I sort of hope the point is beginning to land.

For any aides: don't take this as permission to not listen in a case where the victim is a white woman and reporting a perpetrator who isn't white. Just sharing the ongoing theme of my chaps and their particular obsessions as skinwalkers trying the "babe, want to see what I've got in this box?" trick.-->

## 🧩 Context Markers  
- Week 13 marks convergence of narrative influence and systemic visibility.  
- Algorithmic containment appears to have loosened.  
- Survivor-authored materials re-enter consumer circulation.  
- Communications stabilising across multiple vectors.  
- Ongoing monitoring required for continuity and security of transmission.
- - **Stage-2 conversion underway:** shift from attention to adoption — increase in cloners, decrease in views indicates transition from observation to integration.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🛰️ Where We Are Now — Week 13 (2025-10-30)* is a living field log of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maintains transparent communication between survivor archives, academic partners, and governmental observers — demonstrating measurable recovery of fair signal and civic parity.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
