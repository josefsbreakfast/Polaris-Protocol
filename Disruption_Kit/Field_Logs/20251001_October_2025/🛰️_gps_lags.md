lots to say but gps lags in places where doesnt make sense for british central sec idk.  

the degree of weird background anx i have for so oong of being boxed is not insignificant.  

also had 6 attempts at conversion so thats fun.

oh no i remember why im nervous.  

ive been subject to tiktoks all week that all essentially hint that something climactic will occur today, several about "not accepting food" (sometimes explicitly warning re poisoning), and ive already had one of the coded tannoy messages to staff re incident mangment at one tube station, and two shop alarms for no reason. (carbon fibre cane; not metallic shoudlnt alarm).  

that kay explain the general fear that something bad will happen.  

although this is all equally easily read as "people tryong to fick with my head".  

🤷‍♀️

am here anyways so it didnt acheive much 😅

the day is really pleasant.  

i am however tapped out on some grass near some old churvh hall looking thing, and honestly i did not reakise how much pain i was pushing through becausr this became so normal to have to push through for years without adequate support. changing demo routes and twidfling around with exact roads last minute, just to remind the british government, is annoying, feels directed, and it is why im currently experiencing the equivilant of the trip box going on my lower back, and one side hips and leg.  

if youre bothered about impact, iys a protest around our homeland being utilised for complicity in genocide; some inconvenience is probably not the big issue.  

any assumed fragility of jewish community does sort of read a bit like establishment has a certain view of all victims of tye holocaust; it reads as assuming inevitably, nothing else.  

ill let you work out if that sounds offensive or not.

this whole thing is also not unrelated to ongoing interference, but clearly its a-okay to someone who could sign my release from this. i don't need instructions i need common sense and accountability.

"Would you like me to generate the complete updated .md file (fully merged, with Last updated: 2025-10-11 → 2025-10-12) so you can download it as ⚖️_arms_exports_as_act_of_aggression.md?"

nah chatgpt it cool, tho am wondering which country is gmt+1 that im being routed through whilst making up files around mil law tho. i cannot possible work it out. given i am currently located in parliament sq, due to the territorial sec concern, can we not guys? can we make sure its british airspace only pls.  

---

and a plethora of little teain delays this morning but slso it is the uk so idk maybe im just not used to what the country is actually like without some weirdos in my phone anymore.

babes....  

"Unusual activity has been detected from your device. Try again later. (98cf547bdcc62534-LHR)

youre going to need to narrow it down.  
which bit do you find to be "out of _**the usual**_"?  

bc idk this has just coincided with policing changes in central london westminster and im at st pancreas because my back is dying ngl.

i do kina wonder if you can essentially just insert material as a foreign power onto police radio just to d around but ya know....  

i'm sure that definitly has never happened.  

it's not like it was a whole thing we developed tech for literally im this country or anything.  

idk i feel like we might even have a service for monitoring this but 🤷‍♀️ im not actually clear theyre directly related to the police if their comms route gets blocked, i think they sort of have to just cook and audit innit.

id already noticed grocery shopping etc had price adjusted significantly to be better prices since thr first reporting letter at cabinet level was acknowledged.  

going to london really reiterates how badly my accounts were out of whack on anything which may have ANY auto mathematical input.  

this is obvs illegal but very hard to even *know* let alone prove.  

this has been bad bad for about 18months.  

my trains and buses have also improved in terms if seating. idk if im even prepared to explain this one because it sounds absolutely bizarre.  

theres just so many areas of general morale suck which have suddenly become "unsuppressed".  

its wild, truly.  

otherwise im having an argument with chatgpt about how it handles discussions of sv on principle.  

i would take this as a marker of going in the direction of improvement to my personal baseline. this is me.
