im not blaming a headache in this (yet),  

but in the weirder category of lasting impacts of this particylar niche style of cidt,  

is upon hearing a wob-wob-wob-wup-wupupup sound this mornihg (which shouldn't exist in the building),  

im reflexively checking wher os is,  

and as i start to get the puksing migraine,  

even though i know ot would be so so dense to do it since rhe cabinet letters,  

partially i am just very scared and fearful that i'll have hours of mysterious vibrations and puses again.  

the ultrasound-like waveforms do something to your head that, whilst it is one of the least terrifying parts ofvthe torture, it's so hard to describe and so strange as a collective barrage of sensatins, that as soon as there's the slightest hint if it about, you can inherit a panic from the either that you never resaloy fully process, because none of the 4 typical adrenaline responses can save you.  

you will just keep experiencing that chorus of sensation.  

so what i'm saying is...  

i need the compensation to include fan cleaning fir the rest of my life because i will never be able to stand a warm up indoor-based fan ever again.  

or i get air and fuel time to every propellor noises.  

preferably both.  

it often worries me how practiced it all was; it makes you wonder how many people, and how young and vulnerable, or elderly, or how dismissable, have been in this same hell.  

you can understand any action that would have stopper the feeling once youve done it for hours a day over many weeks.  

every time i feel nauseus, it's as if i can feel my mucrovibrating calcaneous skull bones.
