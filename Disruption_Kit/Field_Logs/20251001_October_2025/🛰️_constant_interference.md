something I'm finding it frustrating at the moment, is that because of the way the data has probably been sold, if that's what's happened, there are likely quite a lot of different sources of surveillance and therefore a plethora of potential sources of interference.  

For example, some of it seems very personalised, and very event responsive, where some of it is so generalised.  

It's really really frustrating how many people and organisations are effectively just risk managing, but by risk managing their actively making the harms worse, which incidentally increases the tort exposure that they themselves have. It's ridiculous, it's not joined up, and it's siloed as all hell.  

I know something has changed in the last 24 hours in terms of the potential stack that I'm exposed to.  

This is a shame because they've taken away one of the nicer pieces again (this is the second time this has happened). While this is what I want ultimately, to be able to have as vanilla an experience as possible, on both occaisons it's the most official, most guard-railed, and most pleasant part of the stack that gets removed. You can see how this would be frustrating, when interference remains widespread, and when the content injection into feeds for example, remains to be a targeted narrative, bills not just undermine me but several others. current day it's going after a number of identifiable doctors, by using probably a combination of technology assisted nudging, to encourage them to look at some of my content in a way where I see their name, while putting out a generalised narrative of discreditinging into my feed. If someone was looking at that, not understanding how that can be produced technologically, this could realistically and reasonably be interpreted as worst faith, and as a patient currently, where a lot of these doctors currently are working in their trust, I could make complaints and they would end up going into that system. The reality of this is probably more that they've heard something on the grapevine, they may themselves have experienced targeted nudging, and as we used to be colleagues or students together, they have looked at my profile out of professional interest, but circumstantially this mechanism of (attempted) professional entrapment acts to divert attention away from the real places where accountability and transparency need to be placed.  

it's been normal for this to happen after my case might have hit a governance board for example. If you're reading this and you realise you might have done this yourself? honestly don't worry in this context. Save this if you want to. I understand professional curiosity it's not a problem. I advised against doing it in future, just because it's a really easy to see and it's really easy to track, and you never know who is tracking that, both terms of people unassociated with that person (my fleet of surveillance lads) all that the person made themselves be tracking Internet traffic because of other things happening in their life which mean they're watching more intently what's going on with their Internet presence. It's just worth noting. I have a weird discipline around this because of a place I used to work, my reputation management was really important to a number of people who would be data subjects. you're not unusual for having made this check, is what I'm saying. I know that a lot of things have come from natural human curiosity, and one of the weird and annoying side effects of being under surveillance at the extent that I have, means that it's harder than it would normally be to determine what is in good faith what is in bad faith and what is just natural curiosity. I understand that other people have no idea when I'm being fed constant hitler memes for example. we had a few today. It is what it is. It's probably aligned with a charity commission submission I made, because before the submission in the last 24 hours, it would've been reasonably obvious to anyone able to see the full screen on my device (through mirroring or through device level infiltration), that that submission was imminently likely to happen.  

The people who are usually discredited, or also consistently being discredited, and the impersonations are at least quite enough that it's unclear, if this is more results of data splicing placing Me into that person's feed, or several peoples feed, or whether this is echoes an algorithm from previous and impersonation via content injection.  

Some messages are pinging normally, close contants are not sounding normal notifications, so I miss the reach out of close contacts.
