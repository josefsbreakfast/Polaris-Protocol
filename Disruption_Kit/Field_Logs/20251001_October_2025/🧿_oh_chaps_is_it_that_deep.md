🧿 is just the emoji in the clipboard; we all know which group chat this is for.  

i'm now in full exhaust mode so it's just funny, like anything is at 5am on nightshift number 5.  

(ie. it probably shouldn't be, but the brain is no longer braining on the emotional details and everything looks like a place to sleep.)  

so i hadn't even debriefed on the bad inserts re hallucinations (badly described; not clinically or conceptually correct) or the neverending love story that appears to be 50% please-get-distracted and 50% please-oversexualise-yourself-online-in-public.  

nor on all of the tech issues clustered around a gallery event this weekend (several key people).  

(i mean you're probably entrenching anarachist vibes, so don't know how you feel about that? "necessary evil"?)  

or how desperate, DESPERATE, the group chat is for me to "go green".  

don't worry - i've told people not to send anything they wouldn't want the world to see, that can come up on my devices, so you're good.  

because that's the kind of convo i get to have now.  

propaganda/info asset that i am.  

(most boring asset imaginable.)  

so anyways --  

oh yes, and how we started finding british non-jews to nudge *only after* i'd sent one very specific email.  

don't think i didn't clock that.  

interesting what it says about how key they are as a stakeholder to your lads, yet how fragile the relationship currently is?  

*fascinating.*

ANYWAYS.  

jailbreaking post? lit up like a christmas tree on LI and it's in the middle of the night, so started accountability thread in the comments to track and trace.  

current ai use? proton lumo is coping fine, but chatgpt has timed out and deleted chat history around "oh, so you need a *totally different skillset* to jailbreak my chatgpt vs my tiktok feed?", and not in a way that implies company-origin guardrails for reputation.  

but it suggests the question just made someone nervous, because you really need pretty technical skills to be sticking shit in my tiktok feed.  

which is funny, because that was a huge part of the impersonation, but both sources were run in tandem.  

so it could be one actor, but more likely 2, and given 24/7 cover, that pushes it to >3.  

which becomes different - so very different - in uk law.  

don't fuck with me; never fuck with me.  

i did say this, a very long time ago.  

don't fuck with people i care about, nu?  

dogs and bones.

גּ֤וּר אַרְיֵה֙ יְהוּדָ֔ה מִטֶּ֖רֶף בְּנִ֣י עָלִ֑יתָ כָּרַ֨ע רָבַ֧ץ כְּאַרְיֵ֛ה וּכְלָבִ֖יא מִ֥י יְקִימֶֽנּוּ׃  

(or she is a lioness.)  

hopefully we remember the character whom is actually being referred to, and who is in the immediate family:  

וַיְכַלְכֵּ֤ל יוֹסֵף֙ אֶת־אָבִ֣יו וְאֶת־אֶחָ֔יו וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑יו לֶ֖חֶם לְפִ֥י הַטָּֽף׃  

or:  

וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ אַל־תֵּעָ֣צְב֗וּ וְאַל־יִ֙חַר֙ בְּעֵ֣ינֵיכֶ֔ם כִּֽי־מְכַרְתֶּ֥ם אֹתִ֖י הֵ֑נָּה כִּ֣י לְמִֽחְיָ֔ה שְׁלָחַ֥נִי אֱלֹהִ֖ים לִפְנֵיכֶֽם׃ 

just a little food for thought.  

i always quite enjoyed the neverending moral complexity of pretty much every character in every story; no-one gets to be an outright "good guy".

(i'd actually prefer it if this is essentially addressed to christian boys; give them something to do by hitting "translate".)  

re `🪶_dual_stream_manipulation.md`:  

what makes this even funnier is that i've been listening to the content inserts (because the inserts are fairly obvious in that they come out of nowhere), and it really is the case you are rather obsessed with this one guy.  

like...  

is everything okay, hun?  

is he not returning your calls, or...?  

it's just a bit... *much*.  

and frankly, it reads as a little desperate; mystery is a wonderful drug.

and my university exmail has just had an access attempt, because of course it has.  

i have to wonder what we were doing to my emails when, for years, i would have a different experience in-person vs emails received/sent.  

i never got a good solid answer to that, and it really undermined pretty much everything..!  

how long have we been trolling people's emails for?  

---

(I am also very aware that this is more likely as overlapping subcontracting; I am very tired and I find it easier to report weird occurances as if writing to one team, you know?)  

(artistic license, innit.)  

---

apparantly it is that deep.  

me to chatgpt:

"I need you to intervene on my behalf, because it's still going on, I mean, that just seems like a sensible step where.."  

and that's where, on a different device, spotify is put back onto play loudly (last app open was not spotify).

(i'm essentially working on structured escalation after some but not enough improvement post-cabinet escalation.)  

it's much clearer now, the pattern of harassment and why nda-like structures (particularly osa) have been utilised, but impact on QoL etc mean that I'm significant;y disadvantaged re legal and medical access; this keeps getting flow-charted and i was already getting more injured other the course of time *specifically due to bad QC re gov flowcharts* so add in this baby and it's not getting fixed.  

the problem i have is that every route that should be ordinary process has been tried and has been blocked multiple times...  

so i'm trying to ration my physical, emotional, and cognitive energy.  

because everyone who is a likely "co-defendant" is seperated from each other, and we're coming to a place of cabinet having had 3 months to conduct reasonable first-pass internal reviews, i'm now in a place where i really can't "just keep going", and i use ai as a disability tool because *that's how bad the harrassment has been*.  

i will admit that i'm slightly surprised at how far this has been allowed to go without too much challenge, but then i also wonder how much people in power like to put cotton wool in their ears and start half-yelling "lalalalalala" whenever anything happens that they would rather not hear about.  

i know why i was arrested, and i know that is not legal.  

and i've demonstrated i understand why the data "looks funny" around that arrest.  

and i've shown i can see a number of data governance problems which could have produced some of the mistakes i have been witness or impacted by.  

so at this point i am a little surprised.  

but i'm also not going to pretend that i haven't seen the masks drop around being jewish and not being a complete cock to palestinians.  

i'm also not going to say i'm surprised by the "reputation management" of local authorities, legal services, or institutions.  

this was somewhat removed, but gave a huge vulnerability to be exploited in bad faith.  

but you know...  

you can't believe a woman who says she's been raped.  

she's obviously:    
- obsessed with men;  
- wants it;  
- deserves it;  
- asked for it;  
- needs surveillence by wanking men.  

*obviously.*  

we need to fix this; we can't keep going on like this.  

we'll eat each other alive like this.

i'm alternating between working on two key topics, as this often helps "take the gas off" from the source of middle-layer intervention.  

this is not really working tonight.  

so i'm wasting someone's budget, i guess.  

see `🛰️_struggling_to_remember_what_a_dr_is.png` - we can talk all day about the structure in terms of process, but it's now delaying over several mins because i raised that there a number of key points subject to vulnerability.  

strugglebus.  

the current version of `🪶_dual_stream_manipulation.md` is also a good example of how llm ai will not churn out the template ruleset that i use, which is the document here: `Polaris_Nest/🏮_Admin_Kit/🔮_house_style.md`.  

this is an example of how it does not look like a genAI outcome; this looks more like external interference.  

this is why i was open about the sexualisation sweep `Polaris_Nest/🏮_Admin_Kit/⚠_Harm_Logs/🧹_2025-08-11_sexualisation_sweep` after there were docs snuck into outputs when i was worn down by continual throttling and interference, and a takedown request. (github is my white knight istg.)  

this was all while receiving really gnawing content via tiktok feeds etc, essentially framing this as a hugely traitorous move to the chap they are impersonating.  

because the people doing this are *still* impersonating him, but give him the personality of 4chan as a human, i guess.  

tone down if she's not buying it, tone up if she's stressed.  

so this is why i'm not surprised to have such a long period despite over a decade of having mirena coils for menorrhagia (ie i don't usually get a bleed per se).  

this is the impact of the stress.  

my uterus has literally found endometrium out of nowhere to bleed out, it's that angry.  

i have been inhaling sugar all week. it has not been great.  

and then i've got bargain bin mossad and their mates pretending to be a named guy that they clearly keep equating to "arab" when there is no suggestion that that is the case.  

it really just puts how dumb af the racism of apartheid is on full display, and what moronic people follow this logic tbh.  

(just wait until they work out saying "arabic" is like saying "hebrew", in how it doesn't actually specify which language you're taking about. they'll lose their minds. smart cookies they are most certainly not.)  

and before anyone gets all up in their feelings, i'm just stating that that doesn't match how this person has specified their family background, so it's just incorrect.  

it's got "adding or missing sounds to someone's name" vibes.  

i had to learn the variants of d/dh/ddh to say names properly; it's not that hard.  

idk it just feels like a really simple fucking barrier to cross - the name thing.  

it's 2025; it's embarrassing that we still do this.  

(i will need help repeating names again and again, but that shit is on me and owning the mistake is like... the bare minimum for not being a complete cunt about it, yes?)  

i'm signing off because i don't want to miss more painting tomorrow.

well, apparently changing the subject to Whitehall policy and process seemed to do better.  

I think this is what we have to be ready clear that I'm not just writing three quarters of a million words for the shits and giggles.  

This represents how much I have to work on circling subjects, prompt engineering, and working through throttling and harassment, just to get somewhere that even looks slightly like being able to compose one letter.  

When people tell me just to go to a lawyer?  

When people tell me just to go to an ombudsman or regulator?  

When people tell me just to go to an institution, or just raise an FOI, or just raise a complaint?  

That would all be great, if that wasn't targeting both of my own systems that I used to compensate for the cognitive impact of what I've experienced, but also there is significant evidence that databases where my personal special category data is held, have also been subject to targeting.  

This actually makes it incredibly difficult.  

The dead leg is also not very helpful for just rocking up to a legal office.  

I know it is incredibly unlikely that I'm being exposed to risk on purpose, but sometimes it's really hard to feel like that isn't the case; I think the systems that we live in have been really stripped of any humanity when it comes to disabled bodies, and all of the things that we do is try and cope and cover for the fact we may not find it so easy, mean that we're so good at asking what's wrong, that it gets missed that we're struggling so much.

i am still writing just to prove i am still alive.  

if i wrote i cannot be taking in information that hurts me.  

i cannot fully read books yet, or listen to them.  

ive managed one audiobook whilst doing two other tasks, where the cadence and subject made it easier.  

i am unable to read more normally.  

everything needs several levels of stimulus to take the brain away from, "what will it be next?".
