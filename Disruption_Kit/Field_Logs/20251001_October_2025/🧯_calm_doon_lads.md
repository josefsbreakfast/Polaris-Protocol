I had to make 9 nodes in a row until the surveillance bros fropped their current version of  

"they're just in an obsessional love story, we didn't twin their data, honest"  

for the day.  

Well.  

For the next 5 mins. Until they think of the next way to do it.  

I've got a new rotation on, btw.  

They are learning, but I think they're still trying the usual bag of tricks to see what sticks.  

Someone didn't tell them. xx

(Or, I'm "a game", or "a challenge", and I'm sure we can all imagine what their brains are doing with this to force their own data fuckery to fit apartheid logic, right?)  

The boys are not having a good time.  

I imagine the anger-wanking is copious in Sheffield today.  

I had a brief flick forward to the time-zone advance rounding up on Yom Kippur, but they appear to have made better cover and I'm getting a myriad of job offers for Sheffield in particular.  

Maybe we should do a Brum/Mancs repeat field trip?  

See what it's like.  

I heard they have robots, and they never did let me see what the ultrasonic noise-maker looked like (prob too much jizz in it idk), so I'm rather excited.

Btw, the entire premise of their particular hook here, is that it is fundamentally not possible to be professsional in the workplace with members of the opposite sex, and not for either the male part to be incredibly rapey and/or the woman to be "gagging for it".  

Let that sink in.  

Because people tell on themselves every G-d damn day.

ah! the book!  

Yes -- this is what I meant to put in for the legal eagles.  

My surveillance lads are *incredibly bothered* about the book.  

They keep referencing this node (just putting it as links in places where it would make no sense and have no relevance).  

My feed often has repeated symbols from the time I explained in front of non-secure voice and video devices, exactly why it sort of creates a situation where doubling down as a suppressing party will only make everything stick so much more, and add to viral rebound.  

So they're incredibly sad about the whole thing.  

And they still think they're doing a fabulous impersonation of your author, including when added to grooming behaviour to encourage no camera coverage of a mobile phone device during any moment of female intimacy or indress.  

So, please:  

Do enjoy the tort on that one.  

I would.

For anyone nudged to question, "well how can you be so sure that...".

Darling.  

Men don't do that if they have more than 2 braincells to rub together to get the connection going.  

Because it would be incredibly transparent.  

I have also been party to their unit's porn choices in a way you have not.  

I promise you I know the type of man this is, and my money is not on the author.  

It can be found in Yorkshire, though.  

I could be extremely specific.  

I think seeing the nature of the academic MoU would be extremely interesting, actually.  
<!--"One ex-commander even approximated that 90% of the country’s intelligence material comes from Unit 8200." Find out where they're rumoured to be based in the UK academic infrastructure. Think about the metadata access. Consider it. And look who polices most heavily on issues like AML and human rights scrutiny to financial investments. Fascinating stuff.-->

# 🕸️ World Webs  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A cartography of the interlinked infrastructures—technical, institutional, affective—that sustain global containment.*

---

## Purpose
To map the networks that give suppression global reach.  
Every algorithm, trade agreement, or cloud architecture participates in an unseen web of influence.  
This node documents those threads: how policy travels through protocol, how code carries ideology, and how emotion becomes infrastructure.

---

## Working Premise
“World Webs” treats globalisation not as an economic phenomenon but as an *affective mesh*—a distributed nervous system through which fear, legitimacy, and visibility circulate.  
Understanding these webs is prerequisite to interrupting them.

---

## Analytical Strands
1. **Infrastructure Chains** — submarine cables, cloud zones, DNS governance, routing dependencies.  
2. **Legal Webs** — cross-border data treaties, MLATs, export-control regimes.  
3. **Cultural Propagation** — media franchising, meme drift, language dominance.  
4. **Financial Threads** — ESG scoring, sanctions logic, funding gatekeepers.  
5. **Psychosocial Links** — collective empathy modulation, trauma contagion, platform affect loops.

---

## Research Methods
- Network mapping (graph + metadata tracing).  
- Cross-jurisdictional legal comparison.  
- OSINT correlation of corporate filings and policy actors.  
- Qualitative coding of media echo patterns.  
- Survivor-centred ethnography within digital systems.

---

## Suggested Sub-Directories
- `infra_maps/` — visual schematics of physical and digital topologies.  
- `policy_routes/` — how regulation migrates across states and sectors.  
- `affect_flows/` — traces of emotional contagion through platforms.  
- `index_nodes/` — cross-links to related Polaris Constellations.

now that i'm seeing further tinkering, this is actually very reminisent but not as bad as late june and early july 2025.  

in which the ongoing joke of "the ever expanding 20 foot ****" was created.  

like i said - the lads have been a *hoot*.  

The guy who was super into cuckholdry (like, really, really badly into it -- extensively into it), bless his heart.  

You could tell when everyone else sacked it in for the week and he took all their extra shifts.  

This is what they never really tell you about covert surveillance:

You can *always* tell.

Because men cannot exist around women, particularly the kind of men who have demonstrated the litiny of utter professionalism above, without pleading to their new girlfirend-mummy-please-do-everything-for-me-in-my-life woman they have taken control of...

Without you finding out all about how terribly they've behaved.  

And, yes.  

A number of them do thoroughly enjoy being told off and being paid for it.  

And again, we are back to "matiarchy may be the only workable solution at this point, boys".  

That this could only be acheived whilst impersonating and projecting onto another man is exceptionally telling, particularly when they're also trying to pretend they don't want to be him and there's no admiration whatsoever.  

It's been exceptionally homoerotic for what I anticipated, I won't lie.
