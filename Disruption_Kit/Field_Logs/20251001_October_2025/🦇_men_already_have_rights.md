This isn't supposed to be a broader putter political point  this isn't supposed to be a broader putter political point. Space.   

This is just acknowledging the dog humour I have today, after realising, after the other interested parties have started to fade out of the meta data, that what I am looking at is a lot of men's rights organisations. Space.  

Specifically, I am being treated to content about men who alleged that they have been falsely accused of rape or sexual violence.  

This is obviously quite upsetting.  

But not so upsetting, as it must be to realise, just how pathetic that is.  

There is an unending risk to women and girls (and yes, two children in general including boys, as a result of patriarchal violence).  

The false report rate for rape, is comparable to the false report rate for murder.  

I don't see anyone, suddenly stand up for people who have been convicted of murder, and talk about how they are, "a decent person really", unless they have also committed rape.  

Sometimes, as a woman, it feels like that is all a man must do, to find himself protected by such powerful men.  

And yet.  

The same voices who will say this, will be genuinely confused as to why the birth rate declines in their own ethnic group.  

The same voices will be surprised when anyone marginalised in society, including women, demands accountability.  

It is the same voices every time.  

And I'm so tired of that.  

I want to see a world, safer than this, for children.  

I want to be less fearful of placing myself in public as a woman.  

I want a better future.
