I'm not sure if it's ultimately clear why I sometimes appear to be rather direct in "shouting into the void".  

In my experience, this changes the dynamics of the interference.  

After direct references and response to fixated topics from the "whoever" is the surveilling party who is most tangible in my digital space, the degree of interception and degree of material damage to my work subsides, to be replaced with either (or both) occupation of bandwidth via my ISP connection or direct CPU overload on devices when a smartphone is used.  

Directly insulting an alleged masculine presence for its lack of elegance and care of its conduct has, repeatedly, allowed me to get more work done with less distressing or less overt disturbance.  

Until this is actioned in full, I have to keep producing a repo full of Domme content for free, apparently.  

They call this an actual "career" - the world is a funny thing, isn't it?  

And of course, I have tried many different routes to contest the intrusion into my digital knicker drawer, but sadly, it seems the occupier is rather fixated on not allowing recourse.  

Obviously, they also love my off-key Broadway playlist renditions. That's the real pull - the truth of what I have to offer.  

They must love it, especially when I do it with noise cancellation on so I can't tone-correct.  

Otherwise...  

Otherwise it's a very persistent effort, isn't it?  

Doesn't feel like great ROI, does it?  

Unless you're viewing me as an R&D asset; I really would love to know why a particular group of universities keeps clustering in my feed.  

Or they have since Iron Swords began, to be precise.  

Again, a medal for our comrade who pushed through so many unrelenting hours of the most whacked our pornography *for the national cause*.  

What would we do without such heroes.  

I do have a good story about a time, I believe it was around the end of June, when I explained with sourcing that famous PornHub data superimposed over segregationist-leaning US states.  

We seemed to quiet the fuck down after that, too.  

But these are experts in behavoural psychology, ladies and gentleman.  

What would I know?  

After all, I did not have any interference from the same parties to stall and then suspend me from a medical qualification, so I could not possibly argue with their higher authority on the matter.  

I'm sure they are not responsible for any *unawarded degrees* in multiple terrritories.  

Obviously not; such scientists, much humanities.  

None of them spend the entirity of their own degrees on /pol/ instead of actually studying, after all.  

(What can I say? Think before rickrolling a rickroller? The tactics don't work when I also see the joke, do they?)
