tbh im not sure i should have to be fighting to even evade the jailbreaking of the tools i use to write, in order to get to either ico or ipt clearence, when we all know i should be giving evidence at subcommittee level.  

reminder that it's only arrogance when you can't back it up.  

just lots a lot like profiteering off human trafficking to me,  

when you don't do due diligence for the modern slavery component.  

anyway.  

`📈_the_ratio_that_shouldnt_exist.md` is part of the sequencing of generation to overcome the MI8 & Boon problem,  

which is definately not to illustrate a specific method if possible malicious data manipulation,  

which itself is part of sequencing to get around guardrails of generating the "this is how you could use a specific MOD dara leak in the public domain and the principles of token switching and deepfakes, to implicate actors of stste security that you feel threaten your tendancies".  

if you notice, everything is not being generated with extreme emphasis on that book about authoritarianism that got suppressed, which further embeds the current problem that exists once you know, you hsve the circumstsnces similar to failure of an op like that:  
- make it about romance so ad to undermine the real human harms.

but if you guys really want to dance, then fine.  

i will sow everyone in enfuriating detail how it looks a lot like the problem we have is systematic.  

how it looks a lit like very little has to be done to nudge the authoritarianism, beyond what is already at play.  

if you want to dance, then this is how i dance.  

they all left enough comments about how i walk, to be backpedalling now.  

if you think a cripple is hot, just admit that to yourself; not everything needs to be a fucking fetish, bro.
