it's taken the best part of 2 hours to take a fully formed idea and essentially hit "print".  

this is targeted interference.  

audit inc nhs token switching, death audits, and audit of cop/dols for systematic abuse.  

Paticular difficulty (40min+) to print this:

Polaris-Protocol/Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/🕯_Exorcising_Safeguarding_Shadows/audit_legal/🧵_paper_as_containment_audit.md

Extremely sensitive to issues that frontlone staff come across frequently (tricounty/county boundaries).  

This is made worse by policial gerrymandering and is not uncommon in local area here.  

Boundary changing protects perpetrators via confusion of data sets and allows abuse to remian hidden on audit.
