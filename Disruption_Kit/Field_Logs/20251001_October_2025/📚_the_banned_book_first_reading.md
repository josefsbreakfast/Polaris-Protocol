i can practically list the interested parties in the suppression itself; this was suppressed because of who it spoke to and why, and how that may have changed 2022 - now.  

the answer in a domestic uk sense is esentially pp508-509 of k-punk. (i read how i read; it works for me.)  

"UKIP kept were also practically forced on them to [elect] by a political media so decadent, so boring, that it counts Nigel Farage as a charismatic flash of colour."  

"The only party that could call on a massive popular enthusiasm in the UK was the SNP. That popular enthusiasm -- an enthusiasm that capitalist realism is set up to prevent emerging -- is the rushing in of something that, for a long time, that hasn't seem to be any glimmer of in England: the future."  

cf:  

"Nor can you really blame people for being attracted to the type of politician who assures them that these problems are not of their making but a product of 'elites', 'immigrants' and globalisation -- because if we are honest, in most cases, these problems really were not of the making of the ordinary people who suffered them."  

"This turn in the political tides will not affect just ordinary individuals."

I thought for some time that we were really looking at here is a new take on the Cassandra problem; it is not so much that we have a lack of people seeing, or a lack of people who would hear, but the people who are in the middle -- the translators -- are the ones who are at risk.  

I've seen many people you are active in politics. You are targeted for their views or targeted for their charisma; what I think we seeing is a very specialised target targeting.  

In order to direct resources for minimal loss and maximum impact, dating in the same real behaviour on the church is being used as a basis, to direct specific efforts to disrupt the new mechanics of memetic travel.  

Whilst of you see, our world is in a profoundly difficult place, and by no means am I saying that everyone's pain is somehow a lot easier simply because we are further along in the story, but I don't think this should spell an absolute despair.  

This is not disaster.  

The same parties who are doing this, or also woefully misunderstanding quite a lot of the science, and themselves appear to have taken up either outright pseudoscience or extremely biased forms of science.  

When one must use science to defeat another, this does come in some use.  

One of my favourite facts about the Nazis, is that they were so racist, that they either murdered or expelled all of their best scientists. Be believing themselves instead to be pure and Aryan, and therefore the real great minds, they was wasted so much time and resource doing incredibly ridiculous stuff, because they fundamentally didn't understand the physics required to actually advance nuclear thermodynamics.  

*The minyan wins again.*  

I will put to the gathering slightly better terms, and contributing mobile rounded way. Essentially what I'm saying is that antifascism is still very possible, and I can promise you, that there are a lot of resistances and a lot of ways of resisting some of the most brutal regimes in the world in human history, that you just don't know about because you haven't heard about it.  

The beauty and this is that if you see enough fascists, enough totalitarians, and enough authoritarians...  

They are not as innovative as we are.  

Nor do they have the poets.  

Creativity is not their strong suit.  

They only seem to manage any of these when they're fuelled to produce violence;  

They are actually quite incapable left to their own devices, I'm just ordinary prosocial society building and community upkeep.  

This gives us some really cool and obvious vulnerabilities and countermeasures.  

No pasáran.
