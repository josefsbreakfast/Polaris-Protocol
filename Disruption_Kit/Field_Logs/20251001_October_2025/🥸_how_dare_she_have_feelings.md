it always fascinates me


You can literally be pissed off once, and the men will often act as if the world is about to implode

I'm expressing anger that I've had to hold onto for a long time


I've been trying so hard to negotiate with stakeholders who are withholding information from Me

I'm trying to negotiate with desperate stakeholders

I'm doing this whilst probably also being failed under our IPA or IPA warranting

But apparently

One of them are unhinged male personas in my algorithm


A white man of course

So many of them are children

Is repeatedly sending me a mix of hugely emotional content, as well as tarot readings, which may inadvertently be disclosing business confidential arrangements

Who knows maybe it's the surveillance team

Anyway

A human being cannot also be an intellectual property asset that you did not consent for in UK law

If you fucked it, that's on you

Stop sending me a mixture of Heidi amount of content about wedding dresses children you know that I don't have because I haven't been able to give birth because of what I've gone through (at the present time at least), and highly emotional stories which hinge on my behaviour becoming more placid and compliant and working hard harder to please men like you


I am not interested

If the choice was to tone myself down or die alone?

Then I would die in peace.

I have no interest in pandering to the emotional immaturity of someone who apparently is supposed to have status as a legal adult.

The idea that so many of the people involved in the most emotionally expressive and chaotic miss handling, are not only a little bit older than me, but older and more senior in careers?


No wonder the economy is fucking tanking.

Stop recommending what I should be doing with my emotional control, and get the help you need for yourself.

Get the fuck out of my feed, get the fuck out of my life, and frankly if you do not have anything productive to offer me in terms of negotiating around what I am still going through and damages for what I have gone through?

I do not need to hear from you.

In absolutely any capacity whatsoever.
