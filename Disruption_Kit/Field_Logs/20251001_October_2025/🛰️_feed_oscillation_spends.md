My favourite thing about this is that now I know I didn't "cause" this by being outspoken; my voice just made me more urgent to address as a risk.  

Long before that, we had enough investment in bad actions.

I can see why neighbourhood policing was like... yeah, we're out.  

This has got far more to do with data practices under the Blair cabinet era, in terms of origin.
