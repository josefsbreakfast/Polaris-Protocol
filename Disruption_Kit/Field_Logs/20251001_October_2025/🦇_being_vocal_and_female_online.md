taking out the last of the trash.  

thanks for the ideas.  

but also...  

no fucking wonder none of you got consent.  

you think this shit is suddenly going to pit you on the, "why yes, i would not hate making babies with that man" list?  

i've worked in kids healthcare where some of the extra work we had to do because of people like you guys?  

seriously there are better ways to spend your money;  

there is never "no" evidence.  

y'all could cut your losses and invest in transformative justice because that will still CYA by comparison but NOPE.  
apparantly you're all such good little boys that you can't stand to engage in kingian non-violence and repair, so *here we are*.  

i just thought the testosterone might kick in at some point and you migght want to get a consensual shag at some point, but w/e.

literally the same men puzzling out why women aren't queuing up to suck theor unwashed dicks.  

the venn diagram is practically a circle.  

pro dating tip:  

when our vibe check even hints at "maybe engages in pornographic search poisioning of a csa rape survivor", our entire genital tracts sort of dehydrate like those fancy mushrooms you get at the supermarket.  

it's just biology, guys.  

i thought you understood how some things are, "just biology, bro".  

...oh, wait...  

that's your pseudoscientic take on developmental biology and dna physics.  
riiiight.  

maybe we need sone stem courses and a metaphorical bat big enough to beat it into your brains, idk.  

for all this "birth rate" talk, i ain't seen any ACTUAL USEFUL BEHAVIOUR TO SUPPORT THAT INCREASING from your side.  

"white genocide"?  

more like "still obsessed with the woman who said no at the high school dance".  

it's reading very "Vladimir Nabokov", and trust me:  

that is not what you want to be projecting to The Women™️.

tbh,  

i've just sat through a feed on search that is basically screaming what you don't want me to say.  

a fool becomes his own informant.  

and no...  

you will never find a man who can psycholigically "win" me by force.  

long-term surveillance squad members (worling on the merch) will note the "mr sun" and "mr wind" story...  

it is the one who is kind that gets the human to take their coat off.  

force only makes the coat-wearer wrap the coat tighter around their own skin.  

funny how it all links, no?
