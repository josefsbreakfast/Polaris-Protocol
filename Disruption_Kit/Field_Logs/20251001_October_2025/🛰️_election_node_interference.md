i could have thrown both the old brick laptop and the mobile phone out of the window; lag all over the place and delays on delays.  

absolute ballache.  

therefore most of intended content missing to cover whole issue.  

i am not subjecting myself to even more stress.  

<!--also i thought the "c" was supposed to be in chis; find your leak or pay me what i'm worth.-->

update the TikTok feed is literally hilarious.  

The surveillance squad have changed shifts, or they've rotated and handed over. this still narratives, they're trying to push an hour basically going through the motions of what they've already gone through before.  

This is really funny because now we've got two separate people who are likely under OSA/SC here they are essentially directing libellous/defamatory content about.  

This really speaks to the brevity that the handover notes must have; Bargin Bin Mossad strikes again.  

The funniest thing about all of this, is that my Hebrew name is unironically inspired by a character from a TV show. I know. I am that uncool. And I was that uninformed.  

For all that people see me as this scary antizionist, I'm not by any means perfect in that regard, and it's not as if I haven't been through a process of unlearning things.  

Just as I haven't changed my names that I've clearly gotten from someone in prison, I also haven't changed my name that I chose after a character very clearly placed as soft hasbara.  

I like my Hebrew name; I chose it.  

But it is making it into a slight bit of a joke, that the surveillance story runs at least in part, from my organising around bringing the UK into compliance with the Geneva conventions and the genocide convention, in line with the ICJ ruling, and therefore this state the tiniest chance that some of the directive stems from what was supposedly an elite force. Thanks to the operation being largely conducted here, or perhaps some slightly overzealous advertising and poor expectations management, here we have: the Bargain Bin version.  

I just kind of hope that they're not involved in any way because the way our government goes on, it's like we're protecting the SAS or the Marines in that sort of mythic space, and if any of the above are involved, then quite frankly I am quite embarrassed.  

The specific nature of my embarrassment would be that, this operational plan was not made for this amount of time, and as much as it is incredibly distressing to go through what I have been through, it's also very see-through. It's not particularly flash. I think I was just expecting something more impressive.  

This is why in the back of my mind, I'm like yeah I get that this is theoretically possible, but I honestly just don't believe that that's it.  

And guys, if any of you are involved?  

Fucking hell.  

That's all I'm saying.

I feel like from the surveillance leaking that I'm getting at the moment, but I need to clarify where the apparent ballsiness comes from.  

It's not that I'm not scared at all; I've spent too much time crying down the phone to police, absolutely terrified that some bloke is going to come in my house and hurt me.  

There were only so many times where that can happen and you get absolutely no help, where you go one of two ways. You either learn the helplessness, which is completely understandable and shouldn't be shamed. Alternatively. There are some people who are just batshit, in the colloquial sense of the word, in the same sort of way that for example one might apply to DSFC when they were a teenager, that kind of batshit -- and those people might learn that there's effectively no point in stopping because you're scared. Those people might learn that boldness at least means you don't have to die on your knees. Those people might learn that fighting is at least more dignified than going quietly. Most importantly, those people might notice that being a "good girl" (frequently used, I might add, without my consent during my surveillance), is essentially useless, doesn't get anything done, and so sometimes in life one needs to be prepared to be disliked by The Men™️. Person that I find that so much more liberating position to be in. So much of our lives as women they spent being nice to men because not being perfectly nice to them can get you killed. If you're in a situation where that doesn't really seem to be making a difference? At least you can be yourself.  

Whilst I've rarely had a feeling of really being safe, in the sense of actual physical safety, having the absolute opposite of it has allowed me to move through this world as if nothing is going to change whether I live or die, and that has been true freedom, in a spiritual sense.  

This is not remove the fact that I would like my freedom in a legal sense, before some of us start getting ideas.  

And to answer something else from the feed?  

No.  

I do not need to "slow down".  

What you are experiencing, is your own fault, as you have been so keen as a group to say to me continuously for so long.  

If a girl is beating you?  

That is your own fault.  

So pick up the pace, stop whining, and keep up.
