# 🛰️ Delay Script Field Log — 2025-09-29  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Field evidence of procedural delay scripting around critical deadlines.*

---

## 🧾 Summary  

This log captures direct observations, timestamps, and communication excerpts showing how **institutional delay** is deployed to suppress exposure.  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [⏳ Delay Scripts Near Deadlines](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/⏳_delay_scripts_near_deadlines.md).

## 🕰 Observation Template  

| Timestamp (ISO8601) | Actor / Dept | Action or Communication | Delay Mechanism | Evidence Type | Notes |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:------------------------|:----------------|:---------------|:------|
| 2025-09-27T11:32Z | Compliance Officer | “We’ll need three months to check duplicates.” | Workflow flag — artificial timeline extension | Email screenshot | Flag created post-deadline notice. |
| 2025-09-28T16:04Z | Records Admin | “We’re still waiting for authorisation.” | Accountability deferral | Call note | Multiple authorisations already logged. |

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Delay trigger proximity:** most delays appear within **5–10 days** of exposure deadlines.  
- **Lexical camouflage:** recurrent phrases — “just a glitch,” “routine check,” “complex case.”  
- **Energy management:** micro-responses designed to *sap urgency* or create self-doubt.  

---

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Cross-match timestamps with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) for parallel UI or upload failures.  
- Compare wording with [🧠 Psychological Containment](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/) nodes for pattern replication.  
- Flag any **deadline shifts** authorised after internal awareness of anomaly.
