I have just received the best evasion by SAR so far and it is beautiful.  

I could talk about sidestepping scope, but more interestingly:  

The UK's key policy paper on antisemitism on campus now comes from a think tank which completely denied to one of the only Jewish voices on legal record about whether a Palestine protest was antisemitic, that any data artefact around them as a subject has ever been processed on behalf of the controller.  

(Crawer activity has suddenly dropped significantly, incidently.)  

So are we admitting we deliberately limit our research data points to only ever represent the Jews who say what we want them to say, or are we doing CYA in case of torts?  

For anyone out of the whole loop, if the SAR response was 100% accurate, the following would also be true:  

*A keystone paper on campus antisemitism that excludes judicially tested Jewish testimony on the precise question it seeks to answer has a methodological problem, regardless of its compliance posture.*  

Either the SAR is flawed, or the paper's research methodology is flawed, because I am one of the Jewish voices in [2024] EWHC 1771 (KB).  

This is *fascinating*.  

It feels very reminiscent of when [these](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2025/04/harvard-antisemitism-anti-muslim-report-findings) were released, and I am happy to node it, because there is *a lot* to say about that pair of reports, even though there was an effort to include Jewish voices not aligned with Zionism.  

I am emotionally tired of white Western goyim trying to impose what Judaism means onto me; that should be a job for my Matriarchs, not for these chaps.  

(And of course I get the email during Hanukkah, 3 days after the Bondi Beach attacks, despite this being incongruent with existing SAR timelines, because why would we have any actual cultural understanding or empathy for Jewish women. Especially Jewish women who have stood up in rape trials; no one has ever used that as a narrative device to justify anything bad, ever.)

To the lawyers, compliance experts, and risk management crowd:  

Glad you're able to find me after I moved the majority of my work from LinkedIn to GitHub.  

When assessing this speech, please note the level of inherent duress a Jewish rape survivor with evidence of downstream data harms now has to write under.  

Respectfully, if Western governments had tokenised my story less in narrativisng why we assisted a specific genocide alledged at ICJ level, I may not be so inherently stressed.  

(I am also revoking everyone's "one free Holocaust question for the Jew" card. Again.)  

I am not asserting that this data controller is the source of all difficulties, quite far from it; I am simply using Grecian logic systems to deduce that there are two realities which cannot simutaneously be true.  

I also know how many email responses go through counsel, so I know this is not personal to anyone specific in the chain as an individual, necessarily.  

I am just tired of white people being white people; I've been especially tired of this since October 2023.

אַ מענטש האָט אַמאָל געזאָגט:  

נײַן רבנים קענען קײן מנין ניט מאַכן אָבער צען שוסטערס יאָ.  

אויטאָריטעט? פֿאַר וואָס? כאַפּן הינער?  

אזוי, אזוי.  

At least it is getting clearer where and how I need to concentrate the data hunting; it's a telling play.
