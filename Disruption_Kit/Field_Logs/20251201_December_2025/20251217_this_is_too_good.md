I have just received the best evasion by SAR so far and it is beautiful.  

I could talk about sidestepping scope, but more interestingly:  

The UK's key policy paper on antisemitism on campus now comes from a think tank which completely denied to one of the only Jewish voices on legal record about whether a Palestine protest was antisemitic, that any data artefact around them as a subject has ever been processed on behalf of the controller.  

(Crawer activity has suddenly dropped significantly, incidently.)  

So are we admitting we deliberately limit our research data points to only ever represent the Jews who say what we want them to say, or are we doing CYA in case of torts?  

For anyone out of the whole loop, if the SAR response was 100% accurate, the following would also be true:  

*A keystone paper on campus antisemitism that excludes judicially tested Jewish testimony on the precise question it seeks to answer has a methodological problem, regardless of its compliance posture.*  

Either the SAR is flawed, or the paper's research methodology is flawed, because I am one of the Jewish voices in [2024] EWHC 1771 (KB).  

This is *fascinating*.  

It feels very reminiscent of when [these](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2025/04/harvard-antisemitism-anti-muslim-report-findings) were released, and I am happy to node it, because there is *a lot* to say about that pair of reports, even though there was an effort to include Jewish voices not aligned with Zionism.  

I am emotionally tired of white Western goyim trying to impose what Judaism means onto me; that should be a job for my Matriarchs, not for these chaps.  

(And of course I get the email during Hanukkah, 3 days after the Bondi Beach attacks, despite this being incongruent with existing SAR timelines, because why would we have any actual cultural understanding or empathy for Jewish women. Especially Jewish women who have stood up in rape trials; no one has ever used that as a narrative device to justify anything bad, ever.)
