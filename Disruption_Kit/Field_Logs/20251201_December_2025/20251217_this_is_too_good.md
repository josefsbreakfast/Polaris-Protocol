I have just received the best evasion by SAR so far and it is beautiful.  

I could talk about sidestepping scope, but more interestingly:  

The UK's key policy paper on antisemitism on campus now comes from a think tank which completely denied to one of the only Jewish voices on legal record about whether a Palestine protest was antisemitic, that any data artefact around them as a subject has ever been processed on behalf of the controller.  

(Crawer activity has suddenly dropped significantly, incidently.)  

So are we admitting we deliberately limit our research data points to only ever represent the Jews who say what we want them to say, or are we doing CYA in case of torts?  

For anyone out of the whole loop, if the SAR response was 100% accurate, the following would also be true:  

*A keystone paper on campus antisemitism that excludes judicially tested Jewish testimony on the precise question it seeks to answer has a methodological problem, regardless of its compliance posture.*  

Either the SAR is flawed, or the paper's research methodology is flawed, because I am one of the Jewish voices in [2024] EWHC 1771 (KB).  

This is *fascinating*.  

It feels very reminiscent of when [these](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2025/04/harvard-antisemitism-anti-muslim-report-findings) were released, and I am happy to node it, because there is *a lot* to say about that pair of reports, even though there was an effort to include Jewish voices not aligned with Zionism.  

I am emotionally tired of white Western goyim trying to impose what Judaism means onto me; that should be a job for my Matriarchs, not for these chaps.  

(And of course I get the email during Hanukkah, 3 days after the Bondi Beach attacks, despite this being incongruent with existing SAR timelines, because why would we have any actual cultural understanding or empathy for Jewish women. Especially Jewish women who have stood up in rape trials; no one has ever used that as a narrative device to justify anything bad, ever.)

To the lawyers, compliance experts, and risk management crowd:  

Glad you're able to find me after I moved the majority of my work from LinkedIn to GitHub.  

When assessing this speech, please note the level of inherent duress a Jewish rape survivor with evidence of downstream data harms now has to write under.  

Respectfully, if Western governments had tokenised my story less in narrativisng why we assisted a specific genocide alledged at ICJ level, I may not be so inherently stressed.  

(I am also revoking everyone's "one free Holocaust question for the Jew" card. Again.)  

I am not asserting that this data controller is the source of all difficulties, quite far from it; I am simply using Grecian logic systems to deduce that there are two realities which cannot simutaneously be true.  

I also know how many email responses go through counsel, so I know this is not personal to anyone specific in the chain as an individual, necessarily.  

I am just tired of white people being white people; I've been especially tired of this since October 2023.

אַ מענטש האָט אַמאָל געזאָגט:  

נײַן רבנים קענען קײן מנין ניט מאַכן אָבער צען שוסטערס יאָ.  

אויטאָריטעט? פֿאַר וואָס? כאַפּן הינער?  

אזוי, אזוי.  

At least it is getting clearer where and how I need to concentrate the data hunting; it's a telling play.

Updating:  

Attached two screenshots of two timepoints where Azure AD level of university account flags access or viewing.  

One after one weird SAR response, one after another weird SAR response. Both belong to political policy ecosystem; both appear to be engaging external stakeholders as major factor, both correlate with crawler behaviour; both are sidestepping third party, derivative, and inference data.  

This is consistent with longstanding patterns of error message; access correlates with significant points of paperwork access or significant paperwork drafting, digitally.  

The risk of having my address in that King's bench case and also the risk posed by the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs' policies and procedures, in respect to me as a Jewish woman (regardless of the fact that I'm supposed to be exclusively British), are so systematically ignored by British white people, that sometimes it feels like there is no point in having the risk matrix conversation.  

What feels particularly ridiculous, is how this completely flies in the face of what is supposed to be protected by the IHRA definition of antisemitism.  

I want to be really clear to anyone reading this thinking that I'm so critical of Israel - this is not the case.  

I want to be really clear that I don't simply blame Israel, not at all.  

I am very clear in my blame regarding the State of Israel in respect of war crimes and genocide. This is different.

This is the antisemitism that British white people don't want to talk about.  
White British people will use Israel as a prop to get out of having to answer Jewish people within Britain; the only Judaism they will accept is a colonised Judaism, modelled after them.  

(As I'm writing this, there are substantial issues with dictation where sentences keep getting deleted, without a clear UX reason. Fascinating times.)  

I'm going to clarify that my experience of what white people are like, comes as experiencing in the world for the vast majority of my life as a white person; as well as being Jewish, there are other reasons that racists may use to bring me out of whiteness, and since October 2023 I've spent the vast majority of my life outside of whiteness.  

It has been a time.  

What really bothers me about this whole query around? My data is that it is very clear because of the downstream harms and the downstream changes in my life, that data has been used inappropriately.  

My concern is not so much that lots of people were knowing in using this data, although that is possible, but rather that in order for a type of harms to have arisen, there would need to be a lot of failure of due diligence, failure of cyber security (and we're talking like basic cybersecurity for organisations proportional to the size of the data controller as I'm thinking of; I'm not talking about crazy advanced stuff), and this consistent problem where I keep having to explain, in great detail, the legal status of how I belong to the UK and I expressed you do not belong to the state of Israel.  

That last bit is the antisemitism.  

Politicians have been flogging that dead horse for the last two years non-stop, as have senior figures in policing.  

It's not a secret that policing and security industry have significant business ties with similar industry and similar services within the State of Israel; this is well evidenced and well researched academically and from long-form and investigative journalism.  

This is not a million miles away from the conversation around the formation of the Republic of Ireland and also the conversation around The Troubles in Northern Ireland afterwards.  

This is a real shame and it discredits UK policing as a whole.  

It is repeatedly very upsetting to me than a number of organisations or essentially in lockdown over the legal side of their story. These are organisations and bodies who have claimed to represent and protect Jewish women and Jewish women safety from sexual violence following October 2023.  

The failure could not be more stark.  

I'm not claiming any exceptionalism based on my identity; I am expressly advocating for the ability to be treated just as any other group, and not to be exceptionalised, because that exceptionalism has brought me more harm, more risk, and more injury, than if I just carried on existing as a generic white person.  

This is the bit about racism that a lot of people seem to refuse to understand; asking for freedom from being racialised is not asking for an exception, but rather it is asking not to be the exception.  

when organisations and individuals claim that they are protecting Jewish people and Jewish women under the IHRA, but repeatedly favour, a political narrative which is conducive to the State itself of Israel (Medinat), and not the People (Am) or the House of Israel (Kol), this is inherently antisemitic. Rather than question data sharing and adhere to legal compliance, it appears that several organisations may have instead decided it was easier to assume dual loyalty.  

What is really upsetting, is that there is a realistic chance that I have either been profiled, or have been claimed to be a dual national, and there is the potential that people have to accepted that claim, without asking me, without consulting, and to use that information to harm others as well.  

It is maddening.
