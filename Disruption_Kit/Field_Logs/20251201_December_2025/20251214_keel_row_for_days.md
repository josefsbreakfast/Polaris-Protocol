I'm experiencing something in most of my usage, which is presenting as content along the lines of "I love you alright, stop being difficult" on social feeds, and presenting as strange errors which shouldn't occur on new sessions on the LLM.  

The LLM errors are small switches, changing cases, switching fork choices in a decision tree, so that the working output is nonsensical.  

I can see *why* my recent posting might attract this, but it's difficult to sort of figure out the point aside from trolling.  

It seems a bit too amateur-time-burn for anything professional; v. LSSO.  

On the plus side, correcting the errors is very useful as a sort of "live quiz" of the fork/level/path type terminology, so I feel less bad about skipping Shabbos on codecademy now.  

Title for this node is what I'm timeline cleansing with; so much accordion.
