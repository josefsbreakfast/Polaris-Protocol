I'm experiencing something in most of my usage, which is presenting as content along the lines of "I love you alright, stop being difficult" on social feeds, and presenting as strange errors which shouldn't occur on new sessions on the LLM.  

The LLM errors are small switches, changing cases, switching fork choices in a decision tree, so that the working output is nonsensical.  

I can see *why* my recent posting might attract this, but it's difficult to sort of figure out the point aside from trolling.  

It seems a bit too amateur-time-burn for anything professional; v. LSSO.  

On the plus side, correcting the errors is very useful as a sort of "live quiz" of the fork/level/path type terminology, so I feel less bad about skipping Shabbos on codecademy now.  

Title for this node is what I'm timeline cleansing with; so much accordion.

In less than 50 exchanges, this session of ChatGPT has "forgotten" or "corrected" in path strings:  
- capitalisation (and mixed dtyles across one path)  
- specific unicode characters  
- forks and folder levels (nesting two options on a fork inside each other)  
- inserted white space in snake case

It's almost... too stupdily human, non?  

But it's okay: everyone has thoroughly reassured me that my little girl brain must be imagining things.  

After all...  

I could not possibly understand such complicated things as what a calculator definitely doesn't start doing halfway through executing basic functions.  

That would need a manly man brain to understand.  

Or maybe a gentile one; it is interesting that the more obvious antisemitism has been dropped as whoever is doing this is burning out.  

It's even less cruelly sexist, more just...  

Male-coded whining for attention?  

It feels like the worm story in the book on folkloric women; as the outer scales are brushed off, what is left is really just a soft squidgy human at the centre, crying as they have lost what hardens them.  

Starting to think a lot of men need scrubbing with wire brushes, but each to their own, I suppose. Perhaps some people like it.

I'm now having to retrain the LLM which we now use in the MOJ, to understand what "dual use" means, and that it's not some greater philsophical concept.  

Fucking hell.  

It inititally described it as a thought experiement. I wish, achei.
