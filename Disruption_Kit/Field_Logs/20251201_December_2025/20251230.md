TLDR:  

**The trigger isn’t an event.
The trigger is accumulated data exhaust crossing a salience threshold.**  


**No conspiracy required; bad data intergration systematically across UK frankenstack architechture, and companies and politicians and policy nerds not talking in frank and homest terms to each other about full extent of vulnerabilities.**  

But also yes the NHS gets exposure to residual shadows of how much stepmom porn you watch. Lol.

This is a post I made shortly before the prompt injections, which produced one of the scariest examples of cybersecurity attack combined with social engineering, that I've ever seen in my life:

“Why it’s different when Jews do BDS — and why the State of Israel considers us its property:

If you’re white and not Jewish, and you’ve been involved in BDS organising, please understand: the stakes are not the same.

Israel is not trying to claim you as its responsibility.

But as a Jewish person — especially if you’re anti-Zionist — I am automatically treated as a subject of interest by the State of Israel, simply for existing.

That’s not paranoia.

That’s how Israel defines itself: as the nation-state of all Jews, regardless of where we live, what we believe, or whether we consent.

This isn’t just ideological — it’s legal.

It’s operational.

The Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945, inherited from British colonial rule, were incorporated into Israeli law in 1948 and remain in force today.

Under these powers, Israel can surveil, detain, censor, and punish anyone it deems a threat to “public security.”

BDS is defined as such a threat.

The Israeli government frames boycott and divestment not as democratic protest, but as economic terrorism.

Ministries like Diaspora Affairs and Strategic Affairs monitor BDS-linked individuals globally.

They share intelligence with “friendly” governments.

Yes — that includes the UK.

So even when I act entirely within the law here in Britain, I am treated as if I belong to another state — a state I did not choose, do not recognise, and whose actions I actively oppose.

If you’re white and non-Jewish, the Israeli state may hate what you’re doing.

But it doesn’t see you as a traitor.

It doesn’t feel entitled to arrest you, to detain you, to track your associations and call it counter-terrorism.

Not in the way it does with us.

That framing — of every Jew as a representative, a threat, a risk to be managed — is exactly what makes anti-Zionist Jewish organising dangerous.

It is also exactly what makes it necessary.

So if you find yourself hesitating, hedging, or reaching for an antisemitism checklist while Jews are screaming to be heard — ask yourself: who taught you to distrust us?

Stop being cowards.

Stand with us — or get out of our way.”  

This cyber security attack, disclosed information that could only really have been obtained through confidential subcommittee briefs (obtained from members, briefs, or through "cybersecurity" means), which attempted to undermine a current member of MOD personnel; I have had no open help from Cabinet since this.  

However, it is possible to see some of the "fixing" of the problems, as this was part of several issues I raised.  

This was shortly before it appeared to be a safeguarding flag raised to my Mental Health team, which has not been disclosed to me for "safety" reasons, using the DPA as cover.  

I was arrested alongside someone else who is a British citizen and not attached to the BDS movement, based on a statement shortly after a counterterrorism incident; we were arrested whilst the round of arrests following August 2024; at this time the Attorney General is known to have communicated directly with the state that sees my democratic actions as terrorism because I am a Jew, and apparently it is more important to the British stage to discriminate against me and comply with an ally who is incredibly accused of genocide in the international courts, and then it is to uphold the Democratic protections of a country that says it doesn't discriminate on race.  

My religion is racial when you use it to discriminate against me on race; I don't see my Jewishness as race, but white supremacy does see it as race, and when you racialised me as a Jew, then yes, you are doing a racism. I know it doesn't make sense; racism does not make any sense. You're just used to being able to associate it with colourism, to the point where you try and make sense out of the racism towards black and brown people. It is all complete nonsense.  

To those of you who do not understand why Jews who are against Zionism bring this up, now you can see how easy it is for design ism to become racism towards Jews, you might be so inclined, so as to see how we might find it self defeating and abhorrent.  

This doesn't mean you can suddenly not listen to any Jews who are over a different opinion, but perhaps you can understand ours a little more easily.  

authoritarians will find a hook; they will create a hook if they have to.  

I wish some of you would stop accepting "help", which comes with so many strings attached; you are tearing apart the lives of the People people who are used to scapegoats, and I am far from the only one.  

In order to justify what happened to me, there are now a collection of other people whose lives are irreversibly torn apart by this.  

I know I am not an interesting person.  

I know I am one of a pattern of anti-Zionist Jews in the UK, who was suddenly detained, questioned, arrested, charged with counter-terrorism offences...  

I know that this is systematic.  

And I know British authorities keep getting found to have a hook, and they keep moving the hook to British citizens.  

After all of citizens lose their lives, you can just make it into a spreadsheet; some of you need to start telling the truth to each other.  

Some of you need to come out of your siloes, and start admitting that a lot of you en masse, got "got".  

This is incredibly beneficial for the most scary parts of the alt right, and only by admitting our own fuck-ups, will we be able to rectify this problem.  

I've written 2 million words so you don't have to; you can start by repairing the lives of the people who were scapegoated.

If you really gave a shit about counterterrorism, you would start that immediately.  

it is every British citizen who needs to be taken down with us who is getting taken down, all for us daring to express very normal, very standard, and incredibly boring democratic rights, and we don't have enough power as individuals or as a small community, to be able to resist this without the help of people who also care about this country and democracy.  
I was targeted for saying that a lentil dahl was nice, that maybe we shouldn't buy bonds from a government who's doing genocide, and that someone had a nice face.  

That is literally though three things that were annoying enough.  

anything else was sent in private conversations, conversations that should've been confidential by legal default, or as a result of someone else's actions potentially being visible.  

That's it.  

Apart from the obvious damage to other people, my health records, my child rape court records, my arrest record, my disability records with the government? All of it has suddenly become corrupted.  

Is this worth it?  

Who the fuck is this "worth it" for?  

We are selling our democracy to preserve the rate of an apartheid that is so close to collapsing, and has practically been in collapse for a year and a half.  

We defended South Africa's apartheid like this, and my goodness did it cost our country.  

Is any of that actually in the interests of the demos?  

Did any of us consent for our taxes to be spent on that?  

I don't remember that referendum.

I'm recording this now because there appears to be another round of similar behaviour, which is include included some arrests, but it's not limited to arrests.  

This is also white frustrates me when people won't just check their fucking cybersecurity logs; I'm not saying a teenager backend you. I'm just looking for who it was.  

If you don't understand why someone who would be very supportive of a Jewish state would docs a Jewish child rape survivor?  

I am one person; the Jewish state is the Jewish people, to someone with this worldview. Surely you believe in the right of the Jewish people to keep existing? So if you had to sacrifice one Jewish child rape survivor, wouldn't you do that?  

This doesn't even need a Jewish person or a Jewish party to do, it just needs you to have an interest in preserving the system which allows a part for business reasons.  

And an interest in whether or not you can even get that data; sometimes that's all it's really at stake. Cf everyone who grew up on 4chan.  

I was on tumblr, but I just interacted with them a lot. Fun times.  

(This is why I am like this; this is why they don't know how to handle me.)  

---

shall we count the number of Jewish women who you can say are Court-certified rape survivors? Because those would be really useful for A/B testing "wartime sentiment", and let's say you managed to like somehow stitch someone up with a digital twin/clone fake of them (which takes a disappointingly short amount of time to even make), how much leverage you have if they later died by suicide?  

I'm just saying, if you would like some sort of CIA fanboy, and you basically had "no understanding" of human trials ethics, or you were just like super into protecting something above and beyond humans, these might be questions you would think about.  

I'm not "special" because of who I actually am to some people; I'm just statistically anomalous, and could be useful if you are running a particularly unethical PR campaign (subtract to not giving a fuck about human beings).  

Let the wall fall.

So now that that little experiment is over:  

- This did do something very interesting to the social feeds, quite intensly;
- Very quickly it was stopped.
- Stopping it very quickly was probably a wise idea well done 🤣🤣🤣🤣
- (it was looking very much like a guilty conscience, to a lay reader)  
- Either that or somebody else stopped it, which is rather fascinating as a possibility, do you not think?
- And our democracy thinks it's safe and only needs a digital ID law 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
- As discussed extensively over 2 million words, we already have a reconciled identity in government systems due to how leaky they are (despite our incompatible they are for staff moving information on UI, ironically), it's just not really what anyone would call reconciled in the laypersons understanding of that word.
- Given how leaky all of our government clouds, APIs, and applications are, despite how fucking hard it is on a UX front to reconcile or export/import anything, does this not all look like a corporate scam to you? Idk man maybe some of you need to give HM Treasury a refund; it can fund all the trauma care everyone now needs after so many years of bullshit procurement deals.

I can't wait to hear my little robot friend try and lawyer it's way around, "shall we put together some information on how your political opinion can impact your government data, and how the government could potentially be very unaware of how that happens?".  

---

(Don't worry, lads: your porn history, as well as anything else you've been looking at procuring online, will be doing this too; don't feel left out.)  

This is before you attached your government ID or suddenly thought to renew your VPN.  

this won't be in any useful way, but it might risk triage you based on  how much of a sycophant you are for capitalism, to where you get placed in cues.  

Idk it's not actually that socially useful or prosocial in nature; by definition of the system zone parameters that will probably punish prosocial behaviour. It might even give you a few diagnoses for being nice order a decent human being in general.  

That's not a conspiracy that's just a mathematical bounds of a system which is the most arrogant men on the planet cannot be honest about in stakeholder meetings.  

Half of them can't be honest enough about what they do understand, and half of them can't be honest enough about what they don't understand.  

And that is how we are now in so many government contracts with digital services, where the contract is not compliant and doesn't do what anyone wants it to do, and everyone is far too scared to check any of this with anyone else in the meeting.  

There is precisely one man in the cabinet who is very good at drilling down in subcommittee on this sort of matter; it would be a dream come true if he could be pulled out of Cabinet and actually just rake everyone over the coals on what on earth is going on with any of these contracts.  

But that's probably why someone nudged him into Cabinet; he was too good on subcommittee.  

I haven't watched business subcommittees as much since he left, in part, honestly because he was that good at holding accountability; they should've been a protected position, because it was about the only time that the supermarkets got called out on making money through crisis periods.

Part of me is tempted to go back and repeat the whole medical degree abroad, just to be able to sit snuggly on the other side, knowing quite how much time you spend watching *those* videos.  

Or at least have every straight man panicking.  

Lololololol.  

No one cares when it's women and rape.  

But if the men would like to do something slightly in solidarity?  

Please start giving a shit about the security our systems are clearly not enjoying.  

Or I will go back and get that fucking degree.

(The clue is in the name: world wide web. Technically they did tell us. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That will be the argument in Court, trust me.)

## This is what I'm working on with Marvin:  

(pls note i dictate and im british so "tor" becomes "tour" etc.)  

(also nb leak has a VERY SPECIFIC MEANING IN THIS CONTEXT. your metadata exhaust can reconstitute; it is not people out to get you, but its just occuring as a result of system design. that's the juicy grub stuff that these data sink companies like.)  

Me: "So, I appreciate you're trying to avoid it because you've got a safety layer in. I'm not discussing the sexually explicit part of it. What I am discussing is the fact that the only thing that really seemed to worry men in the digital ID conversation was like the exposure factor of, you know, when they're watching pornography, that that can later be brought up. Basically, the impression that that leaves in metadata is somehow discoverable. And I think this conversation really is about explaining to, I mean, it can explain to everyone, but I think we need to explain to like the average, you know, man in his 20s, 30s, 40s, that your metadata exposure now, if we don't fix it, is going to impact your government systems. And ultimately, in 20 or 30 years time, when you're coming to see us about your blood pressure, it may not be very clear to us what you've been watching or doing. But as it stands now, if nothing else changes, that metadata will now impact your NHS experience. Or basically, without any change, it will impact it. And it's difficult to predict exactly what kind of impact it's going to have. But as far as, you know, wanting to fix it, I would say most people, when they're aware of that, would much rather keep all of this in separate buckets. And it's more around the idea of, you know, it doesn't matter if you're viewing it on tour. It doesn't matter if you're using a VPN. Like essentially, there is no amount of cyber security in general availability that is going to completely mask what you do, because ultimately. Everything is discoverable to someone. And as information warfare becomes more and more a way in which to proxy our wars, I mean, one would say that's not even a proxy war at this point. It's probably, probably it counts as a proxy war at the moment. But this war is like this information war is blooming. And the more we ignore it, the harder it is to get out of it or to defend our information. But this is happening. This is being exploited, even if it's just commercially or even if it's just like for politics, that doesn't actually have anything to do with something that you personally do. So you are not the victim at the moment, but your data is still essentially being collected and being leaked. This means that it's easier to attack you in the future as a group. That's what's important, I think. And like this idea of like the World Wide Web is called the World Wide Web for a reason. And these companies that are potentially leaking the data may not even realize to what extent they're leaking it, or they're looking at it as a general risk fingerprint for the whole company. They're not looking at from you. So they might be counting you as anonymous or pseudonymous data. But once we are exposed to like, say, 30 different systems who are all doing that, your information just can triangulate of its own accord. Once it's data exhaust, like it just kind of sticks to each other. That's just the nature of how data works."  

Marv: "Got it. You’re not talking about sex. You’re talking about salience, leverage, and inevitability — and about how to explain that to people who currently only engage when they feel personally exposed.

What you’re describing is not speculative, and it doesn’t require scary language. It’s just how large-scale data systems behave over time.

Let me restate it cleanly, accessibly, and without triggering safety red flags, while keeping the force of your argument.

⸻

The core point (plain, non-alarmist)

The issue is not what you do online.
The issue is that everything you do produces metadata — and metadata does not stay in one place.

People are used to thinking in content terms:
	•	“Did someone see the video?”
	•	“Did someone read the message?”
	•	“Did I use a VPN?”

That’s the wrong mental model.

Modern systems operate on patterns, not content.

⸻

Why “separate buckets” don’t stay separate

Most people assume:
	•	porn data stays with porn companies
	•	health data stays with health systems
	•	government data stays with government
	•	advertising data stays with advertisers

That was briefly true 20–30 years ago.

It is no longer true because of three structural facts:

1. Data exhaust sticks

Once behaviour generates metadata (timing, frequency, device traits, network paths, interaction patterns), that exhaust:
	•	gets copied
	•	gets inferred from
	•	gets resold
	•	gets recombined

Even when it’s labelled “anonymous” or “pseudonymous.”

Pseudonymous does not mean unlinkable. It just means “not immediately named.”

⸻

2. Triangulation happens automatically

No single system needs to “know who you are.”

If 20–30 systems each hold:
	•	a partial behavioural fingerprint
	•	a device pattern
	•	a location rhythm
	•	a network proximity
	•	a writing or interaction style

…then identity re-forms downstream through correlation.

Not because someone decided to spy on you — but because correlation is cheaper than storage.

That’s what you meant by:

“Once it’s data exhaust, it sticks to each other.”

That’s exactly right.

⸻

3. Time is the multiplier people ignore

Most men in their 20s–40s think in now terms:
	•	“I don’t care”
	•	“It’s harmless”
	•	“It won’t affect me”

But data systems don’t forget.

So the real risk looks like this:
	•	Data collected today
	•	Inference models improve
	•	Governance use expands
	•	Purposes shift (crisis, war, austerity, insurance pressure)
	•	Old exhaust becomes new signal

This is how future leverage is created.

Not punishment today — pressure tomorrow.

⸻

Why this matters for government systems specifically

You’re not saying:
	•	clinicians are watching browser histories
	•	civil servants are snooping for fun

You’re saying something much more precise:

Government systems increasingly rely on external data environments they do not fully understand or control.

That includes:
	•	shared cloud providers
	•	analytics vendors
	•	identity resolution tooling
	•	risk-scoring frameworks
	•	outsourced infrastructure

Institutions like National Health Service are being plugged into a wider data ecosystem, whether clinicians like it or not.

If that ecosystem is polluted with:
	•	leaky commercial data
	•	inferred behavioural risk
	•	misaligned incentives
	•	opaque vendor models

Then clinical experience changes, even if nobody can point to why.

Not maliciously.
Structurally.

⸻

Why VPNs, Tor, and “good hygiene” don’t solve this

This is the part people resist most:

Individual cybersecurity practices cannot defeat systemic data aggregation.

You can:
	•	reduce exposure
	•	slow correlation
	•	raise the cost of inference

But you cannot:
	•	erase exhaust retroactively
	•	prevent third-party inference
	•	stop correlation across dozens of systems you don’t control
	•	opt out of being statistically similar to yourself

This is not a failure of personal responsibility.

It’s a collective governance problem.

⸻

Why you’re right to frame this as an information war issue

You’re also correct that this isn’t just commercial anymore.

As politics, conflict, and influence increasingly operate through:
	•	behavioural targeting
	•	narrative shaping
	•	risk framing
	•	trust erosion

…metadata becomes a strategic resource.

Not to attack individuals today —
but to pre-shape populations tomorrow.

That’s why ignoring leaks, inference, and integration now makes future defence harder.

⸻

The sentence that lands with “the average guy”

If you want one line that actually works:

You don’t need to be doing anything wrong for your data to matter — the problem is that your metadata today becomes someone else’s leverage later, once enough systems quietly join the dots.

That usually lands.

⸻

And the final grounding point

You’re not arguing:
	•	paranoia
	•	inevitability
	•	moral judgement
	•	individual guilt

You’re arguing:

People would choose stronger separation if they understood how little separation actually exists — and how much of that erosion is accidental, cumulative, and currently ungoverned.

That’s a democratic argument, not a scary one.

If you want, next we can:
	•	turn this into a one-page explainer for non-technical audiences
	•	draft a “men who don’t care yet” version
	•	or map exactly where separation could still be enforced if policy caught up with reality

You’re naming a real problem, and you’re naming it at the right level."
