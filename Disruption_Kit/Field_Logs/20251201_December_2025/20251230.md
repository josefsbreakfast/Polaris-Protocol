This is a post I made shortly before the prompt injections, which produced one of the scariest examples of cybersecurity attack combined with social engineering, that I've ever seen in my life:

“Why it’s different when Jews do BDS — and why the State of Israel considers us its property:

If you’re white and not Jewish, and you’ve been involved in BDS organising, please understand: the stakes are not the same.

Israel is not trying to claim you as its responsibility.

But as a Jewish person — especially if you’re anti-Zionist — I am automatically treated as a subject of interest by the State of Israel, simply for existing.

That’s not paranoia.

That’s how Israel defines itself: as the nation-state of all Jews, regardless of where we live, what we believe, or whether we consent.

This isn’t just ideological — it’s legal.

It’s operational.

The Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945, inherited from British colonial rule, were incorporated into Israeli law in 1948 and remain in force today.

Under these powers, Israel can surveil, detain, censor, and punish anyone it deems a threat to “public security.”

BDS is defined as such a threat.

The Israeli government frames boycott and divestment not as democratic protest, but as economic terrorism.

Ministries like Diaspora Affairs and Strategic Affairs monitor BDS-linked individuals globally.

They share intelligence with “friendly” governments.

Yes — that includes the UK.

So even when I act entirely within the law here in Britain, I am treated as if I belong to another state — a state I did not choose, do not recognise, and whose actions I actively oppose.

If you’re white and non-Jewish, the Israeli state may hate what you’re doing.

But it doesn’t see you as a traitor.

It doesn’t feel entitled to arrest you, to detain you, to track your associations and call it counter-terrorism.

Not in the way it does with us.

That framing — of every Jew as a representative, a threat, a risk to be managed — is exactly what makes anti-Zionist Jewish organising dangerous.

It is also exactly what makes it necessary.

So if you find yourself hesitating, hedging, or reaching for an antisemitism checklist while Jews are screaming to be heard — ask yourself: who taught you to distrust us?

Stop being cowards.

Stand with us — or get out of our way.”  

This cyber security attack, disclosed information that could only really have been obtained through confidential subcommittee briefs (obtained from members, briefs, or through "cybersecurity" means), which attempted to undermine a current member of MOD personnel; I have had no open help from Cabinet since this.  

However, it is possible to see some of the "fixing" of the problems, as this was part of several issues I raised.  

This was shortly before it appeared to be a safeguarding flag raised to my Mental Health team, which has not been disclosed to me for "safety" reasons, using the DPA as cover.  

I was arrested alongside someone else who is a British citizen and not attached to the BDS movement, based on a statement shortly after a counterterrorism incident; we were arrested whilst the round of arrests following August 2024; at this time the Attorney General is known to have communicated directly with the state that sees my democratic actions as terrorism because I am a Jew, and apparently it is more important to the British stage to discriminate against me and comply with an ally who is incredibly accused of genocide in the international courts, and then it is to uphold the Democratic protections of a country that says it doesn't discriminate on race.  

My religion is racial when you use it to discriminate against me on race; I don't see my Jewishness as race, but white supremacy does see it as race, and when you racialised me as a Jew, then yes, you are doing a racism. I know it doesn't make sense; racism does not make any sense. You're just used to being able to associate it with colourism, to the point where you try and make sense out of the racism towards black and brown people. It is all complete nonsense.  

To those of you who do not understand why Jews who are against Zionism bring this up, now you can see how easy it is for design ism to become racism towards Jews, you might be so inclined, so as to see how we might find it self defeating and abhorrent.  

This doesn't mean you can suddenly not listen to any Jews who are over a different opinion, but perhaps you can understand ours a little more easily.  

authoritarians will find a hook; they will create a hook if they have to.  

I wish some of you would stop accepting "help", which comes with so many strings attached; you are tearing apart the lives of the People people who are used to scapegoats, and I am far from the only one.  

In order to justify what happened to me, there are now a collection of other people whose lives are irreversibly torn apart by this.  

I know I am not an interesting person.  

I know I am one of a pattern of anti-Zionist Jews in the UK, who was suddenly detained, questioned, arrested, charged with counter-terrorism offences...  

I know that this is systematic.  

And I know British authorities keep getting found to have a hook, and they keep moving the hook to British citizens.  

After all of citizens lose their lives, you can just make it into a spreadsheet; some of you need to start telling the truth to each other.  

Some of you need to come out of your siloes, and start admitting that a lot of you en masse, got "got".  

This is incredibly beneficial for the most scary parts of the alt right, and only by admitting our own fuck-ups, will we be able to rectify this problem.  

I've written 2 million words so you don't have to; you can start by repairing the lives of the people who were scapegoated.

If you really gave a shit about counterterrorism, you would start that immediately.  

it is every British citizen who needs to be taken down with us who is getting taken down, all for us daring to express very normal, very standard, and incredibly boring democratic rights, and we don't have enough power as individuals or as a small community, to be able to resist this without the help of people who also care about this country and democracy.  
I was targeted for saying that a lentil dahl was nice, that maybe we shouldn't buy bonds from a government who's doing genocide, and that someone had a nice face.  

That is literally though three things that were annoying enough.  

anything else was sent in private conversations, conversations that should've been confidential by legal default, or as a result of someone else's actions potentially being visible.  

That's it.  

Apart from the obvious damage to other people, my health records, my child rape court records, my arrest record, my disability records with the government? All of it has suddenly become corrupted.  

Is this worth it?  

Who the fuck is this "worth it" for?  

We are selling our democracy to preserve the rate of an apartheid that is so close to collapsing, and has practically been in collapse for a year and a half.  

We defended South Africa's apartheid like this, and my goodness did it cost our country.  

Is any of that actually in the interests of the demos?  

Did any of us consent for our taxes to be spent on that?  

I don't remember that referendum.

I'm recording this now because there appears to be another round of similar behaviour, which is include included some arrests, but it's not limited to arrests.  

This is also white frustrates me when people won't just check their fucking cybersecurity logs; I'm not saying a teenager backend you. I'm just looking for who it was.  

If you don't understand why someone who would be very supportive of a Jewish state would docs a Jewish child rape survivor?  

I am one person; the Jewish state is the Jewish people, to someone with this worldview. Surely you believe in the right of the Jewish people to keep existing? So if you had to sacrifice one Jewish child rape survivor, wouldn't you do that?  

This doesn't even need a Jewish person or a Jewish party to do, it just needs you to have an interest in preserving the system which allows a part for business reasons.  

And an interest in whether or not you can even get that data; sometimes that's all it's really at stake. Cf everyone who grew up on 4chan.  

I was on tumblr, but I just interacted with them a lot. Fun times.  

(This is why I am like this; this is why they don't know how to handle me.)

shall we count the number of Jewish women who you can say are Court-certified rape survivors? Because those would be really useful for A/B testing "wartime sentiment", and let's say you managed to like somehow stitch someone up with a digital twin/clone fake of them (which takes a disappointingly short amount of time to even make), how much leverage you have if they later died by suicide?  

I'm just saying, if you would like some sort of CIA fanboy, and you basically had "no understanding" of human trials ethics, or you were just like super into protecting something above and beyond humans, these might be questions you would think about.  

I'm not "special" because of who I actually am to some people; I'm just statistically anomalous, and could be useful if you are running a particularly unethical PR campaign (subtract to not giving a fuck about human beings).  

Let the wall fall.

So now that that little experiment is over:  

- This did do something very interesting to the social feeds, quite intensly;
- Very quickly it was stopped.
- Stopping it very quickly was probably a wise idea well done 🤣🤣🤣🤣
- (it was looking very much like a guilty conscience, to a lay reader)  
- Either that or somebody else stopped it, which is rather fascinating as a possibility, do you not think?
- And our democracy thinks it's safe and only needs a digital ID law 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
- As discussed extensively over 2 million words, we already have a reconciled identity in government systems due to how leaky they are (despite our incompatible they are for staff moving information on UI, ironically), it's just not really what anyone would call reconciled in the laypersons understanding of that word.
- Given how leaky all of our government clouds, APIs, and applications are, despite how fucking hard it is on a UX front to reconcile or export/import anything, does this not all look like a corporate scam to you? Idk man maybe some of you need to give HM Treasury a refund; it can fund all the trauma care everyone now needs after so many years of bullshit procurement deals.
