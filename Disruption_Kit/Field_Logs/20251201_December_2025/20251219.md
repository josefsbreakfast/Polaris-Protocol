I should probably find it funny thst "the algorithm" (😏) trying to convince me to stop writing emails about information that is physically harming me in how much its been monumentally fucked with, that has cost me a medical degree, that has included weirdos with vibrating boxes in the flat downstairs, and which included jackhammering throught the pavement.  

Like surrrre...  

That's just a little tiff that I need to forget about.  

Rven more facinating is that a whole bunch of crawlers had to be dropped and cloners dropped to like a third of what they were before someone had to commit to something in writing. 🙃  

But it's cool.  

Clearly my squishly little girl brain is just making shit up again.
