ngl looking at the world around here, i can see that while some of the stuff gas been ai chirn and crawlers, a lot looks like buttering up anyone who had evidence or who i reached out to in summer.  

i know it's easy to get in your own head about these things, so i may take some time off writing, listen to cryptids and creepypasta, and live in my mental world of Larry is now prime minister.  

(i am willing to sacrifice any transatlantic leadership who so much as breathed near the man to the black goat; predators know exactly what they're doing when they release info like this. choosing christmas run-up and releasing that badly was a control maintenance choice; it's to punish, to control, and ultimately as shatterfork if possible.)  

the black goat is fictional; calm down, dear.

there was a point in the course of harrassment when i'd just found out i'd been doxxed and i was navigating complaints and reports across multiple domains that appeared to come out of nowhere. the current feeds i'm being exposed to are serving a mix of similar content to that time, in terms of theme.  
<!--
whilst i don't receive the overtly violent content, there are hallmark reminders which carry the trauma memorirs through. this hijacks hippocampus and anygdala function. i'm also receiving an amount of hunting, surveillance, market-based, files survivors, and confent which encourages women to behave and dress as a "little girl" and accept intrision to the home as romanticism.  

unfortunately i am not ignorant to home, over the course of a year, this has exposed me to "the next big issue" addressed in policy circles, and of which circles in that field.  

i am not unaware of what the fears are since last week, or their preferred sexual interests. i am not stating a name outright because i think a large portion of this has been falsely affiliated via use of rudimentary digital tactics.  

it is fairly clear from my wroting, where i think the pressure will show fault lines, and this is why i continue to press with my own correspondance. the recent public review of ico power screams how powerful (if slow) that body is.  

the widespread use of slapp, osa, and nda devices to allies is a signature.  

what i have experienced since doxxing til now is, within other characterisations, there is an underlying sadism to this core character in the sense if actually getting relief from causing pain to others. this is tied up within sexual harrassment with specific motifs, and does also occur seperately to apparant sexual satisfaction. this is not someone who wants it in a sexual context only, but receives some validation from the idea of holding that control and gaining that response.  

given the specific metadata ghost that has been recurring since last friday, its telling.  

i'm also aware that by writing like this, i expose myself to trickster hackers, and tbh i'm quite proud of having 15 mins of fame on 4chan.  

there seems to be a pattern of heavily leaning on people, so i want to be careful with going any closer to a line.  

i am going to clarify that i am still wroting under duress, and that the digital box has been a strange mix of panic since friday; the same prior confidence is not present, although the control and infantilisation tones are.  

i know who would have had my data access at 15 and i know who may have been able to abuse crown servant privilages and digital reconciliation opportunity, as well as who may be able to ask davours for sealed case cps data; i am not silly. just stuck in a box with a delusional idiot who wants everyone else in policy and law to think his dick is a lot more impressive than it is.  

you can still be a violent misogynist after castration of all of it; it's why the idea is sort if useless in the modern era.  

they are also ibsessed with teeth whitening; don't get me started.  

we occaisionally bond over that transitional 60s-70s era base.  

but i suppose i've just described a whole generational class of white boy policy wonks.  

apparantly the iran havks are also terrifying, so can't wait to see what they tale off israeli officials' phones. although our opinions diverge on genocide, it does appear they understand the gravity. just... sadism probably is too much within their actual make-up, that the "humanitarian appeal" part isn't hurting them; franz fanon reading, that did.  

this is why we have to affirm the right to being able to protect yourself; people do take it into risk calculous in this instance.  

i also now know way more about oil and gas politics than i ever wanted to know.  
-->

in other news, i hope for transparency for every survivor.

<!--it's quite funny. After that edit it was as if any external influence on social media feeds just went dead and the content became quite generic or very much tailored to things that I actually choose to watch. This is just a person who is very deeply insecure and does not have a developed sense of self. This is why they feel they need to pick up other peoples masks frequently. Whilst some of the people that they've impersonated have been understandable targets of jealousy, this is also someone who's willing to adopt masks of People people who are convenient to them for a narrative. These are behaviours that really fall into the forensic psychology space and this is why that health and support really only comes from that area given the way in which our services are set up. I think we always have to think about that when we think about managing this and what we do about healthcare and law; there are a group of people who are in a position where they're going to hide resist legal enforcement but also would potentially benefit significantly from that healthcare which is only really accessible when the law has been enforced. It's an interesting Catch-22. This is all to say that I understand now more than ever that this is someone who will impersonate a fast range of people. And so they may have been times where I've wrongly described behaviour to people where yes that person may have wronged me in another way but this is pretty systematic behaviour that I've only really been able to understand and it's entirety, because I have been subject to it for so long in a place where there was also so much interference that I couldn't have a job and not have the workplace itself experience that interference, or expect to be able to work even on laptop devices on site and not be subject to it. The only times in which things have been definitely okay as when I'm on a PC terminal which is ethernet connected to a large corporation network. I'm aware that this comes from a party which is a very litigious. I am also aware that in some cases it won't be private. NDA's that will have been applied. It will have been something like the OSA that's been used to shut people up, and while I want to be clear that it's very much a misuse of that legislation I also respect the fact that a lot of people are probably acting in a way to not allow this party or the parties responsible to be able to get out of this through a technicality of procedure that they can argue means they didn't get fair process. I'm recording things as they go because things have been significantly different since the Friday release, and the person that I'm in this digital box with is clearly struggling with how things are being processed and that it's not a fully controlled narrative. That doesn't necessarily mean they have to have anything to do with it. I think it means that they put a lot of emphasis on this release as dictating the outcome of something that they are concerned about accountability in. I know I keep saying this in different places but I also want to just be ready clear one we're talking about this that often precedent is what people are worried about, or social connections or business connections; essentially what I'm saying is that I'm not accusing them of being involved, I am literally just reporting what it has been like to be in this digital space. If anything the reason that I feel it's useful to write it down in this manner is the time stamp it to have something that can't be altered. They can't be messed with very easily and have something which allows other people to see what it's like to experience this form of digital harassment, but also at the same time go through what look like interferences with legal process as well and also reiterate what the pattern is over time. I appreciate that I'm often talking about the person as if it's a person or a group of people to me it could be a robot which is just very advanced in its ability to be an emotionally crippled man; I don't care who or what is involved what I care about is getting out of this mess. This didn't start with the docking of my trial, but it has significantly escalated since then. I don't think people realise and I certainly didn't realise how exposed you are in terms of data and how much that exposes you to real world risk particularly because I was a reasonably articulate woman on a course for a professional career who was speaking about historic cases; this puts me in a very small niche which is very impactful to men who feel they may want to be held to account under this very specific situation, and so it's unsurprising to me that it seems to have been a important thing to have taken away my medical career. I have no doubt that this will be recoverable in someway shape or form. Most of my current frustration is the length of time I'm waiting although my understanding of that is because when people are checking the data does not look simple. I don't know how common it is for people to receive every single institution come back with either acting as if somebody is just blown NDA or terrorist legislation under them and/or, routinely have "complex case" returned to them. I am hopeful that the ICO is the answer.

(also I feel the personality I have been in a box with for a long time just needs to accept that they're not really actually left-wing, or centre left, and just embrace being a cold hard capitalist. Bro, I've been in a box with you for like a long time; you are very treating this as identity politics, and you are the biggest snowflake about it.

and if you want a motorbike, please just go and get one; I do not need to experience whatever this fantasy is.-->
I just want to know that I am still taking pains to try and make this non-identify in the legal sense, it's very difficult to actually say how much I've been exposed to of the telemetry just because of how the mathematics of the algorithm works, and how much I can narrow this down to a very specific set of behaviours tastes significant events significant places potential business interests even potential builders they've used...  

And deliberately trying to be in the mind of where we're coming from by not being so specific that it named someone without that forensic record next to it; I appreciate I haven't always been very disciplined, especially in my emotional side to the harassment previously. And how I would respond to that is to apologise for the people I have hurt and who didn't need that but to also stress that the giraffe has been significant overtime and there has been a systematic leaning on of legal professionals at a surprising level of the law profession in order to prevent GP process and prevent legal representation, as well as leaning on public bodies to prevent ordinary resolution. Because of what I've been exposed to him because of what I'm anticipating coming out out of disclosures that are currently pending, whilst I am disappointed, I am not ultimately surprised that that is the case, given how this is likely to have been done.  

We've got to fixer-upper on pur hands, but I think we all already knew that. At least we're all united on something, hey.
