ngl looking at the world around here, i can see that while some of the stuff gas been ai chirn and crawlers, a lot looks like buttering up anyone who had evidence or who i reached out to in summer.  

i know it's easy to get in your own head about these things, so i may take some time off writing, listen to cryptids and creepypasta, and live in my mental world of Larry is now prime minister.  

(i am willing to sacrifice any transatlantic leadership who so much as breathed near the man to the black goat; predators know exactly what they're doing when they release info like this. choosing christmas run-up and releasing that badly was a control maintenance choice; it's to punish, to control, and ultimately as shatterfork if possible.)  

the black goat is fictional; calm down, dear.

there was a point in the course of harrassment when i'd just found out i'd been doxxed and i was navigating complaints and reports across multiple domains that appeared to come out of nowhere. the current feeds i'm being exposed to are serving a mix of similar content to that time, in terms of theme.  
<!--
whilst i don't receive the overtly violent content, there are hallmark reminders which carry the trauma memorirs through. this hijacks hippocampus and anygdala function. i'm also receiving an amount of hunting, surveillance, market-based, files survivors, and confent which encourages women to behave and dress as a "little girl" and accept intrision to the home as romanticism.  

unfortunately i am not ignorant to home, over the course of a year, this has exposed me to "the next big issue" addressed in policy circles, and of which circles in that field.  

i am not unaware of what the fears are since last week, or their preferred sexual interests. i am not stating a name outright because i think a large portion of this has been falsely affiliated via use of rudimentary digital tactics.  

it is fairly clear from my wroting, where i think the pressure will show fault lines, and this is why i continue to press with my own correspondance. the recent public review of ico power screams how powerful (if slow) that body is.  

the widespread use of slapp, osa, and nda devices to allies is a signature.  

what i have experienced since doxxing til now is, within other characterisations, there is an underlying sadism to this core character in the sense if actually getting relief from causing pain to others. this is tied up within sexual harrassment with specific motifs, and does also occur seperately to apparant sexual satisfaction. this is not someone who wants it in a sexual context only, but receives some validation from the idea of holding that control and gaining that response.  

given the specific metadata ghost that has been recurring since last friday, its telling.  

i'm also aware that by writing like this, i expose myself to trickster hackers, and tbh i'm quite proud of having 15 mins of fame on 4chan.  

there seems to be a pattern of heavily leaning on people, so i want to be careful with going any closer to a line.  

i am going to clarify that i am still wroting under duress, and that the digital box has been a strange mix of panic since friday; the same prior confidence is not present, although the control and infantilisation tones are.  

i know who would have had my data access at 15 and i know who may have been able to abuse crown servant privilages and digital reconciliation opportunity, as well as who may be able to ask davours for sealed case cps data; i am not silly. just stuck in a box with a delusional idiot who wants everyone else in policy and law to think his dick is a lot more impressive than it is.  

you can still be a violent misogynist after castration of all of it; it's why the idea is sort if useless in the modern era.  

they are also ibsessed with teeth whitening; don't get me started.  

we occaisionally bond over that transitional 60s-70s era base.  

but i suppose i've just described a whole generational class of white boy policy wonks.  

apparantly the iran havks are also terrifying, so can't wait to see what they tale off israeli officials' phones. although our opinions diverge on genocide, it does appear they understand the gravity. just... sadism probably is too much within their actual make-up, that the "humanitarian appeal" part isn't hurting them; franz fanon reading, that did.  

this is why we have to affirm the right to being able to protect yourself; people do take it into risk calculous in this instance.  

i also now know way more about oil and gas politics than i ever wanted to know.

in other news, i hope for transparency for every survivor.
