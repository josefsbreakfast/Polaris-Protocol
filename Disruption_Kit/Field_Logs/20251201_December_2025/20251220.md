I believe in better.  

I'm not saying this from a place where I feel strong, and I'm saying this fairly close to tears, which I'm going to be honest - this is actually quite physiologically difficult for me to do (meds). I say that to emphasise the strength of emotion, and to emphasise the place that feels like we weakness that this is coming from.  

But I do believe in better.  

I often find it very difficult to get through the December season, and I know that that's very similar for a lot of other people.  

It's really such a shame that you can have as few as one person in your life really hurt you, and sometimes that is enough to make an awful lot of everything else very difficult.  

It's not that I don't have gratitude for what I do have.  

It's that my load is quite hard to carry, and that I'm tired.  

Everyone gets tired.  

In my life, sometimes I have felt too tired, to be able to carry it further.  

Which is why I often choose very actively and very deliberately to believe in better.  

It's not that I particularly want to.  

It's not that I particularly feel like it.  

However: "if I am not for myself, who will be for me?"  

So I choose, sometimes quite resentfully, to believe in better.  

And I hope that however amazing or however shit your December season is going, that you might be able to access that belief in something better too.

In other news?  

I now have three controllers who are convincingly in breach of the DPA and respect to answering their SARs, and it actually excludes any law-enforcement who have used generic exemptions, and excludes the breach of FOI with a different controller. This excludes the Ministry of Justice, as I'm waiting for a return that I'm hoping is with the right person now.  

All of these have been like pulling teeth, and it's really such a shame that I'm still getting stonewalled.  

For all of these institutions or organisations, I have answers which cannot meaningfully make sense in the information they presented, and the work that they do, and the function that data serves within their environment.  

There are two potential outcomes:  

Either the entire country is now so behind and so lacking on transparency, that they are fundamentally unable to answer to the law, or alternatively, something has gone very very wrong with my data.  

It has gone very very wrong since 2016, worsened in 2018, worsened in 2020, and worsened again in 2022, and since then progressively worse every year since.  

There are likely to be some systemic factors, but obviously it's quite difficult when there's this much damage, and this much irregularity, to not think that at least should've been some prevention of negligence, if not some audit of the record at least in the bigger organisations.  

I'm embodying this sort of mixture of being absolutely terrified of the full extent, whilst also being desperate for that relief to finally know, and just get it over and done with; paradoxically if I can ascertain the full story, it actually puts me in a better stead to access appropriate safeguarding for the level of damage.  

So the whole thing feels very weird.  

I also think it's very likely that the staff you are answering me genuinely do not know about the full extent of what has happened, and I'll probably getting told to manage and contain it more locally.  

I think this is really dangerous and such a shame when once we put your name to a record anywhere, you are signing off legal documentation, and it essentially becomes something you have to prove at a later stage if it's ever brought up in Court.  

And then I'm going to remind everyone that I've already stood and glared at my father in Court; I am quite capable of going up on a witness stand and saying what happened.  

I am quite capable of going up on a witness stand and same things that I wish I'd never had to come out of my mouth before, because that's a somewhat rigid sense of justice that I have, when under Oath.  

Tzedek, tzedek: tzdorf!

In addition, the algorithmic placement is now obviously so poisoned by previous attempts to frame someone and  impersonate them, but as we have previously discussed to using very racist tropes that do not match this person's ethnicity, or this is still ongoing, that my social feeds are essentially acting like the worst catfish attempt in the world.  

I don't mind it when it actually reflects back what it looks like a human beings taste who is somewhat close in data terms. This is far more pleasant.  

It's the rest of it that is comical.  

Because what it seems to be doing is picking up on proxies for a motive behaviour (this is how the TikTok algorithm seems so "good" at reading people), and effectively reflecting them back.  

If at some point, they were a party of data brokers, or reputation management services, involved?  

They have created that data link themselves, and the machine is just being a machine by picking up their behavioural proxy data, and turning that into data at my end, whilst assuming that we are in a close enough relationship that it statistically matches it for, "how he's feeling".  

This is robustly hilarious.  

It's almost as good as that leaky penis email.  

Sometimes when I feel really down at the moment, I just remember that someone did that to themselves, and they're having to live with it three years on.  

And that somehow makes life more tolerable.

What I also love about some of the adverts that I keep getting in the last few weeks, is that it's really indicative of who's picking up the script now.  

We are at the reduced section of the bargain bin.  

It is glorious.  

The fact that money has been pulled this extensively, and that goes with the crawlers as well, is a very particular sign.  

It's a sign that I am going to win, and it won't take that much longer to get over the finish line.  

Thank goodness, because I need to sit in a very hot slightly humid room, and be beaten half to death with branches.  

And then roll in the snow like a husky.  

(Look those of you who seen me in person know how transparent I am; having the same innate needs as a Siberian dog, not that surprising.)

Less than 20 hours of this DOJ release and I can see *exactly* why so many people would really prefer I wasn't alive enough to be verbal and responsive.

Oh, it makes sense now why we've been so nice to me on the feed recently. It makes sense why I've been buttered up.  

I don't think any of you understand surviving: I am perfectly rational at the same time, but I am absolutely livid, that we  still live in the world where any of this happens at this scale at this level and you have the audacity to lecture anyone else about morality.  

I mean, keep buttering me up. It is slowing me down...  

We all know I write more when I'm angry. ☺️
