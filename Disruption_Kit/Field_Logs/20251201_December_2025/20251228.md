im going to lead by pointing out that thos change could be completely coincidental.  

there are also lots of boring explanatioms.  

but my headcanon to amuse myself / for the plot, is that the remaining crawlers may have hust been pulled bc the west's premier data mining company has a fragile corporate ego.  

its not the gov; they know they're a bunch of ents.
