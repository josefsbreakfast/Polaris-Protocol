(let me have the v silly plotline pls:)  

im going to lead by pointing out that thos change could be completely coincidental.  

there are also lots of boring explanatioms.  

but my headcanon to amuse myself / for the plot, is that the remaining crawlers may have hust been pulled bc the west's premier data mining company has a fragile corporate ego.  

its not the gov; they know they're a bunch of ents.  

(it would be funny tho; i feel like there's a satire node here but my brain isn't there yet.)  

(i also used to get targeted job ads all the time for this co., at the height of my words being chopped up into algorithmic policy mush, and suppressed as mathmatical results. i'm aware of how silencing the contracts around this procurement are, so i'm not pushing intent or blame. it's just so opaque that it's hard to say, "yeah nah chance is zero", and i think that's most of the transparency world's issue with it.)
