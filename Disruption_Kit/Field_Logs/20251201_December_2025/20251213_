recognising that:  

- many new nodes from nov 2025 contain incorrect first create date, and with plan for audit and correct;  
- the hilarious nudges and prompts around current drafting of alt-righ infiltration and erosion of oversight via policing (it's... obvious enough to be slapstick, seriously);  
- filing this field logs folder will tak more than a minute, but the analysis of previous genAI nodes has been interesting, and i'm not allowing it any particular weighting but just reporting conversation as is;  

i am having a fairly interesting time with my pandora's box of "and why the fuck are details of my witness testimony in a csa case public, mfers".  

No, really, I actually am.  

I love it when men who don't usually face accountability fuck up.  

You can taste the fear in the air and it is delicious.  

Also I've got fanedits of The Expanse on loop, so I am truly living my best life.
