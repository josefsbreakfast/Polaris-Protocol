i have resisted discussing this previously, because it is fairly unusual behaviour.  

it would make what was likely a product of questioning, extremely darvo.  

there are several core reasons why i'm not toyching it yet.  


but if you have been informed about my case in 2018/9, and you're upset a supervisor wouldn't accept you, and that's the rationale for clanging around in data?  

- for how much you sold your skills, they are blunt, and not slick;
- i understand the mechanism but seriously this is way too far;
- this is not what that knowledge is for.

*take it if it resonates.*  

if you don't understand something, sometimes that just means you haven't explored it, or it's not for you; it doesnt have to be a condemnation of others.

probably worth pointing out that i was fairly open and ready to laugh at myself, and tbh the reason i didn't always tell my entire life to others, even if we soent a lot of time together, is sometimes because i just didn't see it as necessary of relevant at any point.  

it's not shame, although i do notice myself that there are people i never seem to telk core facts to, just because i know that might be a bit too much for them. it's bot really a trust thing as much as it is overloading them as the person they are and in the frame of mind they're in.
