i have resisted discussing this previously, because it is fairly unusual behaviour.  

it would make what was likely a product of questioning, extremely darvo.  

there are several core reasons why i'm not toyching it yet.  


but if you have been informed about my case in 2018/9, and you're upset a supervisor wouldn't accept you, and that's the rationale for clanging around in data?  

- for how much you sold your skills, they are blunt, and not slick;
- i understand the mechanism but seriously this is way too far;
- this is not what that knowledge is for.

*take it if it resonates.*  

if you don't understand something, sometimes that just means you haven't explored it, or it's not for you; it doesnt have to be a condemnation of others.
