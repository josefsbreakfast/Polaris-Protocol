also going through the "show her all the symbols/ads/vids about locking life-threatening aggression on the other side of the door" again, but not as strongly as when this was prevelent (approx 9 months prior at peak).  

awesome sauce.  

also being algorithmically placed for aliyah-adjacent content and palestine action coverage.  

go figure.  

i cannot possibly imagine who would be finding this cluster of topics to be of interest.  

(they've gone for, "only choose songs from pakistan idol", so gold star for attempts at cultural sensitivity; there is an attempt to not flatten all of south asia into one. baby steps.)
