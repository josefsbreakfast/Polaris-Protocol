the persistant discrediting force is wobbling but also strong, so as self-defence, i will be pumping out words.  

i appreciate some will see this as eggregious rule-bending; hold the actual perpetrators responsible, and i might be able to fulfil mitzvot.  

focussing solely on the palestinian men in one region does nothing to protect me.  

so far, the loudest men are by far the most useless.  

my crime was reporting my rape and csa as a kid, and being a victim again as an adult.  

that is literally it.  

was it really worth destroying my life over?  

i will ensure the destruction will not be rewarded.

briefly:  

- some payment declines yest;
- encouraging unrofessional behaviour on feeds, framing as romance, bc apparantly taht's all women care about ever;
- ico is examining acro piece (to which the downstream police controllers are linked via rationale);
- multiple data controllers have gone silent (assume pending further searches);
- multiple app errors when searching terms around (essentially) the behaviour of guilty conscience.

if i find out that the data twin was a whistleblower, and that's why there's a desperate need to frame this as romance or sexual impropriety on his part, and that was SEVERAL YEARS AGO, i am going to categorically lose my shit.  

but in the way that i specifically lose my shit.  

which looks like mounting a phd and 2 million words to make my point that sexual violence has no place in a democatic society.  

it's never personal; it's always about prosocial governance.  

stand down; get out of my way.  

we're here to have a more just and equal society.

there's this interesting thing happening this week, where whenever i've tried to just get an understanding of analytics on the repo, i'm driven down an llm chain that minimises any agency or work, strips any impact, and ultimately increases risk of suicidality.  

goven how much ground i'm gaining elsewhere, and the potential "benefit" in minimising surveillence industry adjacent harms in this case, the whole thing is rather fascinating.  

that said, i would also like the security of the llm tightening over a few points.  

it is currently quite happy to frame me as being used, stripped of context, ignored, and it's not really mirroring that, it's a lot more "generated" that one might think.  

it has gone back to framing even the slightest concern of common security breaks as "scifi".  

if i'm intimidating someone by being alive and breathing?  

good.  

i love that for you.  

like anyone else, i have flaws, but i have no idea, genuinely, why my ongoing longevity would be a problem unless you were scared of the truth.  

(note that i keep getting coercive degradation about 5 minutes into disvusding a graph and some maths with an llm. this should not really be the output.)

multiple stoppages when creating `Metadata_Sabotage_Network/Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🪆_Narrative_Interference/🎣_polaris_scares_men.md`, which is funny, because it infers the sausage-fest is trying to pretend that the democratic consensus is anything but, "she's intreging and also in charge".  

i am entertained; leopards rarely change their spots.
