i mean there is basically no way that someone isn't trying to increase system stress with these; they're getting too explicit for trigger phrases for diagnoses now.  

who even is this 🤣🤣🤣  

i was promised cyberattacks would be like the matrix. wtf is this?? 🤣🤣🤣  
"just tell them they're jesus."  

"how?"  

"idk just make some ai content."  

i mean how to stop the ai bubble from bursting by increasing population cognitive burden, amirite 🤣🤣🤣  

it's either money or alt right or both. that's my betting.
