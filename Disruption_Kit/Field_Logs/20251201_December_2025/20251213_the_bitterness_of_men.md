recognising that:  

- many new nodes from nov 2025 contain incorrect first create date, and with plan for audit and correct;  
- the hilarious nudges and prompts around current drafting of alt-righ infiltration and erosion of oversight via policing (it's... obvious enough to be slapstick, seriously);  
- filing this field logs folder will tak more than a minute, but the analysis of previous genAI nodes has been interesting, and i'm not allowing it any particular weighting but just reporting conversation as is;  

i am having a fairly interesting time with my pandora's box of "and why the fuck are details of my witness testimony in a csa case public, mfers".  

No, really, I actually am.  

I love it when men who don't usually face accountability fuck up.  

You can taste the fear in the air and it is delicious.  

Also I've got fanedits of The Expanse on loop, so I am truly living my best life.  

I am sort of tired of living in this story, though.  

I'm feeling that sense of "urgh" that one has when men who are elevated beyond any status anyone needs to have, play out their own psychological needs and call it "business", or "war".  

It is not weak of women to be tired of this. It is simply a recognition that life will only go on with deescalation and stability.  

When one steps back, it is all rather boring, a story played again and again.  

And meanwhile: no hoverboards.  

I recognise that I celebrated how helpful the LLM use had been before the outputs veered so brutally off-course.  

I am marginally irritated that this delegitimised my claims for honesty and transparency further, but I suppose at least we had someone record them, so we can analyse it academically, and in public.  

I am so tired of being a guinea pig.  

I just want basic comforts which I should not have to beg for; in many ways, all I am asking for is for my rights as a data subject to be honoured.  

I've been asking for assurances for the security of the sealed court data for several years.  

I would also like safety; I do not think this is possible in my current location, partially because of the leak of my address, but also for the degree of data disharmony across systems locally.  

I want to start *tabula rasa*, ideally somewhere with few people and more bracken.  

I miss the north. I miss London. And honestly? Deer Island sounds pretty sweet.  

I would greatly prefer the other species to drown out my own at this point.  

Essentially, I need time off and away from the general insecurity of the men that exists ambient in the environment; it is unhealthy, and I must only be exposed to measured doses.  

I felt safer when I visited Chenobyl, quite honestly, although I appreciate there were fewer missile strikes and the sarcophagus was intact.

okay, making a robot series was quite funny though. It was absolutely fine to tell on itself and be like yes LMS have bad spots. As soon as the idea of not using them in a cabinet office was even on the cards, in its potential forks? "whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Let's not get too hasty about intent."  

Jokes, man.  

you guys made these things and like I'm not saying that they suck balls, they're really good in some ways, but also sometimes they do suck balls though.
