 I'm just noting for a point of going forward that I'm in the process of going back through a lot of data from the time that I experienced one of the worst parts of the harassment, and how I was desperately trying to work out what was happening, and how much I put other people at risk by not keeping good operational security.  

 I'm also hideously embarrassed, because of the content of some of it; I absolutely dread the idea that other humans have read this.  

 I stand by the emotions that I was having and I standby being as afraid as I was, and trying my best under duress, to make sense of it to protect other people emotionally and to protect other people physically. I don't believe that I did protect people very well. I look back on it now and I read it and I feel intensely angry at myself.  

 I feel a huge sense of grief for what I've put people through, but also very grateful that they were human humans around me that hard enough to intervene and recognise that there was something very wrong.  

 I'm meeting that point where I know I can't collapse the narrative into something very simple that went wrong, and I know I can't make it entirely a systems problem; neither of these fit with some of the events, validated by other humans, that occurred.  

 I still don't really feel safe because I don't really have a good explanation and I'm being actively stonewalled; I understand there is a strong hesitation in offering even the slightest bit of information, but I've also lived for several years not knowing why really very personal details of something very intimate and very harmful that happened to me, have ended up being so widespread across the public domain.  

 I think I have the most likely theoretical target in my head for the motivations might have been of anyone involved, and I also believe a lot of it was just a lot of people being very tired very stressed and responding the best they could in the situation they were in; a really difficult thing about harm that I learned very early in life is that sometimes the adults in the room were really trying their best, and sometimes that doesn't stop terrible things from happening.  

 You can tell I'm having a bit of a Mental Health moment around this because of the number of sentences that start in the first person; this is not my default setting.  

 Every day I wait for clarity is just another day where I'm torturing myself, and it's really difficult to see how I can stop doing it, because I was already well beyond capacity before any of this started.  

 This may be that the somewhat dry and caustic humour may increase, until at least one institution owns up to having made some degree of error, or having some degree of date of vulnerability.  

 There's also just part of me that is so angry at having to listen to several years of my "classification"of human being, being weaponised by People who had absolutely no business to be talking about anything to do with my experience of life. That narrative is now been so overused as a justification for such trophy that even when I'm trying to get even the slightest bit of movement on what should be an administrative issue, I'm treated like I'm making it up.  

 So thanks to the Medinat; you already scored an own goal, there.  

 I don't want to have to justify why I don't support that legal entity mass wandering as a functional state ever again.  

 One would think that everything else would've been the worst, but the degree of degradation that I'm going through just to get answers, when we all know that this would've been an inherent risk when putting that narrative across to the general public?  

 I never want anyone to tell me that they are the expertise in this. And I never want to hear white goyim use the default positions as a reference to the expertise of who understands what living in the diaspora is like.  

 Anyway.  

 Happy Hannukah. Chag Sameach. Free Palestine.
