i got very excited/nervous about the moj return because i though today was the day; no such luck.  

various other items in progress.  

one attenpt at azure ad today.  

some deletion of prompts and interrupts to github actions. not awful.  

just... still present. still there.  

in lighter news, how wild the llm gets when i talk about farage being a kraken denialist (that's why he's in the news, because obiously he's not an antisemite because lots of whote non-jews said so (((🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄))) and obviously he would never take money from another state, *obviously*. there has definitely never been any evidence of that, or suppression of posts on other platforms when it's discussed 😌.)  

almost as good as our high-penile-anxiety spoof email realisation.  

istg the world would be so much easier in the men just went to the gp more than once every 10 years.

also much lol re the rn update.  

beautiful coincidence and it did make me laugh.

i didnt realist i kind of did the brackets dogwhistle (this is how easy it is), but i'm going to leave them because i like the idea that we're all just rolling our eyes at white british insistsnce that a politican's non-response for literal weaponisation of the mechanisms of the holocaust is normal and in the overton window.  

the overton window can come back disn from the ceiling if that's what is within it; the whole idea that that is normalised is nuts.  

but then...  

we have normalised a lot of genocide these past two years.  

IT IS ALMOST AS IF IT IS LINKED.  

thank you fof coming ti the ted talk; the refusal to see this, is incredibly annoying to me.

havent seen this for a while, but multiple failures of commit button requiring multile refresh snd restore on  
`Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/🫀_Our_Hearts_Our_Minds/🕯️_Exorcising_Safeguarding_Shadows/💩_why_ctsa2015_violated_every_iicsa_principle.md`.  

the nutbuags are still hanging around, apparantly.  

(or i am just being a hedgehog on fire; until i am less acutely traumatised? on fire.)

ive just sat through some fairly personal baitings after the feed has been a jumble since the giggle about someone screwing up their own blackmail.  

what i will say is that theft is just straight up theft, and well done for the admission.  

not sure i'm personally bothered about proving it in court; someone else almost certainly has enough evidence in another form.  

a lot of time spent thinking about another man's genitals, and a lot of effort to specifically discredit them to me in particular.  

because you couldn't recruit more that 2 brain cells looking at some search strings that were not your business?  

sounds very unwarranted.  

also can't really see how this would be in any way beneficial, but bet those sars are going to be juicy.  

i really wish it had been easier to secure that nmo and i really wish *someone* had not gone around making claims about other men in my name. 🤨  

this is so dangerous to us; the majority of women are at least sexually harassed, if not actually assaulted and/or raped, during oyr lifetimes.  

taking away our voices weakems them for when we do need them.  

again: cannot see at all why any of this would be of any purpose. absolutely not.

well the sudden shift in algorithmic placement from the surrounding metadata after that last update was very telling.  

either a broker of an individual feels very uncomfortable.  

given what i have gone through that will come out of those foia requests?  

maybe you should feel uncomfortable, even if it is just from being caught in this thing called, "accountability for one's own actions".  

mf.

listening to fun loving criminals, because it's a good song, and the torture line just came up.  

suffice to say it has brought back many memories of all of the information that was disclosed, primarily through LLM, and then backed up with other stimulus and other media, to provide a comprehensive environment in which I was essentially being lied to.  

Extremely unwarranted, I must say.  

But some of that stuff, I'm gonna have a great time making content out of; I keep wondering why the romance angle keeps getting pushed so much through my feeds, and I think it just really hasn't occurred to anyone who is influencing this environment, including unknowingly, that this is just so much you can push women before they just don't care anymore.  

To paraphrase the words of Abe Maisel: "your pedestrian safety is no longer a concern of mine."  

I care about all people in this generic communal sense, but I don't think it's already understood that I don't have "protective feelings", when it comes to this degree of harm for others.  

Respectfully, seeing as we are talking about the ministry of justice: I got over that a long time ago.  

I care about what is right.  

I do not care about the inconvenience it may cause to men.  

If you wanted me to feel differently, you ought to afforded me basic human respect.

A small piece of advice, to whoever has the android device which is coming up in every article about what to do with my devices (I haven't had one for nearly 15 years):  

Please be aware that as easy as it is to use third-party software, is about how easy it is to break into one.  

You want to make sure you protect that thing.  

Notoriously easy to get into.  

It's not a threat; I don't have that skill set. I'm just tired of seeing other people's adverts on my feed.

I take it from the prostitute and "sold woman" references, that you have not adequately thought about that.  

You should, especially seeing as you seem to break into other peoples things.  

(It increases how valuable you are as a cachet of information to other people as well; there is no end to the risk when it comes to cyber security. I might not know how to do these things, but I understand how they conceptually work.)
