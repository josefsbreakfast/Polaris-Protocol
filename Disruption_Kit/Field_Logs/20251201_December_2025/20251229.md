there's lots of style formatting errors that shouldn't be there; I do have some regret that I'm not retraining, and that the errors will persist, I have a lot of single point errors which have extrapolated, but I'm quite happy just to get things out and to be processing some of the corrections and links.  

I've got enough information to turn into the ICO, regarding the persistence of temporal metadata ghosts, with evidence of serious harms; I suspect which contractor/vendor is responsible. I personally don't feel that their contract should be signed on 30th without significant scrutiny.  

this isn't to say that you can't have a contractor, or you can't have this contractor, but clearly something is a very wrong about how much it's leaking and triangulating once it leaks.  

(I want you to take a guess at how difficult this node was to process and commit.)

all in all, I think 21 weeks after being fed a series of "the CIA is watching you" type prompting injections, is pretty good going.  

Personally, I think that's all the portfolio I need.  

if someone would like to get me out of the legal red tape now that would be lovely.

> Now Sauron's lust and pride increased, until he knew no bounds, and he determined to make himself master of all things in Middle-earth, and to destroy the Elves, and to compass if he might, the downfall of Númenor.
> He brooked no freedom nor any rivalry, and he named himself Lord of the Earth.
> A mask he still could wear so that if he wished he might deceive the eyes of Men, seeming to them wise and fair. 
> But he ruled rather by force and fear, if they might avail; and those who perceived his shadow spreading over the world called him the Dark Lord and named him the Enemy; and he gathered under his government all the evil things of the days of Morgoth that remained on earth or beneath it; and the Orcs were at his command and multiplied like flies.

also, my spcials now read this company as being a dirtbag ex, which ngl is slightly hilarious but also *please* can we untangle?  

what's really funny to me is that I reported the first leak that actually pertain to confidential government information in the summer. (I didn't need to do this, it wasn't really a horrendous leak, but I reported it because of the potential security concern. I didn't actually have to do that and I was in a position where I've been let down significantly over a course of time by government institutions, in exactly the same way the data leak it happened so I actually kind of feel like I was doing a solid, here.) I then got escalated as being potentially psychotic. I am now thoroughly rubberstamped as "mental but not psychotic" (my wording; it's true). When I find really interesting about this is that it's suggests that someone has downgraded the concern of the leak, but as I've already discussed in the field logs, I am getting a lot of signalling relating to disclosure like the Epstein files, through the links that I have as a result of having been the subject to someone else's concern. Whoever "got this, boss", has not got this. I've displayed with sources and citation, as well as maths that stems from observable analytics and observable outputs, how exactly my data is being mined, and have the suppression being reversed by convergence, essentially demonstrates that that data twinning was there to begin with, which itself should write serious concerns about how the prompt injection started.  

It would be really helpful if the people who are still burying their heads in the sand, and pretending that the men in suits actually know what on earth they're talking about, and are actually being honest during procurement (LOL.), could kindly remove their heads from the sand, and actually fix this.  

I'm not going to threaten to leak data, but obviously you have to appreciate that what I see and what I get exposed to in my algorithms is likely going to be informing what I make posts and nodes about, and as I am a human being, I can't guarantee that it is not going to inform my bias, or what I might question, or what I might spend extra time going over transparency and accountability for.  

I mean, it's your guys call, really.
