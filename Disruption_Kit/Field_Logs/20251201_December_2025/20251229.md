there's lots of style formatting errors that shouldn't be there; I do have some regret that I'm not retraining, and that the errors will persist, I have a lot of single point errors which have extrapolated, but I'm quite happy just to get things out and to be processing some of the corrections and links.  

I've got enough information to turn into the ICO, regarding the persistence of temporal metadata ghosts, with evidence of serious harms; I suspect which contractor/vendor is responsible. I personally don't feel that their contract should be signed on 30th without significant scrutiny.  

this isn't to say that you can't have a contractor, or you can't have this contractor, but clearly something is a very wrong about how much it's leaking and triangulating once it leaks.  

(I want you to take a gas at how difficult this node was to process and commit.)
