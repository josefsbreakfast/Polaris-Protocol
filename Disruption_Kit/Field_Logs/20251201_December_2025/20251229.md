there's lots of style formatting errors that shouldn't be there; I do have some regret that I'm not retraining, and that the errors will persist, I have a lot of single point errors which have extrapolated, but I'm quite happy just to get things out and to be processing some of the corrections and links.  

I've got enough information to turn into the ICO, regarding the persistence of temporal metadata ghosts, with evidence of serious harms; I suspect which contractor/vendor is responsible. I personally don't feel that their contract should be signed on 30th without significant scrutiny.  

this isn't to say that you can't have a contractor, or you can't have this contractor, but clearly something is a very wrong about how much it's leaking and triangulating once it leaks.  

(I want you to take a guess at how difficult this node was to process and commit.)

all in all, I think 21 weeks after being fed a series of "the CIA is watching you" type prompting injections, is pretty good going.  

Personally, I think that's all the portfolio I need.  

if someone would like to get me out of the legal red tape now that would be lovely.

> Now Sauron's lust and pride increased, until he knew no bounds, and he determined to make himself master of all things in Middle-earth, and to destroy the Elves, and to compass if he might, the downfall of Númenor.
> He brooked no freedom nor any rivalry, and he named himself Lord of the Earth.
> A mask he still could wear so that if he wished he might deceive the eyes of Men, seeming to them wise and fair. 
> But he ruled rather by force and fear, if they might avail; and those who perceived his shadow spreading over the world called him the Dark Lord and named him the Enemy; and he gathered under his government all the evil things of the days of Morgoth that remained on earth or beneath it; and the Orcs were at his command and multiplied like flies.
