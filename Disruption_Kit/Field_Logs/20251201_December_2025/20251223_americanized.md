I've just had a really good sleep.  

After being found to probably not be in psychosis 🤣🤣🤣  

It's amazing how clearheaded you can be, once you have five minutes to think.  

It's all very Americanised, isn't it?  

There are lots of British people who put on the airs of the American.  

But there is a nexus of information and knowledge and behaviours, and once you have those three sides, you can make a triangle.  

"Don't be scared. Don't be shy. Come on in; the water's fine."  

*Get your hands up.*

(This would explain some of the puppets.)  

*Get your fucking hands up.*  

Esther was a Queen.  

*"I'm talking to you; get the fuck up."  

that would explain why a lot of material is being taken up by the very antiauthoritarian, "we are British we are an island leave us alone", YouTube politics crowd.  

I am not offended; this is basically my childhood dream.  

I'll tell you about the time I told one of my Geordie grandparents that I wanted to be Margaret Thatcher, because she was the first female Prime Minister, when I grew up, later.  
<!--Incidentally, my miner's lung great-grandfather died around the same time, essentially partially from these complications and how they show up in healthcare; will discuss teaching the boarding school crowd about miner's knee another time. Empathy does exist; there is a reason we are divided, chaps.-->
Lead balloon. That was the conservative voter in the family. That's how deep this shit is up north.  

Although let's not pretend there were not a cabinet of men backing her.  

Puppeteering, one might say.

(It's not that the other grandparents were southern. It's that I'd need to start explaining individual mining villages to you. I appreciate that this is a little bit much for the brain cells which pipe out adverts like the ones I've just had for the publications I've just had. Better to keep it simple with a classics-heavy crossword for you all. Remembering a few tragedies, I appreciate is a little easier on your minds then folk culture above Cambridgeshire.)  

(That is, after all, where The Rebellion lives.)
