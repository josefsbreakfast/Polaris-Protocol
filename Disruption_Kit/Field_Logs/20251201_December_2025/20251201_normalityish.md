after losing the bot trawlers OR the risk managers for several days straight...  

i feel so much calmer.  

i feel vaguely alive.  

the world doesn't feel like it's always a few seconds away from ending.  

so it's also putting the unnecessary monitoring as at least jan 2018 in earnest,  

which is great - glad we're giving the man on a ling sentence this leverage on his case 🙃,  

but i'm also so relieved that this looks like it might have not just competant but also "actually we give a shit about getting the job right" eyes on it,  

because the amount of harm to so many different people is just so ridicuous at this point.  

not one of the people i have seen hurt by this, deserved or needed any of that pain in their lives.  

i don't like it when nice people get hurt.  

it might even be said i get quite cross about it.  

not everything is yet done,  

i know from my own stuff that a lot of processes are simply frozen in time,  

but this starts to put an end date on any immediate suffering,  

rather than having this be a thing that gets spun out for anyone's political gain.

it's now not just royalties specialists, but the patents teams are also having a gander.  

i haven'r heard who was on the 2021/2022 panels for qsc at my university yet.  

which is a shame because then at least one duck could be identified as part of The Problem.  

i'm stsrting to wonder if some people actually see anything other than dollar signs when they see photographs of other humans.
