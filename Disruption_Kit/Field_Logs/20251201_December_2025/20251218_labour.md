[I don't care how accurate it is. Some men need this exposure therapy.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRY9Rgcf/)  

All I feel like I think about now is rape, on a loop.  

This is the cost of narrative.  

I look at a world like this, and it's difficult to believe that men as a group do not, in fact, hate us.  

I just wish they were honest; I wish they just said they didn't like women.  

My feed has been behaving like a creepy, overbearingly sexual man for two days, with what are clearly adacent people's content.  

I just want the honesty. I just don't think you enjoy the comosmy of women, respect the bodies of men as their own sovereign territory, or see our labour as anything but your born privilsge to dictate.

[Oh look, the squid gets it.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRYH7AHf/)  

I think a lot about poetry and songs where women express desire for the decay stages post-mortem because at least then they *might* be safe (although not always), or wish to have an unmarked resting place because it will keep them away from their being treated as property against their wishes in life.  

I know that not every man will change.  
I just want some of you to be more honest.  

There are men who are able to be fully human; it's not a default, and I wish we would stop pretending it was.  

I never deserved this.

[The feed also recommends so much Russian to me specifically, even though most of my instigated searches are in Ukrainian. More than it presents Aliyah, in the last 6-9 months. Does make you wonder about the loyalties of whoever is in the most adjacent space...](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRY9M5HF/)

Something else that I've noticed come up, is some sort of inflection around, "why is she so bothered?".  

If your voice was used against your will, stolen from you, to make claims which you are very aware are damaging not only to men you're innocent but also to your own validity as a survivor of other men's violence, you too would be *pissed off*.  

This is equivalent to the value of someone's good word; if you're a good word was misused, against your will, stolen from you, and there was continued resistance to giving you the answers that you need to understand what happened?  

I think that would piss most men off, if it happened to them.  

This isn't about having any degree of kindness or compassion or favour to anyone; this can exist completely independently of the fact that I'm fucked off that someone misused my likeness to make untrue claims.  

That's before we even get to what else happened to put pressure on.  

But yes, if you must know, I am being incredibly British and incredibly masculine about it; it is the principle of the matter.
