[I don't care how accurate it is. Some men need this exposure therapy.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRY9Rgcf/)  

All I feel like I think about now is rape, on a loop.  

This is the cost of narrative.  

I look at a world like this, and it's difficult to believe that men as a group do not, in fact, hate us.  

I just wish they were honest; I wish they just said they didn't like women.  

My feed has been behaving like a creepy, overbearingly sexual man for two days, with what are clearly adacent people's content.  

I just want the honesty. I just don't think you enjoy the comosmy of women, respect the bodies of men as their own sovereign territory, or see our labour as anything but your born privilsge to dictate.

[Oh look, the squid gets it.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRYH7AHf/)  

I think a lot about poetry and songs where women express desire for the decay stages post-mortem because at least then they *might* be safe (although not always), or wish to have an unmarked resting place because it will keep them away from their being treated as property against their wishes in life.  

I know that not every man will change.  
I just want some of you to be more honest.  

There are men who are able to be fully human; it's not a default, and I wish we would stop pretending it was.  

I never deserved this.
