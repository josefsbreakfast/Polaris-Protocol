[I don't care how accurate it is. Some men need this exposure therapy.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRY9Rgcf/)  

All I feel like I think about now is rape, on a loop.  

This is the cost of narrative.  

I look at a world like this, and it's difficult to believe that men as a group do not, in fact, hate us.  

I just wish they were honest; I wish they just said they didn't like women.  

My feed has been behaving like a creepy, overbearingly sexual man for two days, with what are clearly adacent people's content.  

I just want the honesty. I just don't think you enjoy the comosmy of women, respect the bodies of men as their own sovereign territory, or see our labour as anything but your born privilsge to dictate.
