See attached three new screenshots.  

I was sort of hoping that it was all about how great I was, and not a man, but no. 🙄  

I am personally very upset to be less interesting than some professor if I don't know what politics or non-healthcare PPE or something.  

It is incredibly rude.  

But I also think this is a really good example of how sometimes when people are... (to avoid a particular word, that we all get a little triggered by in the group chat, we shall go for the lay term:) "fucked with", it's equally possible that it's got nothing ready to do with anything that you did or did not do. And honestly, some people just have the money and time to be able to make a whole chain of people, just prove a point. Because it's a chain now, like a really big knot of old jewellry, and "there is no butter in Hell".  

Something I will say, though is that whoever came up with the idea to use a week of performance redaction software, and bank on poor governance literacy? Genius.  

The NHS pays out the nose to make sure that can never happen; complete ballache.
