"Glitch warning. ToS DDoS warning."  

See attached screenshots.  

Multiple "glitches" and failures across apps.  

No single clear cause.  

All accessibility impacted, even for mundane tasks.  

Internet increasingly patchy since Thurs eve.  

Python/markdown rules failing on genAI; increased vulnerabilities appearing after new session starts.  

Last similar impact Aug/Sept 2025; required executive tier escalation in UK to re-assert data control.  

This corresponded with Polaris take-down under "crypto farm" rules.

Social apps force closing, reloading, resets accessibility settings.
