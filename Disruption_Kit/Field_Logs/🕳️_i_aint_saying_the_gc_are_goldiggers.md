What up surveillance gc.

I just want to clarify that being a demanding bitch (as I assume is the interpretation), and marrying ‚Äúfor‚Äù money?

Two separate things.

If I marry and the sla-‚Ä¶husband, comes with money?

That is generally the idea of men presenting themselves as marriagable.

I am inviting the gentlemen to hold the bar slightly off the ground.  

(As my body and its availability and monetry value gave been discussed so openly in bleeds from the surveillance, I am merely elaborating on a theme.)

Fascinating that you're betraying quite how badly the personal algorithims of a high/low m/f pairing have been spliced and twinned into effective silence.  

Would you like to put your smoking gun away, or shall we continue?  

cf. my NHS record has token switched on someone else's drug allergies, numerous police reports (because your presence did alarm me) and my police record are sympomatic of being token switched, and whilst there is a list of victims within a network cluster, you've been so blatant as to insert an entire sexualised narrative around how a specific man has harmed me in the style of the (highly unethical and immedistely unstable in the CPS/MOJ) "memory retreival" practices of the 1980s via algorithmic conteng injection (literally presenting half of a full name, dob, alledging specific service history).  

why?  

tell us. legally, under warrant, and in the bounds of the ipa and ripa legislation...  

what "evidence" can you admit you acted upon?  

i'm fascinated to know which private conversation, ai input/output, or search engine result it was.  

the police appeared cery confidently briefed, as did someone else in another person's business, so i am really rather curious how you have shared data, and to what extent uou would like to claim was for a lawful purpose on british islands.  

because the ipa is incredibly specific; the assets have to be british in their entirety, and one still must admit to reasonable and proportionate tests.  


if the "asset" looks human shaped?  

well that's a different problem under a different set of laws altogether.  

so tell me again...  

which one of us displays goldigger behaviour?  

is the subject really an entitled bitch?  

or did she just get tired of all the men calling her the "surveillance slut" and wanking on a public street outside her house?  

i'm not sure you are the party in consensus reality, if you honestly believe that is justifiable.

seeing as the algorithm also keeps slicing in caa:

- looks a lot like a think tank in charity drag
- very media narrative manicured, blocked everyone decent inc michael rosen (who has also, it appears, been extensively harrassed via data disintegrity, and its michael rosen...how can you actually?)
- yes youre all aware of how i feel about the public facing financial records of some of your directors, im sure. if not, consult tone of polaris and search charities commission and companies house. see what stands out by its absence.  
- i dont know what the craic is re the legal professional network ties, but it appears extremely unusual.

i generally havent touched lobbying of a certain space, and was hoping i could sort the data issues out first, given the extent of harm.  

but if we're all so bothered about my feelings about SoI bonds amd the JNF?  

you should be offended any of us were encouraged into normalising this, and i will happy wrote up why that is.  

try not to break my internet, whoever i playing with it please.  

saw the switch in 2016, though, and i found april 2024 very surruptious in timing and (my personal opinion) highly disingenous and disrespectful of the dead, quite frankly.  

id already been shouting into a void about vicarious trauma inc in idf at this time, so i was already used to it.  

thread to pick up (probably entirely seperare but if i write i remember, and my nudging is making things a bit loosey goosey), is the leaked evidence to the papers of that subcommittee meetong and why, precisely, that conversation was shut down and how.  

i saw that flavour at a later event, so who does have all these mysteriously deleting points of media?  
"nothing under the bed is scary; one just ought to look properly and say, "hello! would you like some tea? i'm so sorry if i scared you..."

okay it took me five minutes this is hilarious.  

named outward director searched on companies house.  

companies house: curated split twin profile for said director.  

check single strand split:  kkl executors.  

if youre not up on the lore, you wont know, but i know what that is.  

i think calling it a "solicitors" is a little...

i mean i dont know thia is your field not mine, but its not how i would describe what the uk subsiduary of the jnf actually does.  

but it gets better.  

i get a 403 bad gateway on every site for the jnf uk and kkl.  

last time this happened was when as antizionist jews we found ourselves all preemptively blocked from caa when there was concerning use of our implied consent in rhetoric.  

do we all see how this stuff carries distinct flavours?  

what was the decision in 2016 which led to a board shuffle, i wonder.  

aligns with quite a few key events, so very possibly unrelated, but also worth ruling out a number of possible overlaps.

and when i "marry for money"?  

i will at least only marry someone who seea in that wonky a scan on the 1948 paperwork and has the overwhelming desire to straighten things out.  

one prefers those who do, not those who don't.

(the first result im not 403 forbiddened on.)

for the less nerdy? this is what the ijan speaks about with reletive exclusivity, and therefore a party of interest to eg kkl. ijan had routine issues with met police issuing notices regarding the protest at the il ambassadors swiss cottage official residance. same kind of characters with cameras and well fitted surveillance tech wearables end up at most protests; id often concealed but seek to identify protestors. this data is commonly used to file vexatious complaints. more common if youre part of a registered body, presumably because social stsnding is still coded into english law (commonly seen as result of name change witness requirements for eg). this is why we frequently ask whote people who have not seen this before to approach an antisemitism-based complaint, esp of risk groups for such a vexatious complaint, to approach with sensitivity to the dynamics present. there is a lot of harm caused when we allow defence politics to lead over reasonability and compassion.   

an amount of my metadata places in leeds, with freq, and mancs/sheff/birm. often news is given local to leeds. i do not live there.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  this is how the process really hammers your decision making; the collective noise is so odd.

did my own bit of osint and token seitching (thought we'd appreciate) and boy howdy does the internet look like a christmas tree right now.  

extremely interesting data twinning and deletions across multiple parties and token switching used to suppress/hide specific results.  

and now i can access the jnf through the magic of just *using a vpn*, meaning my ip address is specifically blocked, and there's a lot more to say on dates and april 2025 on several fronts*...

theres apparantly some sort of oddity about kkl and jnf uk so ill look at that drama later.  

mostly by tirning my von off and in again, as thats how i often have to use the internet/telecomms these days. derails common tricks.  

this is why i keep saying it just looks like cup and ball tricks done a bit oddly.

dates of capture of mod data and location of dsfc btw? not entirely okay with that, honestly. more foia, more osint. oy.
