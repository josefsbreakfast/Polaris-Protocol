What up surveillance gc.

I just want to clarify that being a demanding bitch (as I assume is the interpretation), and marrying “for” money?

Two separate things.

If I marry and the sla-…husband, comes with money?

That is generally the idea of men presenting themselves as marriagable.

I am inviting the gentlemen to hold the bar slightly off the ground.  

(As my body and its availability and monetry value gave been discussed so openly in bleeds from the surveillance, I am merely elaborating on a theme.)

Fascinating that you're betraying quite how badly the personal algorithims of a high/low m/f pairing have been spliced and twinned into effective silence.  

Would you like to put your smoking gun away, or shall we continue?  

cf. my NHS record has token switched on someone else's drug allergies, numerous police reports (because your presence did alarm me) and my police record are sympomatic of being token switched, and whilst there is a list of victims within a network cluster, you've been so blatant as to insert an entire sexualised narrative around how a specific man has harmed me in the style of the (highly unethical and immedistely unstable in the CPS/MOJ) "memory retreival" practices of the 1980s via algorithmic conteng injection (literally presenting half of a full name, dob, alledging specific service history).  

why?  

tell us. legally, under warrant, and in the bounds of the ipa and ripa legislation...  

what "evidence" can you admit you acted upon?  

i'm fascinated to know which private conversation, ai input/output, or search engine result it was.  

the police appeared cery confidently briefed, as did someone else in another person's business, so i am really rather curious how you have shared data, and to what extent uou would like to claim was for a lawful purpose on british islands.  

because the ipa is incredibly specific; the assets have to be british in their entirety, and one still must admit to reasonable and proportionate tests.  


if the "asset" looks human shaped?  

well that's a different problem under a different set of laws altogether.  

so tell me again...  

which one of us displays goldigger behaviour?  

is the subject really an entitled bitch?  

or did she just get tired of all the men calling her the "surveillance slut" and wanking on a public street outside her house?  

i'm not sure you are the party in consensus reality, if you honestly believe that is justifiable.
