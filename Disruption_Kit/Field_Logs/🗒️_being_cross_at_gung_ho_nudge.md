# 🗒️ Field Note — Being Cross at Gung-Ho Nudge  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Captures survivor’s emotional response to the discovery that evidence-based cautions on behavioural insights were noted but ignored in UK politics (2014–2016).*  

---

## 🌐 Summary  
Anger and frustration at the way British politics adopted nudging as a flagship solution while sidelining sensible cautions. The pattern is cultural: “gung-ho” optimism overriding systemic correction, producing shallow quick fixes.  

---

## 👁️ Observed Emotional Response  
- Anger that sensible witness evidence was ignored.  
- Frustration at the “gung-ho, this’ll fix it!” instinct.  
- Rejection of the narrative: *“no babe, it really won’t.”*  
- Recognition that affect belongs in the archive: the emotional register matters as much as the institutional record.  

---

## 🔎 Why This Matters  
- Capturing emotional response documents the **human impact of systemic dismissal**.  
- Shows how political style (optimism bias, short-termism) generates not only policy risks but emotional alienation.  
- Maintains survivor authorship: subjective voice sits beside factual nodes as part of the archive.
