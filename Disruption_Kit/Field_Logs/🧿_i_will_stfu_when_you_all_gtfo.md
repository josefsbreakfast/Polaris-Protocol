while we're here, this is clustered with a narrative device that appears to be a mistelling of a very short story in 2020.  

"this person broke your heart"?  

please.  

someone is gettong their "facts" from extremely dodgy sources.  

none of that is how any of that happened.  

that's not even "difference of opinion" territory.  

if that's your understanding, then someone who knows better has knowingly told you the wrong story.  

and that's why you keep stepping in narrative landmines; they have not uxo marked anything for you.  

even if they promised you they did.  

keep stepping if you wish. 🤷‍♀️
