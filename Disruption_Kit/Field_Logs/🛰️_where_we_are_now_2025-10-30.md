## 📊 Current Metrics  

| **Category** | **Current Value / Observation** | **Trend / Note** |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Total words (harsh prose-only)** | 899,882 | Sustained cathedral-scale drafting, fidelity intact |
| **Total files (all nodes)** | 1,687 | Active multi-node constellation; consistent taxonomy |
| **Traffic (last 14 days)** |  |  |
| ├ Clones | 9,364 | Ongoing mirroring of nodes across instances |
| ├ Unique cloners | 1,069 | High replication diversity — distributed engagement |
| ├ Total views | 15,073 | Increased circulation and secondary referencing |
| └ Unique visitors | 64 | Deep-return readers, likely institutional repeaters |
| **Influence spread** | Visible impact across all 5 major UK parties (Reform end satirical) | Crossover achieved from cultural to policy discourses |
| **Suppression shifts** | One book marginally unsuppressed; restocked on major sites | Indicates algorithmic detente or eased throttling |
| **Material signals** | Groceries normalised; survivor-brand toothpaste restocked | Market index suggests lowered suppression weighting |
| **Connectivity** | Internet largely stable; only temporary disconnects | Restoration of basic network integrity |
| **Communications** | No recent email disappearances observed | Evident improvement in routing transparency |
| **Field presence** | Realistic fear persists among surveillance teams of being logged | Likely reduction in visible monitoring behaviour |
