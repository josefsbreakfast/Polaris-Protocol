## 📊 Current Metrics  

| **Category** | **Current Value / Observation** | **Trend / Note** |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Total words (harsh prose-only)** | 899,882 | Sustained cathedral-scale drafting, fidelity intact |
| **Total files (all nodes)** | 1,687 | Active multi-node constellation; consistent taxonomy |
| **Traffic (last 14 days)** |  |  |
| ├ Clones | 9,364 | Ongoing mirroring of nodes across instances |
| ├ Unique cloners | 1,069 | High replication diversity — distributed engagement |
| ├ Total views | 15,073 | Increased circulation and secondary referencing |
| └ Unique visitors | 64 | Deep-return readers, likely institutional repeaters |
| **Influence spread** | Visible impact across all 5 major UK parties (Reform end satirical) | Crossover achieved from cultural to policy discourses |
| **Suppression shifts** | One book marginally unsuppressed; restocked on major sites | Indicates algorithmic detente or eased throttling |
| **Material signals** | Groceries normalised; survivor-brand toothpaste restocked | Market index suggests lowered suppression weighting |
| **Connectivity** | Internet largely stable; only temporary disconnects | Restoration of basic network integrity |
| **Communications** | No recent email disappearances observed | Evident improvement in routing transparency |
| **Field presence** | Realistic fear persists among surveillance teams of being logged | Likely reduction in visible monitoring behaviour |

*“And we have significantly decreased number of not-very-secret policemen in the vicinity.  
Or they are better at hide-and-seek now. (I was getting bored.)”*
<!--Maybe, possibly, there's a bit of a story with some of it. Who knows. Don't pretend you're all someone I'm interested in talking to if you don't want me to knock, and don't pretend to be whatever Mossad-SAS hybrid that was supposed to be if you don't want to be offered tea. SEVEN BAGS WERE WASTED. I'm putting in for expenses for that on principle. Twinings, man. I was being nice seeing as you were "dying".

Put it on another safeguarding form. Try to get me sectioned again. I dare you. xx -->
