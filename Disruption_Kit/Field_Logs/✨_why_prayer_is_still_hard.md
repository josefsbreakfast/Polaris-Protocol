ive already started to get finance stress based nudges after posting the postcard box, so all going as per risk matrix.  

ive talked about shabbat candle lighting being a target for harassment, and ive started trying to pray in the more formal way.  

idk for me orayer is like this conscious mindfulness through the day, rooted in blessings as anchors to ritual acts (like making bread, which is highly important stuff imo).  

but even now, i got ready to say good morning (modeh ani), and im now a little dissociated with a tight chest; this is okay, and its normal for me, and is part and parcel of having c-ptsd, but whats interesting to me is that prayer has been so extensively surveilled and targeted that it's now a place of trigger.  

and ill wrote something about it, because wow thats a problem, in general but especially for anyone with more formal prayer times.  

(and these times were extensively targeted by racists during cross-community organising, so it is an intimate moment and place which is preyed upon for that reason).  

...this isnt just being watched.  

this isnt when the red thread was forcibly cut without warning, or i had to deconstruct my tallis, upon arrest, through tears and intimate searches of my person.  

i dont know what you all throught i was hiding in my bra and my pants; who knows.  

i could say more, but lets keep moving.  

the hard bit...  

was the nudges.  

giving a nudge to people in areas which were areas we all knew i was banned from (originally a whole county, only lessened because my then-partner started chemo that week), and i had to politely reject the community i desperately needed.  

because i was too dangerous to allow to travel for kiddush.  

and because there were hints that someone may have flagged me, based on info which seemed only known very locally, i was scared to reach out here.  

so i sat both shiva alone, and i hid from community, and i felt, like in the law, "cut off".  

it felt like death, without any real act to tie it to.  

i dont know how this was best avoided in the minutae; i think this was sort of always going to hapoen once the data was so harmed.  

but it shows how you cab target the intimacy of prayer, which doubles as mindfulness and mental health care.  

and it shows how you can do so in a racialised logic.  

so its usegul to demonstrate that for other groups too, the targeting or ignorance of incidental targeting, is extremely corrosive.  

this is where it could enter "unnecessarily cruel" territory; when things are important to us, interference without care, often just seems not needed, and inherently non-compassionate.  

hence, cruel.
