# 🧩 The Politic Is No Longer Heard  
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-11  
*On the vanishing feedback loop between public life and political hearing.*
<!--Whoever nudged this? They can put their choice of givernment in power. I'm sure that won't go wrong.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Once, representatives heard the hum of the public directly — in halls, pubs, libraries, and queues.  
Now, they hear mostly from *metrics*: dashboards, polling segments, and sentiment analysis.  
The **politic** — the living civic chorus — has been replaced by **the dataset**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Loss of relational infrastructure:** decline of unions, local press, and civic halls.  
- **Mediated hearing:** social media managers, analytics teams, and party comms as buffers.  
- **Algorithmic feedback:** politicians “listen” to dashboards, not to citizens.  
- **Security logic creep:** risk-managed public events, appointment-only surgeries.  
- **Disenfranchised constituencies:** those most harmed are least able to access the remaining routes of voice.

## 🧿 Analysis  
The modern representative hears through *abstraction*.  
Where there was once dialogue, there is now *sampling*.  
The feedback loop has been digitised, sanitised, and de-risked — making discontent invisible until it breaks containment.  

In this silence, the democratic contract frays.  
If voice only travels through data, it becomes hostage to the same visibility economies that govern everything else online.

Re-hearing the politic will mean rebuilding *non-transactional* spaces: slow, local, analogue, and embodied — where risk is relational, not statistical.

*The Politic Is No Longer Heard* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It examines how democratic feedback has been replaced by algorithmic hearing, and why civic repair requires re-embodied dialogue.
