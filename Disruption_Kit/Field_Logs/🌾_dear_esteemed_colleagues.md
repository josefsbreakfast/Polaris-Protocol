could you kindly be less obvious.  

please see last x2 images.  

you are making our country look weak and feeble talking about an entirely normal human process.  

the emoji was the closest i could get to a stalk; i think we may need to check if the top brass actually know where their own babies came from.  

competant kniwledge of standard mechanism is, apparantly, unclear.  

obviously this will now enter the chat in other ways, so if you could kindly get-to on the myriad of data requests that sit uncomfortably close to your remit?  

all the best --
