if we're twinned for having two halves of an answer of systematic wrongdoing, i'm going to need the po-po to take a chill pill over, "hey, i think someone is like...really going hard on trying to undermine one of your policy dudes"  

because i know why i was shunted away from ukhsa i think and why my online interference worsened in 2020.  

i'm not saying i was great, but it was the tricounty/boundary problem.  

we don't need to take this shit to the moon, we just need the trash to leave the building.  

across a bunch of our collective domains (of people i'm mysteriously contained from) -- we're all looking at easy systematic issues to fix.  

interesting stuff, but there's something specific we're all sitting on which is "how do we deal with dissent".  

a lot of interest in that market, it seems.  

and me feed is a wild wild thing atm.
