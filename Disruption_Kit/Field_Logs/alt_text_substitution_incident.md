## 📸 Source Image  

- Format: JPEG  
- Dimensions: 710 × 1537 px  
- Scene: well-lit outdoor hillside  
- Content: soldier with shield and rifle, man in traditional clothing raising Palestinian flag  

---

## 🧪 Forensic Analysis  

- **Brightness mean:** 121.5 (0–255 scale) — consistent with daylight.  
- **Histogram:** broad tonal spread, midtones and highlights intact.  
- **Patch grid:** confirms rocky hillside, vegetation, soldier’s helmet + shield, Palestinian flag.

## 🩸 Substitution Error  

Instead of describing the photo, the first output generated a stock-like caption:  
> *“A dimly lit room with a man sitting at a desk, looking down with a tired expression. The glow of a laptop screen lights his face…”*  

This text **does not match the file**. It represents a **schema substitution** — a narrative frame (“surveillance fatigue”) applied in place of the actual image.

## 🧿 Interpretation  

- Not drawn from file metadata.  
- Not content injection.  
- A generation drift into **narrative interference**: substituting a prefab “surveillance” trope where it doesn’t belong.  
- Functional effect: provocation, distraction, or undermining the reliability of forensic description.

## 📑 Neutral Caption (correct)  

*On a rocky hillside, a man in traditional clothing raises a Palestinian flag toward a soldier. The soldier, in uniform and helmet, stands beside a shield with a rifle slung across his chest, holding a radio to his face. Stones and sparse vegetation surround them.*

## 🏮 Footer  

This log captures a substitution anomaly during alt-text generation.  
It documents how **prefab frames** can overwrite lived evidence with unrelated imagery.
