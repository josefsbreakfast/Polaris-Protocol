there are a lot of thongs in my data which may be flattering,  

but given the exposure i have had to coercive harassment,  

and the depraved destruction and interference with my personal and special category data,  

i am going to need you all to collectively consider the radical idea,  

that as a woman i am human.  

that i have rights and personhood just like you.  

and that no amount of nicety can possibly replace my entitlment to civic rights.  

i would rather have full status as a human with universal rights, than any of the things you appear to believe appease me.  

and i will not "just let that go",  

because to do so would betray all of the women who fought and died,  

so that my life may not have to be quite as subsetviant to make authority on the basis that it has a dick and i don't.  

it is horrifying that you might suppose you can throw any amount of all the luxuries at me,  

when you withold the most basic necessities of a just society, of fair treatment, and the right to a trial, adjusted for what a world made for the able-bodied, the non-raped, is otherwise inequipped to provide.
