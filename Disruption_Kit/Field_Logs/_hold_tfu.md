something i kept contesting but was repeatedly ignored was this:  

my address on the arrest matched how i styled it for parcels from indie sellers, and the kb case, which was (again) a sealed case.  

so there appears to be a data leak where i have been arrested for "something else" using the kb-obtained address.  

i would get told this was a "very serious accusation" (i mean, isn't it your collective speciality to investigate this sort of wrongdoing? especially if you kow i'm reporting harrassment at my house that magically cannot be located on cctv in a city centre? idk man seems weird to me.).  

not once, with every man who openly masterbated on or around the property where i live, did anyone ever see that as a potential risk factor, or something a bit weird.  

so where do we go from "address given to kings bench at birmingham", to "random men wakung outside my door".  

because that, to me, reads like an address leak.  

and added to csa court case leaks online?  

it's reading as "men's rights, we can fuck who we want when they say no, we're masterrace material", type of fucked up guys who know each other.  

one police constabulary will not even answer a sar.  

guess who.

<!--3 years of lost biometric data across a range of violent crimes? how... unfortnate. for victims, i mean. or those who are truly wrongfully accused. enjoy the free lunch, lads. -->

and the emotional gaslighting from the content feed restarts, like clockwork.  

idk why you would think what you're trying to encourage me to do is either normal or within my normal range of behaviours.  

if you want to go and chat up a dude, you don't need me to stand in youtr way.
