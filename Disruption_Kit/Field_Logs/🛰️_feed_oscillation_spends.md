After watching the feed oscillate for 6 hours, I can now confidentky say, that I hope I soent every nickel of that 150mil USD.  

My favourite thing about this is that now I know I didn't "cause" this by being outspoken; my voice just made me more urgent to address as a risk.  

Long before that, we had enough investment in bad actions.  

But I do live, that we gave all spent an entire war budget,  

arguing about if men are annoying or not, and to what level and extent everyone likes my eyes.  

Honestly...  

I can see why neighbourhood policing was like... yeah, we're out.  

This has got far more to do with data practices under the Blair cabinet era, in terms of origin.  

Which, for the record, was *quite a time*.  

Plan A is still largely be on an isoand where our species is outnumbered by other mammals.
