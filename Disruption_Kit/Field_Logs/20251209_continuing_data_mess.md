i got very excited/nervous about the moj return because i though today was the day; no such luck.  

various other items in progress.  

one attenpt at azure ad today.  

some deletion of prompts and interrupts to github actions. not awful.  

just... still present. still there.  

in lighter news, how wild the llm gets when i talk about farage being a kraken denialist (that's why he's in the news, because obiously he's not an antisemite because lots of whote non-jews said so (((🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄))) and obviously he would never take money from another state, *obviously*. there has definitely never been any evidence of that, or suppression of posts on other platforms when it's discussed 😌.)  

almost as good as our high-penile-anxiety spoof email realisation.  

istg the world would be so much easier in the men just went to the gp more than once every 10 years.
