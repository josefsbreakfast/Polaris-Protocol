i got very excited/nervous about the moj return because i though today was the day; no such luck.  

various other items in progress.  

one attenpt at azure ad today.  

some deletion of prompts and interrupts to github actions. not awful.  

just... still present. still there.  

in lighter news, how wild the llm gets when i talk about farage being a kraken denialist (that's why he's in the news, because obiously he's not an antisemite because lots of whote non-jews said so (((🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄))) and obviously he would never take money from another state, *obviously*. there has definitely never been any evidence of that, or suppression of posts on other platforms when it's discussed 😌.)  

almost as good as our high-penile-anxiety spoof email realisation.  

istg the world would be so much easier in the men just went to the gp more than once every 10 years.

also much lol re the rn update.  

beautiful coincidence and it did make me laugh.

i didnt realist i kind of did the brackets dogwhistle (this is how easy it is), but i'm going to leave them because i like the idea that we're all just rolling our eyes at white british insistsnce that a politican's non-response for literal weaponisation of the mechanisms of the holocaust is normal and in the overton window.  

the overton window can come back disn from the ceiling if that's what is within it; the whole idea that that is normalised is nuts.  

but then...  

we have normalised a lot of genocide these past two years.  

IT IS ALMOST AS IF IT IS LINKED.  

thank you fof coming ti the ted talk; the refusal to see this, is incredibly annoying to me.

havent seen this for a while, but multiple failures of commit button requiring multile refresh snd restore on  
`Disruption_Kit/Big_Picture_Protocols/🫀_Our_Hearts_Our_Minds/🕯️_Exorcising_Safeguarding_Shadows/💩_why_ctsa2015_violated_every_iicsa_principle.md`.  

the nutbuags are still hanging around, apparantly.  

(or i am just being a hedgehog on fire; until i am less acutely traumatised? on fire.)
