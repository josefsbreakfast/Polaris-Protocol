# 🛰️ Behavior-First Framing — Field Log  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Field log documenting analytic reflection on prioritising behaviour/impact over ideological labels, and the insertion of this framing into the Patterns node.*

## 📅 Event Summary (Factual)  
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20  
- **Item updated:** `💸_russian_overlap_patterns.md`  
- **Action:** Appended *“Behavior-First Framing: Impact Over Labels”* to the Patterns node.  
- **Observed anomaly:** None noted; recorded as analytic context for future investigations.

## 👁️ User Observations  
- Citizens lack access to classified datasets; rely instead on behavioural/impact analysis.  
- Assess actions (disinformation, surveillance sales, financial flows) before assigning ideological labels.  
- Policy and comms should reduce partisan framing and focus on harm and mitigations.  

---

## ⚙️ Operational Recommendations  
1. Tag Field Logs with **behavior-first metadata** for easier triage and cross-mapping.  
2. Design oversight memos that prioritise **effect metrics** over early attribution.  
3. Use public language that emphasises **harm/method** rather than actor identity unless attribution is strongly supported.
