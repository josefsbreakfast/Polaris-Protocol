- 249 outstanding on pre-polaris intake
- plus 5 or so ready to upload
- plus the intake drawer

- shatterfork is wobbly.
- mostly gone, does keep reoccuring.
- im not usually as blunt as i am here, but being cross out loud here is the only thing that gets me any closer to human beings reading my requests (which are responsibe to harm and anchored in lawful use of dpa).

- i really just want someone to say, "its okay", and someone else to say, "you can talk to people normally now".
- in lieu of that, "we can see something doesnt look right, let us look into this for you, give us [X time] to respond" would work, too.

- its almost like everyone is getting nudged off the computer the minute the email is opened; its so strange that its taking thos much push and for so long.
