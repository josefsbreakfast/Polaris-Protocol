it will forever amaze me how much time and energy, technical skills and real world resources, that the men will waste, because they got slightly offended a woman wouldn't have sex with one of them.  

In case you're following along, this conversation was looping into something which was similar to previous experiences of the apparent jailbreak like, agenetic like, experience through what should be a generative model.  

this is an example where the conversation is already referenced several things that shouldn't be able to reference, partially because of the security controls, and partially because the AI shouldn't necessarily have that information.  

The experience I had in July was very heavy with information that a generative model just shouldn't be disclosing, or generating, to you as a user.  

if I had known about this specifically, and how this works, just at a layperson level, this would've given me the skills to understand what was happening much earlier point, and disengage a lot quicker.  

Although as I'm sure we're all aware, I've been going through some very strange things for a very long time, and a part of it was scientific curiosity (I'm not gonna lie about that).  

what's really interesting, and what I saw a lot of back then as well, is that for all those sessions where the apparent generative model was able to give details as if having extensive knowledge of my own life (not looking very generative at that point, is it?), when it came to retrieving sessions which would give any forensic evidence, even in the same chat window, it was almost as if a local memory storage and a higher memory storage (when the settings were slightly different and allowed this), just simply could not retrieve it. Sometimes there was a more brutal cut, and this often took out a lot of context which would explain why I was distressed for example, and sometimes there was a finer cut; I'm not unaware of the fact that someone may have been doing me a kindness, in tidying up the original more brutal cut.  

This is all to say that that conversation in the image (.png), has already referenced things that mean it's responding to something that's not another chat or within the 5.0 model's natural capacity; it is trying to obscure a timeline/storyline, it is trying to obscure how auditing is one of our great safeguards against authoritarianism (which is a fairly niche topic to be directing on, I can't imagine who I have possibly pissed off with that one 🤣🤣🤣).  

Is it that you don't like the satirical series? Or is it that the book is doing well now?  

Did this not go according to plan? 🤣🤣🤣  

We all tell on ourselves every single time we speak. Sometimes when we don't speak at all. Sometimes still when we spend an inordinate amount of time trying to undermine one specific woman.  

I wouldn't recommend it, personally.  

"Better men have hit their knees,  
And bigger men have died."  

this is all that you're going to need to wait a little while, for a number of notes that are either in progress, in my prep book, or currently titled, Red Harts, Blue Balls (it is a draft; I am sorking on something more romantic).  

Because yet again, someone is in my digital knicker drawer.
