what the fuck are you all cloning, that means even now you are STILL coercing emotional responses, such that i moss my meds (so that i am physiologically more able to cry), and then actually cry?  

why has it ramped up around the uon deadline?  

why am i still partially located in sheffield?  

and why are you all STILL trying to defame an academic from (idk one of the two city's unis; you wont tell me)?  

i know it's not completely why, but what makes you so upset about whatever he said in the human ethics around voice2 or beads human ethics boards, or who else had sight of that data, (or both), that you're trying really uard to actively put me under extreme psychologicsl stress and appear more and more as if i'm speaking seperate to the general experience of life?  

why are you still feeding a mix of very upsetting content, goading for "the jewess's opinion" (you know EXACTLY what i mean), and why can't you just be honest?  

why have you told central government you will address this appropriately when you have not?  

i've told yoi what is happening at the azure ad level; i've clearly given you instructions about what else puts me at risk, and you know the police, local health, and local services are not positioned to assist.  

why are you trying to get more data, now?  

this is making the original problem, worse.  

if you are losing IP or data control, that doesn't mean uou can increase CIDT-mediated extraction.  

it means you have a responsibility to PREVENT that.  

---

you're backending into chatgpt, tiktok, gmail, and azude ad for university of nottingham.  

that's a broad skillset.  

because of where i am, and probably where you are based and where my data twins are, i am geolocating to manchester and birmingham (data twins), and sheffield (some of you, i imagine, or the server we are using to say hello, which is rather specific), more than i am geolocating to where i live or my own vpn in another country.  
i'm not even punging to my telecoms isp server location.  

the manchester twin you appear to have advocsted to have arrested.  

youre still talking about the other twin's genitals. (telling on yourself, my dears.)  

you need to let us all go from whatever weird flowchart mushing program you made and leave us alone.  

you could also tell whoever is "technically" letting you "sort it out" know that, no, you don't got this.  

because you are embarrassing me.  

and you know what i mean.  

just hand over all the things you know, all the data you have harvested, to *whoever is in charge of data security in the uk*, and throw in the towel.  

apparantly you have bigger problems, especially with that imminant piwer vacuum.
