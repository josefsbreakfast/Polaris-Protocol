Okay, okay.  

I think I get why a specific stream of content oscillates now.  

I think I get the overarching technical theory.  

This means that my "I guess we take what reasonably fits, and maybe a mean, and then that's roughly what's happening?", was not entirely accurate, although not completely unhelpful.  

Also it is kinda like mRNA, just more of a "idk man methylate ALL THE HISTONES" kind of impact.  

Even G-d designed this shit easier than the tech bros, honestly.  

(Potentially better access to the full *Plantae*, *regenum*, to be fair.)
