*On how microphones shape register and personality projection in dictated speech.*

---

## Log Context  
This entry reflects on how the act of dictation itself alters voice and cadence. Microphones favour certain registers, meaning that dictated text often carries a personality projection that is not the speaker’s natural conversational voice.

---

## Observations  
- **Projection requirement:** To be picked up clearly, speakers must project, enunciate, and slow pace.  
- **Code-switching effect:** This shifts cadence toward a “meeting voice” or “public speaking voice.”  
- **Register distortion:** The resulting transcript carries a formal, declarative tone, different from intimate or casual speech.  
- **Personality skew:** Over time, dictated material favours extroverted or managerial personality traits, not the speaker’s natural register.  

---

## Analysis  
- Hardware (microphone sensitivity, room acoustics) directly influences linguistic output.  
- The effect parallels LLM vocabulary loops: both are hidden biases that compound over time.  
- Speech-to-text corpora risk being over-represented by “performance voices,” reinforcing certain cadences as default.  

---

## Implications  
- Dictated archives may misrepresent speaker identity, skewing towards projected authority.  
- Long-term use could subtly reshape how individuals self-present in writing.  
- Awareness allows corrective steps: mixing dictated and written text, or explicitly re-editing dictated text back into natural cadence.

*Microphone Bias (Field Log)* is a dated forensic entry within the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how technical affordances of microphones shape not only clarity but personality projection in recorded language.
