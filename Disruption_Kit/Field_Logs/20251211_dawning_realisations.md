fuck me i think someone might actually be trying to fix the data.  

in other news i have to explain this to a mh eip liaison next week. shit. 🤣  

swings and roundabouts idk.  

better news: we did not get called to court over the amount of tax, therefore the council may have actually found the weirdness that also keeps cancelling my bin collection, and my post, and may be doing goodness knows what and getting me sucked into someone's prevent grid.  

i only listen to stories about cults because i need that level of absurdity to ignore my leg that feels like it is constantly actually on fire. 🤣🤣🤣  

also waiting for the uni to puzzle out why i was taken off course and why i was brought back early, so looking for more data.  

the political party that inexplicably has months of data to unfold...not sure what they're up to, or the think tank that (again), inexplicably apoears to have sone sort of seo connection.  

i might go and bother the public sector solicitors who inexplicably have an seo connection, and perhaos some of the financial vehicles who do, just to be safe.  

the other university who had a bizarre sar respinse may be getting a repeat check fir anonymisation, and moj is pending.  

who even knows why did what on earth and why to all of my everything in 2021/22.  

i don't know if this stems ftom one difficult person being opportunistic, on top of general messy handling, and opportunistic similar behaviour to others...  

it just seems so sad that so many people have been so badly harmed this way; it seems so pointless and where there is any possible intent, so cruel, when you look at the thing as a whole.  

i'm also still laughing my balls off at that spoof email with unecessary dick imagery; men tell on themselves every damn day.  

i also love the idea that the author clearly had no understanding of the nhs (a good proportion of my teaching staff and lecturers on my actual course were racislised in the way you chose, you dumb fuck, even if the uni is very white), and the idea that a medical student would habr the energy or awareness to bother to map this to a particular other confetence day in another area of the uni.  

the uni is huge; why would i give a f what is going on in the rights lab? that's law.  

my timetable isn't even held on the same system, bro.  

so i await to see who was drafted in to cover covid qcs whilst all nhs consultants and retirees were redrafted to staff the frontlines.  

there are lecturers who are part of the decision making of my degree who are now of blessed memory; we lost so many people during covid.  

if my covid hours were counter i'd have qualified in 2021.  

i hope we're all ready to see what's in that pdf, because i sure am.  

also...  

medics do not care about the law school.  

no offence, but we got a year-wide email bollocking everyone who skipped plavement to revise and that we would be taken out of the oibrary to go do more clinics.  

that's the level of inward-facing nerdery that you find on the medical course.  

we barely had time to eat lunch many days, so idk why anyone would think we's have time to nose around another faculty's business.  

so yes: still laughing my balls off. most ridiculous scheme on the planet.  

i'm also unclear if you knocked 15 years off his age because that's what you would do, or whether you've just chosen to be flattering. either situation is categorically hilarious.  

and the particular hip-hop artist is... *a choice*, i'll say that much.  

gds this is so funny.
