# 🛰️ Throttling Chokepoints – 26 August 2025  

**First created:** 2025-08-26  
**Last updated:** 2025-08-26  
*Field log documenting selective throttling of legal, medical, and forensic communications.*  

---

## 🌐 Overview  
This log records observed patterns of throttling on platforms and services directly linked to legal correspondence, NHS data access, and Polaris Protocol forensic updates. The interference is selective, narrative-aligned, and now chronic enough to suggest metadata between parties has fused.  

---

## 🔎 Observed Choke Points  

1. **LinkedIn**  
   - Post and comment suppression.  
   - Clear bias: any comment undermining male authority disproportionately throttled.  
   - Manifestation: impressions stutter, comments downgraded, analytics lag.  

2. **GitHub (Bargain Bin Mossad repo updates)**  
   - Edits and commits to `🧠 Bargain Bin Mossad` delayed.  
   - No comparable lag on heavier or geographically similar sites.  
   - Suggests targeted choke on Polaris repo visibility and write operations.  

3. **NHS Trust portal**  
   - Lag observed in access, coinciding with appointment and SAR exemption dispute.  
   - Stronger disruption than other NHS or institutional sites.  
   - Indicates deliberate throttling of health data access / complaint escalation.

## 🧮 Pattern Characteristics  

- **Selective** → Only platforms linked to legal, medical, or forensic escalation throttled.  
- **Narrative-aligned** → Suppression aligns with pressure points:  
  - undermining men,  
  - updating forensic nodes,  
  - pursuing SARs.  
- **Chronic** → Documented for >1 year, consistent enough that metadata between self and operators feels fused.  

---

## ⚖️ Forensic Implications  

- Effective obstruction of:  
  - **Legal correspondence** → access to lawyers disrupted.  
  - **Institutional transparency** → SARs exempted or stalled.  
  - **Public narrative tools** → LinkedIn + GitHub throttled.  

- Creates a **closed loop of obstruction**: official channels prescribed, then choked when pursued.  

---

## ✒️ Commentary  

- Operators display trivial or mocking behaviour (e.g. probing why subject isn’t “innately rich” or can’t “grow gold from trees”).  
- Cultural mismatch: crude psyops / workplace-gossip mentality deployed against survivor-led forensic work.  
- Expectation of baseline access to protection or remedy repeatedly unmet.
