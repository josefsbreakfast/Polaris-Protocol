# 🛰️ Throttling Chokepoints (26 August 2025)

**First created:** 2025-08-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-01

*Field log documenting selective throttling of legal, medical, and forensic communications.*  

---

## 🌐 Overview  

This log records observed patterns of throttling on platforms and services directly linked to legal correspondence, NHS data access, and Polaris Protocol forensic updates.  
The interference is selective, narrative-aligned, and now chronic enough to suggest metadata between parties has fused.  

---

## 🔎 Observed Chokepoints  

1. **LinkedIn**  
   - Post and comment suppression.  
   - Clear bias: any comment undermining male authority disproportionately throttled.  
   - Manifestation: impressions stutter, comments downgraded, analytics lag.  

2. **GitHub (Bargain Bin Mossad repo updates)**  
   - Edits and commits to `🧠 Bargain Bin Mossad` delayed.  
   - No comparable lag on heavier or geographically similar sites.  
   - Suggests targeted choke on Polaris repo visibility and write operations.  

3. **NHS Trust Portal**  
   - Lag observed in access, coinciding with appointment and SAR exemption dispute.  
   - Stronger disruption than other NHS or institutional sites.  
   - Indicates deliberate throttling of health data access / complaint escalation.

## 🧮 Pattern Characteristics  

- **Selective** → Only platforms linked to legal, medical, or forensic escalation throttled.  
- **Narrative-aligned** → Suppression aligns with pressure points:  
  - undermining men,  
  - updating forensic nodes,  
  - pursuing SARs.  
- **Chronic** → Documented for >1 year, consistent enough that metadata between self and operators feels fused.  

---

## ⚖️ Forensic Implications  

- Effective obstruction of:  
  - **Legal correspondence** → access to lawyers disrupted.  
  - **Institutional transparency** → SARs exempted or stalled.  
  - **Public narrative tools** → LinkedIn + GitHub throttled.  

- Creates a **closed loop of obstruction**: official channels prescribed, then choked when pursued.  

---

## ✒️ Commentary  

- Operators display trivial or mocking behaviour (e.g. probing why subject isn’t “innately rich” or can’t “grow gold from trees”).  
- Cultural mismatch: crude psyops / workplace-gossip mentality deployed against survivor-led forensic work.  
- Expectation of baseline access to protection or remedy repeatedly unmet.

## 🧾 Satirical Aside  

Yes, it’s funny that Steve-O’s ego earned its own Polaris node.  
Yes, it looks like Del Boy AI running on a WiFi jammer from the back of a van.  

But beneath the slapstick is coercive control:  
- Selective throttling cuts survivors and dissidents off from **exactly** the most vital systems — legal recourse, healthcare, forensic publishing.  
- That makes the “lag” more than an irritation; it’s a form of governance.  
- **Humour covers danger**: being denied confidential healthcare, safe legal access, or the ability to publish unthrottled isn’t about drama. It’s structural coercion.  

---

## ⚖️ Why This Matters  

- Other people are experiencing this pattern too.  
- It operates most severely where it hurts most: cutting the lines to doctors, lawyers, and networks of care.  
- To dismiss this as “dramatic” or to tell people to “pull their socks up” erases the real risk.  
- The international attention these posts receive from industries most exposed to risk shows: this isn’t just personal inconvenience — it’s a systemic hazard.

👉 Friday night jokes about poop aside, survivors deserve healthcare that’s private, legal access that’s intact, and networks that don’t collapse under the weight of someone else’s fragile ego.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Throttling Chokepoints (26 August 2025)* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records selective throttling targeting legal, medical, and forensic systems, and situates the behaviour as coercive control through infrastructure-level obstruction.
