# 🛰️ Polaris Protocol – Field Logs  
**Location:** `Disruption_Kit/Field_Logs`  
_Last updated: 2025-08-11_

## 📌 Overview  
**Field Logs** are time-bound, event-specific forensic captures.  
They record suppression behaviours, metadata anomalies, and live operational breaches as they happen.  
Entries often include screenshots, timestamps, and immediate interpretive notes.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **ICC Tag Thread Containment** and **Forensic Thread Analysis** capture the same event from different angles (narrative vs. metrics).  
- **Echo Return** identifies when content breaches its engineered perimeter.  
- **Metadata Twitching** logs platform countermeasures after initial breach events.
