## 📌 Overview  
**Field Logs** are live-scenario records capturing suppression patterns, containment breaches, and real-time platform behaviours as they happen.  
These entries prioritise immediacy and precision — documenting *when*, *where*, and *how* narrative control attempts occur.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **ICC Tag Thread Containment** anchors suppression analysis tied to international legal tagging.  
- **Echo Return** flags the moment narrative breaches its engineered perimeter.  
- **Forensic Thread Analysis** and **Metadata Twitching** deepen the real-time capture of interference behaviours.  
- Together, they form a **visibility breach chain** for correlating platform and institutional responses.
