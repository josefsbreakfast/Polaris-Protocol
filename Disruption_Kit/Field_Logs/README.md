# 🛰️ Polaris Protocol – Field Logs  
**Location:** `Disruption_Kit/Field_Logs`  
_Last updated: 2025-08-11_

## 📌 Overview  
**Field Logs** are time-bound, event-specific forensic captures.  
They record suppression behaviours, metadata anomalies, and live operational breaches as they happen.  
Entries often include screenshots, timestamps, and immediate interpretive notes.

### [`🛰️ ICC Tag Thread Containment`](./🛰️_icc_tag_thread_containment.md)  
Detailed log of an ICC/ICJ-tagged LinkedIn reply sequence that triggered systemic stutter: throttling, delayed impressions, interface disruption, and perceptual containment.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **ICC Tag Thread Containment**, **Loft Packet Dump Theory**, and **Forensic Thread Analysis** are part of a connected suppression and contamination sequence.  
- **Echo Return** identifies when content breaches its engineered perimeter.  
- **Metadata Twitching** logs platform countermeasures after initial breach events.
