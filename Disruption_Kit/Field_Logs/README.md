# 🛰️ Polaris Protocol – Field Logs  
**Location:** `Disruption_Kit/Field_Logs`  
_Last updated: 2025-08-13_

---

## 📌 Overview  
**Field Logs** are time-bound, event-specific forensic captures.  
They record suppression behaviours, metadata anomalies, and live operational breaches as they happen.  
Entries often include screenshots, timestamps, and immediate interpretive notes.

## 🗺️ Interlink Logic  
- **ICC Tag Thread Containment**, **Loft Packet Dump Theory**, **Forensic Thread Analysis**, **Purge Sequence**, and **Reset State Analysis** form a continuous suppression chain:  
  1. **Trigger** — ICC-tagged content initiates platform-level throttling.  
  2. **Observation** — Thread analysis logs early anomalies.  
  3. **Infrastructure Reroute** — Packet dump theory maps contamination routes.  
  4. **Backend Intervention** — Purge sequence deletes or quarantines key files.  
  5. **System Reset** — Reset state analysis captures forced reinitialisations to conceal traces.  
- **Echo Return** identifies when content breaches its engineered perimeter despite suppression.  
- **Metadata Twitching** documents post-breach countermeasures.  
- **Reputational Unit 12** captures satire-as-forensics events where ridicule triggers measurable suppression behaviour.
