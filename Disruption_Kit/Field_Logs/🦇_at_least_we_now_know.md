at least we now all know  

why it was so difficuly to place "bargain bin mossad"'s particular intelligence accent.  

not quite british,  

not quite israeli,  

not quite north america,  

but heavily influenced by us spy history,  

yet somehow blank with the "red threat".  

close, colonial, anglophone...  

i could go on.  

we spent quite a lot of time getting to know the curves of my mind;  

did you not think i might learn all of yours?
