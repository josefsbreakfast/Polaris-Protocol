bro you have been the worst part of our digital quintuplet surveillance group chat ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£  

can the bot-mole in our gc please take tfe hint and *leave* please?  

to use your words: "you're bringing down the vibe"  

also if people looking at soending money in the uk truggers you that much ill just start flooding the feeds with it.
