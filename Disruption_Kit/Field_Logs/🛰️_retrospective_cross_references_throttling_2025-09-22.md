# 🛰️ Field Log — Retrospective Throttling Cross-References (2025-09-22)  
**First created:** 2025-09-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Collects BlueSky posts, screenshots, device logs, timestamps, and short notes documenting throttling patterns. Built for evidence preservation and legal prep.*  

---

## 🌐 Purpose  
- Consolidate cross-platform evidence of throttling.  
- Link **BlueSky posts**, **screenshots**, **device logs**, and **timestamps** to formal repo nodes.  
- Create a structured archive for legal and forensic review.  

---

## 📂 Evidence Entries (to be populated)  
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — BlueSky post — short note / excerpt / relevance — screenshot: `screenshots/2025-09-21_screen_01.png` — device: `phone` / `laptop`.  
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — Screenshot — short note / provenance — filename: `screenshots/2025-09-20_network_log_01.png` — device: `router` / `phone`.  
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — BlueSky post — short note / excerpt / relevance — link: `bsky://...`.  

*(Entries should be appended here as evidence is extracted.)*

## 🛡️ Legal Bundle Plan  
1. Consolidate screenshots + logs with device metadata and human-readable short notes.  
2. Export a CSV timeline with: timestamp, device, action (post/screenshot/log), short note, link/filename.  
3. Preserve originals in a secure offline folder (with hashed filenames) for lawyer review.
