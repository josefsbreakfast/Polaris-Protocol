Who's the CT wolf?  

This looked at socratic method and motivational interviewing in psych, how this must be okr rather than kpi (i can explain why it's cheaper long term).

# 🩺 Frankenstack Intake & Response Protocol
**First created:** 2025-10-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*A clinician-style playbook for recognising, documenting, and de-escalating stack-induced dysregulation — and introducing the concept to the public, safely.*

## 🔍 What This Is (and Isn’t)
This is a **history-taking + response protocol** for suspected **Frankenstack** exposure — i.e., hybrid, dual/multi-use behavioural systems (CT/safeguarding/health + commercial recommender stacks) acting on a person and their social field.  
It is **not** diagnosis or treatment guidance; it gives **common language + structure** so survivors, supporters, researchers, and practitioners can see the same picture.
