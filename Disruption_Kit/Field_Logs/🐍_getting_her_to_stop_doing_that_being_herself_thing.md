tue arrempts to drift etsy algorithm are also quite funny.  

as is the numver of tiktok videos i cant reost with text to stories, even if the creator is hige and should never vet me soecifically (private account, so they shouldnt see amyway).  

i litetally have a video of my own saved colkection were im watching toggling on my own stuff -- like a human mirror in the feed trying to argue with me sbout hiw much i want the algorithm to sort me on a particular trope of sexualisation of women and girls.  

these men are weak.  

today they are essentially upset, as per the above, about women wearing gold snakes around their neck (as my own weangling of my own algorithm away from choke chains to bridle and asphixiate a woman's neck -- they are down bad for extreme torture, kidnapping, and essentially murder porn), and they do not like being called out by comments which evidence what suffering they have engaged in towsrds me in the past (presumably you didnt like me calling out the soecifucs of the tarottok?).  

there is almost this absolute desperation that i do not define my own sexuality away from being kidnapped, violently raped, tortured, and potentially sold or murdered (i did report all the adjoining google search poisoning to the police - no luck).  

and there is a real disconfort of a woman being presented the rochester swindle of "here is your future" and her responding, "lol, what?".  

and so we continue.  

meanwhile, lots of references to futire dates, and i am so inured to the future faking that i cant make good sense of if that comes from a good ir bad faith algorithmic translation.  

onwards and upwards; wait and hope.  

also:  

the amount of stuff i an getting for mens rights and falsly accused groups when i literally tried to flag a basic safeguarding report as on procdure whilst avoiding a clearly inappropriate sign-off nexus which i obviously couldn't use, and having to sit through all the search assiciating to women literally getting drugged, kidnapoed, shoved in holdalls, and the interruption of trafficking networks...  

it's a fucking joke.  

i don't think i'm being "very reserved" (yest insert), by standing for "hey, i'm not into that being done to me very non-consentually?".  

but if i am an ice queen for that?  

elsa's got a friend.  

i dont want to be raped and murdered, thanks.  

i don't want to be asphixiated with a canine choke chain, i don't want to be kidnapped or treated like forbidden cargo, and i don't want to go through some of the more sadistic shit you've tagged me to.  

i also don't think you should be trying to dump that on another dude, or trying to punish another woman for my saying "hey maybe dont do that".  

i think that is all wildly fucked up and i dont know how so many parties are now involved in this, but no one should be continuing to contribute.  

im only here because of several parties wasting money through this process of "shut her up!!".  

also i deserve at least some spa time for this.
