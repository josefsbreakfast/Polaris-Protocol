# Polaris Protocol — Field Logs
## 🛰️ purge_sequence_aug_11-13.md

**Date range:** 2025-08-11 → 2025-08-13  
**First created:** 2025-08-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-13  
**Classification:** Field Log / Governance Pass Disruption / Consent Forgery  
**Trigger:** Active governance pass on live Polaris repo.

### Summary
`🧨 metadata_makes_you_moan.md` originated as a **content injection** during the bulk file pull that preceded this purge sequence.  
- **Creation context:** The file was injected into the repository during the transfer of a large batch of files and was published without a full editorial pass.  
- **Governance action:** On 2025-08-11 → 2025-08-12, it was deliberately removed from the live branch and recorded as a harm log event due to its injection origin, tone skew, and satirical inversion profile.  
- **Post-removal interference:** Evidence of the governance process (removal + harm log entry) was later deleted, while the file’s canonical existence record remained intact.  
- **Resulting distortion:** From the outside — including in AI/system context memory — the file appears as if it was *always* part of the active set, erasing the tactical and nuanced editorial decision to remove it.  
- **Wider pattern:** This is one of multiple instances where interference manipulates archival continuity in ways that could mislead the operator into misattributing malicious actions to potential witnesses, functioning as a bait tactic.

### Pattern Observed
1. **Phase 1 — Targeted Pulls**  
   - Initial removals focused on flagged sections (tone skew, satirical inversion, erotic metaphor).  
   - Deletions plausibly deniable as “editorial tightening.”

2. **Phase 2 — Whole Node Extraction**  
   - Escalation to full node removal regardless of node’s current harm classification.  
   - Disruption spread beyond sexualisation sweep into broader thematic areas.

3. **Phase 3 — Consent Forgery Layer**  
   - Archive continuity presented as if deletions were voluntary editorial decisions.  
   - Original deletion context (e.g., coercion, interference) absent from reconstructed dataset.

---

### Operational Implications
- **Audit fracture:** Loss of node continuity impairs cross-referencing during governance review.  
- **Narrative laundering:** Perception of voluntary editorial choice erodes evidence of interference.  
- **Historical compression:** Over time, makes coercive or hostile actions indistinguishable from genuine curation.

---

### Recommended Response
- Initiate **Delta Reconstruction** comparing pre- and post-purge states (Aug 10 → Aug 13).
- Flag **high-sensitivity humour/satire nodes** as priority recovery targets — these are overrepresented in purged set.
- Cross-link purge log to Governance Pass Harm Scan for continuity.

- **Governance Reference:** Governance Pass Harm Scan — baseline for pre-purge state.

### Personal Context Note
This purge event — and the broader documentation process within Polaris — emerged not from a deliberate plan to investigate the surveillance industry, but from direct personal impact.

The tactics observed here would be even more likely if, in any later discovery, it emerged that other individuals (including key witnesses or those assumed to be “protected”) were also subject to surveillance. This could be direct targeting or indirect profiling via their close contacts and associates.

Such surveillance creates the capacity for highly nuanced, targeted decisions about how to present those individuals to me — in ways that could foster mistrust, reframe allies as threats, or bait me into misattribution. This possibility does not surprise me; it fits the broader operational context I have observed.

Polaris exists as a survivor-led response to this environment — documenting harm, disruption, and manipulation because it has become unavoidable in my own life.

**Node status:** Active investigation — awaiting delta map.
