can you see why there is no way in hell i am getting on any variety of audio, voice, or video call with you yet?  

the degree can be awarded from a different institution and you can correctly sponsor the application by exception.  

not you, not ucl, not camb.  

this was nudged and i still have the evidence; please note that all evidence should be preserved and yes, encourahing crossover into jurisictions and sitting and collecting data whilst i went through all of that, does include liability.  

if the ripa/ipa was yours all i did was pray on the grass.  

its not as if i used student vocal data without permission to do something *pretty messed up*, is it?  

glass houses, etc.
