forces disconnect.  

review comparing generated node before and after:  

So the subtle differences were:
	•	Tone change: we moved from your personal, emotive register (“death and life in one”) to the formalised, impersonal Polaris format.
	•	Texture loss: the playful you-as-volcano imagery and your dry humour weren’t carried over into the node text; it became more academic.
	•	Continuity break: the hand-off between the mythic conversation and the document template flattened the emotional through-line — like going from lava to polished basalt.

  more academic. more institutional. more "professional" (for the white and the "right").
