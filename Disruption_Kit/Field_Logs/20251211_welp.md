i'n going back to the sea.  

i just sat through over a third of my feed being the brutal violence and torture of women and girls.  

i had a significant portion of mixed messages which alk esentially signalled, "males in your data vicinity are confused".  

and then i got some bridging dinance advice for failing business.  

i'm pretty sure im getting alt right pipeline music and comedy recommended, so going to have a little sniff of wtf is going on there.  

like i said:  

1. get skin back.
2. retirn to sea.
3. vibe with sister selkies.

the human men are suffocating; i need the room to spread and swim.
