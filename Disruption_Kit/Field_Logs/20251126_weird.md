I'm quite unwell.  

The internet is incredibly stange; apparantly I have to listen tp heartbreak speeches on my own wifi.  

The reason I cant face looking at security, is because I just cannot cope with the possibilities afterward.

i basically don't have finctional internet. ill load some screenshpts later. not purely reactive along political lines, but not completely unrelated.  

theres a plethora of recommends into feed that suggest at least a ghost or some attempt to redirect focus from infprmayion flows in institution.  

the started after an email from an ngo, then volume all the way yp when i tried to address the frankenstack in magistrates court summons.  

amazing that still the moj is like "what sealed documents 🥺" but ive been asked to justify neuropathy several times and weve taken a medical degree away and hollowed me out for high-cost data, but we're still at the "is this.... a safeguarding..?" level, if at all.  

im not coming for anyone specific right now im just extremely sore, incredibly angry, tired, and not 100% on what the future looks like.
