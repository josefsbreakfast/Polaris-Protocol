added 'Disruption_Kit/Field_Logs/🐣_fast_forward_1_day_despite_correct_entry.jpg' as example.  

Today is the 22nd, and I added the correct date to the information that built this piece of code.  

Despite this the day the 23rd was generated.  

This suggests that wherever the information is going to be at least an hour ahead. It is not possible that this is VPN related this time. This is not related to BST.  

This error is intermittent. It shows at most, at times when Microsoft servers are also being accessed and my emails are failing validation on Microsoft servers.  

A little food for thought.  

The error is what it is and is reasonably easy to overcome with extra checks; it is more useful as a diagnostic indication as to where information is travelling, or precisely where our middleware may be located.  

Or: who has device-level access?  

Again, I obviously have no idea who that could be. I am merely reporting what I am seeing. my tiny little girl brain cannot possibly have any ideas whatsoever. 🤣🤣🤣
