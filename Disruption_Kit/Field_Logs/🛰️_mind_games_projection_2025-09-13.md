# 🛰️ Mind Games Projection — Feed Insertion Log  
**First created:** 2025-09-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-13  
*Field note capturing musical projection artifact tied to diagnostic overlays and national atmosphere*  

---

## Event Trace  
- **Artifact:** Track “Mind Games” (Sickick) surfaced in survivor feed.  
- **Time context:** Same day as London march of UK nationalism (far-right overtones).  
- **Immediate effect:** Projection of “control” felt as unwelcome — linked to coercive national climate.  

---

## Observations  
- Lyrical content: insistence on control/possession, repeated refrains, cosplay bravado.  
- Function: less menace than confession — **leakage of adversary fixation**.  
- Diagnostic echo: while not confirmed as a Prevent concern, projection aligns with **diagnostic potentials** that could be rehearsed into mental health appointments soon after.  

---

## Overlay Dynamics  
Projection carried through a **composite overlay**:  
- White supremacy  
- Paternalist scripting  
- Recurrent motifs of **Welsh national pride** (not coherent politics, but invoked symbolically)  
- Prominent when nudges occur re: work in a **specific border-village context** (poorly connected but repeatedly flagged).  

Overlay resonates with far-right atmosphere in London, amplifying coercive undertones.

## Forensic Classification
