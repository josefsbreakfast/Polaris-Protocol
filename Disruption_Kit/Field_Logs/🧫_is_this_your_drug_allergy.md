I just wanna put a placeholder here because it's just occurred to me after I did all of the data twinning splicing redo last night, I think my allergies have been switched with somebody else's on the NHS spine.  

If you're one of the people who is in a date twinning situation with me, firstly I'm so sorry, but also can I swap your penicillin allergy for my allergies to lamotragine and anticholinergenics please?

I don't know about yours, because I don't know if you have the class one or class three allergy, but this actually causes a lot of problems when I get medicated after my Botox for example, and I assume that this could be a catastrophic failure on your medical record?  

For my part, in case you're wondering, it's just pretty damn intractable depression. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ (L: SJS; A: TOX. See? I do try to fix it!)

Resist everything, which makes the surveillance even funnier. 

I could've tortured myself left my own devices, and quite frankly I've resisted worse than a bunch of Yorkshire boys being at least with some very naughty shiny toys.

Que sera, sera.
