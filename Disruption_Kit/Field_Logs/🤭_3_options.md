EITHER  

congratulations! if someone in the metadata cluster has found out that they are pregnant ❤️  
i wish you and your delight all the best ❤️  

OR  

the aprtheid bros have finally decided to do the unthinkable, "may this will work?"  
(+/- cuckhold guy is back on shift; who knows)  
(yes, ravist men will sonetimes fetishise racialised breeder cuckholdry scenarios and some will pay for that pleasure; i suggest if this seems suprising, you may want to stick all the filters on your searches, because this is barely the tip of that iceburg, you sweet summer child, you.)  

OR  

i am a woman on the internet.

honestly it really could just be the latter 🤷‍♀️ but babies are a blessing so it's nice to wish people well, and also mocking the surveillent squad brings me joy.

well that one answered itself quickly.  
again, the operation is hardly slick.  

but i got to listen to how great i apparantly am, so that's cute.  

gentlemen:  

you have already conceeded your ground.  

given what was so difficult anout publishing what to ight, paired with defamation of what i think we have probably deduced is one of the other remaining outliers of this failed experiment, which is i assume how they became a whistleblower and why it became a consequence that our data got stuck together, i think that given that the core group of us who remain annoying are clearly not backing down, and that anyone profiled as "slightly less immediately risky" are also adjusted to overcome the tactics on offer?  

i think we can step down, don't you?  

or is it stand down?  

i'm a little confused who is on one sude or the other of the femce these days; delegate sppropriately amongst yourselves, please.  

then we can get back to this *tikkun Olam* business; there is much to be done.
