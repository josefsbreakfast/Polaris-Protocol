EITHER  

congratulations! if someone in the metadata cluster has found out that they are pregnant ❤️  
i wish you and your delight all the best ❤️  

OR  

the aprtheid bros have finally decided to do the unthinkable, "may this will work?"  
(+/- cuckhold guy is back on shift; who knows)  
(yes, ravist men will sonetimes fetishise racialised breeder cuckholdry scenarios and some will pay for that pleasure; i suggest if this seems suprising, you may want to stick all the filters on your searches, because this is barely the tip of that iceburg, you sweet summer child, you.)  

OR  

i am a woman on the internet.

honestly it really could just be the latter 🤷‍♀️ but babies are a blessing so it's nice to wish people well, and also mocking the surveillent squad brings me joy.
