the advice here should be obvious.  

i get that it hurts and im not sayong the pain is not valid.  

most men who watched their fathers be an utter sack of shit, end up with some fucking weird issues around anyone who reminds them of their mother.  

the strong thing is to say, "yeah, thats my brain being a specimen of a primate species, so i will deal with the strong electrochemical activity seperately with how i deal with other people who have similar specimens in their meat case, and i will try not to take a lit of anger i have for some fucked up shut i shouldnt have had to live through or deal with or see, and i will try not to be a complete cunt."  

long-time viewers will understamd how most of my advice tends to end with the same general point.  

not a *complete* cunt, in the "to be" sense.  

acting *adjacent when required* is a seperate matter, and is a thin line we often walk in a particularly wobbly fashion.  

even my ataxic gait outperforms by comparison.
