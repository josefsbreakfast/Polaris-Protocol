being a jewish woman,  
and why i am tired of the men who watch me like a freak show in a box.

zionism is racist, including towards jews,  
and i don't want it for my children.

why using a background of potentially illegal surveillance-derived data,  
in order to pray on the fertility anxiety of a 35 year old woman,  
who you routinly interfere in the social connections of such that she loses the chance to marry,  
the chance to *make said children*,  
or even have the very human need of caring physical contact met,  
(after all, you appear to have interfered with her last partner's chemo to time ot with her arrest and detention, and collide this all over a paleatinian-israeli ngo's levture series --  
a moment of memorial and silent prayer for the death of subtlety),  
is in slightly poor taste.

why authoritarian power, fascisms, and illegal and violent military occupations seek to control women's bodies,  
how misogynistic and patriarchal violence seeks to contain the feminine body,  
and ultimately how this comes from the fear and inadequacy experienced,  
by men who cannot give breath to new life,  
without a woman.  

and because they view us with such derision and malice,  
and because they still desire progeny,  
and because they are obsessed with dna retention in gascist states:  

why we should be deeply concerned about what these men want to do,  
precisely,  
in uncomfortable detail,  
with the potential outcomes possible in robotics and engineering.  

because they will only want to control us more,  
if they create an even more polarised supply-and-demand issue,  
without addressing their own emotionality.  

such that it will always,
always,  
always,  
end up being most violent to women,  
the worst to those of us most marginalised,  
but spread brutally and completely enough to all of us,  
that we need to stop them now.  

this is all to say,  
that knowing that i am coming to terms with the dgree of interpersonal interference,  
and algorithmically allowing guilt-content to spawn on my feed,  
pressuring me to "stop being me",  
because that is your reason for my non-marriage?  

you are the reason that i am unable to socialise,  
unable to meet others,  
unable to marry.  

so in the name of our ancestors who were martyred in warsaw,  
who fought from tunnels,  
like the ones being filled with concerte to bury foghters alive in gaza,  
(idgaf which faction they're in -- i give every fick about the act of burying people alive, though),  
in the name of our ancestors in the vilnus forests,  
and in the name of every nazi trick they took down,  
every supply line they sabotaged,  
and in the name of each and every one of the righteous oyim of europe,  
goyim or yoyim,  
who fucked that occupation until it broke apart:  

i know who i am.  
and that is why:  
you cannot break me.  

does not every child deserve security;  
all the way from the jordan river,  
to the mediterranean sea?  

i am not the self-hating jew;  
i am a daughter of judah,  
raised of lions,  
courage swelled in my heart,  
i ride on the wings of peace,  
and like father noah's dove,  
i call out for safety amongst the waves.  


i know who i am.  
i know who made me.  
no one, save the creater/maintainer/destroyer,  
will ever break me.
