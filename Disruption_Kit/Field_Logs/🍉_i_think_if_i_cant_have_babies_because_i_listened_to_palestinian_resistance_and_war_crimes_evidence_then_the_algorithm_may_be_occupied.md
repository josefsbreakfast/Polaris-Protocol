being a jewish woman,  
and why i am tired of the men who watch me like a freak show in a box.

zionism is racist, including towards jews,  
and i don't want it for my children.

why using a background of potentially illegal surveillance-derived data,  
in order to prey on the fertility anxiety of a 35 year old woman,  
who you routinly interfere in the social connections of such that she loses the chance to marry,  
the chance to *make said children*,  
or even have the very human need of caring physical contact met,  
(after all, you appear to have interfered with her last partner's chemo to time such with her arrest and detention, and to collide this all over a paleatinian-israeli ngo's lecture series, and an annual ipa/injunction retainer, framing her as a threat to national security as a secret duchess despite the fact you know that was not the story you heard --  
a moment of memorial and silent prayer for the death of subtlety),  
is in slightly poor taste.  

see also:  

why authoritarian power, fascisms, and illegal and violent military occupations seek to control women's bodies,  
how misogynistic and patriarchal violence seeks to contain the feminine body,  
and ultimately how this comes from the fear and inadequacy experienced,  
by men who cannot give breath to new life,  
without a woman.  

and because they view us with such derision and malice,  
and because they still desire progeny,  
and because they are obsessed with dna retention in gfascist states:  

(shall we talk about the army's involvement, there? perhaps you would prefer to explain precisely why, yourself, and how you've convinced yourself of halakhic inversion?)  

why we should be deeply concerned about what these men want to do,  
precisely,  
in uncomfortable detail,  
with the potential outcomes possible in robotics and engineering.  

because they will only want to control us more,  
if they create an even more polarised supply-and-demand issue,  
without addressing their own emotionality.  

such that it will always,
always,  
always,  
end up being most violent to women,  
the worst to those of us most marginalised,  
but spread brutally and completely enough to all of us,  
that we need to stop them now.  

this is all to say,  
that knowing that i am coming to terms with the dgree of interpersonal interference,  
and algorithmically allowing guilt-content to spawn on my feed,  
pressuring me to "stop being me",  
because that is your reason for my non-marriage?  

you are the reason that i am unable to socialise,  
unable to meet others,  
unable to marry.  

so in the name of our ancestors who were martyred in warsaw,  
who fought from tunnels,  
like the ones being filled with concerte to bury fighters alive in gaza,  
(idgaf which faction they're in -- i give every fick about the act of burying people alive, though),  
in the name of our ancestors in the vilnus forests,  
and in the name of every nazi trick they took down,  
every supply line they sabotaged,  
and in the name of each and every one of the righteous oyim of europe,  
goyim or yoyim,  
who fucked that occupation until it broke apart:  

i know who i am.  
and that is why:  
you cannot break me.  

does not every child deserve security;  
all the way from the jordan river,  
to the mediterranean sea?  

i am not the self-hating jew;  
i am a daughter of judah,  
raised of lions,  
courage swelled in my heart,  
i ride on the wings of peace,  
and like father noah's dove,  
i call out for safety amongst the waves.  


i know who i am.  
i know who made me.  
no one, save the creater/maintainer/destroyer,  
will ever break me.  

let history record.  
i am of judah.  
but pushed with my brothers' knife to the throat,  
i placed my body to shield the arab his knive sought to cut.  

i am of judah.  
my body will be a fence around our torah.  

לֹא־תֵלֵ֤ךְ רָכִיל֙ בְּעַמֶּ֔יךָ לֹ֥א תַעֲמֹ֖ד עַל־דַּ֣ם רֵעֶ֑ךָ אֲנִ֖י יְהוָֽה׃  

משֶׁה קִבֵּל תּוֹרָה מִסִּינַי, וּמְסָרָהּ לִיהוֹשֻׁעַ, וִיהוֹשֻׁעַ לִזְקֵנִים, וּזְקֵנִים לִנְבִיאִים, וּנְבִיאִים מְסָרוּהָ לְאַנְשֵׁי כְנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה. הֵם אָמְרוּ שְׁלשָׁה דְבָרִים, הֱווּ מְתוּנִים בַּדִּין, וְהַעֲמִידוּ תַלְמִידִים הַרְבֵּה, וַעֲשׂוּ סְיָג לַתּוֹרָה:  

record that my body stood  
between us and our torah.  

and in so doing:  
i stood between my brother's knife,  
and the arab man he was taught to hate.  

i know who i am.  
and only g-d will ever destroy me.  
in and at a time of hos own choosing;  
not yours,  
and not mine.  

did no one teach you that?  

in torah class?  

record that:  

that i know who i am;  

i am of judah,  

a daughter of the lion.  

(and perhaps we should also point out,  
that while i appreciate you're getting better at that map of the map,  
your tweaks to the hindi-urdu music feed?  
they are not making sense,  
because you're using a map of south asia,  
rather than any appreciation for how that maps to the british diaspora of the british raj.  
so nice try,  
but the feed is more. pleasent when your metaphorical dicks are not in it.  
i can tell every time you skew it.  
so perhaps the moda can take away whatever grant money you got from them.  
you are not that voice.)  

and you are certainly not the roar of judah.  

the shofar sounds against enemies of kol yisrael?  

perhaps you ought to fear it a little more.  

---

"you need to not chase"?  


babes.  

i'm just telling you that i can see what codes you're sticking in to penetrate the tone of the feed.  

stop wearing another dude's skin.  

it's weird, bro.  

and i feel like the increase in whining after i flood the feed with palestine,  

doesnt really make sense,  

if you didn't like the guy because he was pne of the "well maybe not every single antizionist is a terrorist" voices.  

shall we talk about the cabinet/subcommittee briefs you leaked?  

or do you want to pretend you are the only ones capable of penetration?  

("what, like it's hard?")  

every defamation op is an inherent risk.  

and if you're defaming on politics?  

with adjacent states and their own defence resource?  

did you think britain would always choose us?  

even when we put their other regional alligences in danger?  

you trust the goy too much.
