i have a cracking headache with aura and cant get out to mh team.  

direct result of dealing with data disruption amd coercive control (s76, serious crime act).  

i have reported the coercive control to police several times without action; my reports are all secondary to the safeguarding report i made on same individual. therefore i should never have been classed as the "original" perpetrator.  

directly requesyed ico 72hrs call and siro asap flag.  

prev disclosures reveal potentially sensitive business partnerships, unwillingness to discuss sal/commercial, biometric data, and anything outsode of direct academic record.  

direct academic record is incomplete, contains direct disability diacrimination by staff, and includes direct belittling as rape victim in justice system; record reveals twin/split record by its disclosure; dpa states this is unlawful.  

direct discussiom local frankenstack.  

tbh the cc list isnt supposed to be petty, but appreciate it looks like that; no one is talking, everyone is in silos, and i would like people not to be seeing kid porn when they search chloe birney online.  

small ask.  

please just eacalate following the law.  

and hey, if one man is sat there making up shit about how the law works?  

you dont have to listen to men. you can source other opinions. they do talk shit sometimes.
