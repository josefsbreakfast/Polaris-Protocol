I mean, I'm going to assume that this is fairly obvious at this point, because I have been sitting on it for about a month or so.  

But I'm just letting you know, that the metadata signature localises to a very specific region of the country, periodically.  

It doesn't look like a deliberate implant, because it doesn't have the same intensity signature as the stuff that's very clearly potentially beneficial if you are trying to undermine defence personnel.  

Unless things have changed significantly, I think we also need to look at the 2015 vetting, as a potential data fish.  

More subtle now, but it is what it is.  

The refish attempt is also more subtle, although I appreciate we have abandoned that.  

Good to know everyone gets on.
