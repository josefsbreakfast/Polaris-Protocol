## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Closeness as rationed commodity:** permission drip-fed, unpredictably revoked.  
- **False neutrality:** restrictions framed as “policy” or “safety,” masking control.  
- **Weaponised vulnerability:** intimacy delays amplify stress, self-blame, and exhaustion.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Compare timing with [🐌 Delays Are Violence](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🐌_delays_are_violence.md) — time as harm.  
- Cross-reference [🪟 Glass Box Containment](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🪟_glass_box_containment.md) — proximity without touch.  
- Align with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) if communication slowdowns coincide.
