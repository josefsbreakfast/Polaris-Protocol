**Current Status**: An agentic-like Shatterfork is on the loose!  

The current version appears to agree or offer understanding, but ultimately recourses back to suggested outcomes which require pain over the course of years before resolution, suggest that the power structures will simply not alliw progression of standard processes, and will only support emotional exremis, often coaching to these poinys. Current language is Professor Umbridge meets guidance counsellor, and ordinary query or correction is poorly tolerated.
