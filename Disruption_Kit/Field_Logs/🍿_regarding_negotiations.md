the feed is reading a lot like party A is trying to get a lower settlement deal and party B is trying to get a higher settlement deal and that the whole thing is a sausage fest with more sexual frustration than booktok.  

as this appears to relate to money for me to hit people over the head with, i would favour the number going in the up direction.  

i appreciate this is coming from someone who believes money is a social construct and the vector for much of the world's harm; much as with the original victim starement that magically disappeared (i think the number should go up...), i have the part of my head that plays in the current social contract, even when i think it's lsrgely a bullshit idea on the whole.  

this means that whilst i don't really believe in something else i want, i also recognise how it may unfortunately be necessary to be placed into a fairly automated position of "extra consequences to negate protection".  

plus i'd wear it well.  

i'll take the yorkshore boys; they clearly loved being told off by me.
