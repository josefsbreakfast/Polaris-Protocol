On the back of endless inserts inc child deaths and sexualised content (the "readings")...  

I personally do not understand what we are all doing here.  

I am obviously extremely distressed by this situation and I am not seeing any meaningful improvement.  

I am incredibly annoyed about the whole thing and I am *fucking tired*.  

I don’t understand why I’m not worth protecting in any real sense.  

I’m sorry to rain on the serotonin parade but words are meaningless at this point.  

I don’t have stability and safety in a real sense.  

I’m pretty gutted that the politics of this means I am worth nothing to anyone who might have the ability to help in a practical sense.  

So many people are effectively blocked from speaking to me and it’s awful.  

It looks like I'm supposed to just run head-first at walls until I have nothing left, and that doesn't feel like a sustainable option for everyone in the same position.
