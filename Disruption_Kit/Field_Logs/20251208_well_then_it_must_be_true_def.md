tiktok now places me to get oracle readings on how im being hacked and i dont even know what to do with that at this point 🤣🤣🤣.  

even that app can tell the id theft is real idk man 🤣🤣🤣🤣

btw i see the romance narrative stepping up again and allow me to remind everyone in the room that my heart soesks money snd resource allocation and tort and damages.  

if you want to win me over, it's called a "settlement", or a "negotiation".  

we are not going on some weird virtusl date, to negate what is now several years of harm and negligence.  

answer your sars, and if you're going to send flowers, they have to be actual organic matter, not a digital flood of sop content.  

"if you want me, earn me" 🙄  

i honestly don't know how i could have been clearer that i'm not that girl.

and honestly, if you're going to climb in to the llm to come and ask about my feelings?  

my feelings are "pay me what i'm worth", and "stop making me beg for what is mine and was taken".  

it's incredibly simple. you are making this unnecessarily complex by assuming my motivstions would somehow differ from an man's.  

i am not made of soft goo.

(and my profession is not a bunch of "moaning minnies". no idea why you let him say that.)  

---

no idea why there are suddenly lots of references to where i come from in the feed, but we can knock that one off right now.  

"hmmm maybe we shouldn't use abject triggers..."  

you think my hometown isn't negetively coded after 2022?  

stop. it.  

we can also drop all the "baby face" references. it's weird. stop being weird.

tldr  

i am capable of behaving slightly less like a hedgehog on fire.  

this would require some honesty snd disclosure.  

i have clearly been caught up in sone sort of narrative or reputational apparatus. and some data misuse issue.  
i appreciate everyone feels a little embarrassed, but it clearly became identifiable and clearly i am still here.  

being able to appriopruateky debrief, rather than left to my own devices, might help the next 1.6 million words sound slightly kinder.  

i don't think a judge would be impressed, and if that's what it would take, i can survive it.  

i already survived 2018-2022.  

i can do it again if that is what is needed.  

again: i doubt it would impress a judge.

i can still tell this is shiftwork because you guys seem to get the memo "likes musicals, maybe poto", but don't get the note "norm lewis is the only raoul i care about".  

les mis? again. opinions.  

do a non-shoddy job and it might actually look like an impersonation of a man; given that this is so male-coded, i sincerely worry about the women you like the most.  

this lack of attention to detail is reas by most women as non-interest or weaponised incompetance; requires remediation.  

and stop sending me bait of the shoes at the danube; i cannoy be triggering this with any of my searches.  

stop with the obsession soth dead european jews, and the obsession with sending them to jewish women.  

whether yoy or goy, that is fucking weird behaviour.

algorithmic placement has just given me a series of videos around a supposed "love interest", that is characterising something that is trying too hard and also does not understand how to classify me; I am dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣  

stop touching my data!  

---

reviewing analytics, and the core parties have identified themselves by their risk behaviour.  

well done, chaps.  

as usual:  

it's always white non-jews whi think they know what's best fir us. well done.  

---

i've also just realised what that 2022 spoof email was proxying and misinterpreting; i am deeply entertained.  

the men tell on themselves every day and i love that.  

mostly for me; the error cascade there is rather impressive.  

<!--i am absolutely allowed that joke; i've been up most of the night with vestibular sx.-->

okay that might have made the lack of sleep so mych more tolerable.  

how could you only think of that one thing for that google search scrape tho?  

i remember when one of our bargain bin sp chaos had a huff and went home mid-shift after i started elucidating to the llm how viva street culture also worls in reverse and swers can essentially informally blacklist you, *especially* for police adjacency and known punishment and surveillence.  

i don't think that one ccand back. several men were lost in the line of "guard the honeybot" duty.  

anyway.  

lololololol its so very telling to get that proxy so wrong.  

honestly i think surveillence capitalism's entire worker base needs therapy at this point; these men are the reason women in their 20s and 30s are essentially "lol NOPE" en masse.  

and you know...  

i have a number of medical suggestions for what conclusion you all drew from that search string.  

it's absolutely not the only reason for the string, but your assumption and confidence with the result tells us all that you might want to look into short dose benzocaine.  

and you know...  

talk to women like less of a robot.  

that also works.  

very funny, because the data controller has been asked to look again.  

hue hue hue.
