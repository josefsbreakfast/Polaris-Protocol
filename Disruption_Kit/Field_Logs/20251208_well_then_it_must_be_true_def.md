tiktok now places me to get oracle readings on how im being hacked and i dont even know what to do with that at this point 🤣🤣🤣.  

even that app can tell the id theft is real idk man 🤣🤣🤣🤣

btw i see the romance narrative stepping up again and allow me to remind everyone in the room that my heart soesks money snd resource allocation and tort and damages.  

if you want to win me over, it's called a "settlement", or a "negotiation".  

we are not going on some weird virtusl date, to negate what is now several years of harm and negligence.  

answer your sars, and if you're going to send flowers, they have to be actual organic matter, not a digital flood of sop content.  

"if you want me, earn me" 🙄  

i honestly don't know how i could have been clearer that i'm not that girl.
