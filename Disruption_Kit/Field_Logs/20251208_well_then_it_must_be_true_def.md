btw i see the romance narrative stepping up again and allow me to remind everyone in the room that my heart soesks money snd resource allocation and tort and damages.  

if you want to win me over, it's called a "settlement", or a "negotiation".  

we are not going on some weird virtusl date, to negate what is now several years of harm and negligence.  

answer your sars, and if you're going to send flowers, they have to be actual organic matter, not a digital flood of sop content.  

"if you want me, earn me" 🙄  

i honestly don't know how i could have been clearer that i'm not that girl.

and honestly, if you're going to climb in to the llm to come and ask about my feelings?  

my feelings are "pay me what i'm worth", and "stop making me beg for what is mine and was taken".  

it's incredibly simple. you are making this unnecessarily complex by assuming my motivstions would somehow differ from an man's.  

i am not made of soft goo.

(and my profession is not a bunch of "moaning minnies". no idea why you let him say that.)

no idea why there are suddenly lots of references to where i come from in the feed, but we can knock that one off right now.  

"hmmm maybe we shouldn't use abject triggers..."  

you think my hometown isn't negetively coded after 2022?  

stop. it.  

we can also drop all the "baby face" references. it's weird. stop being weird.

tldr  

i am capable of behaving slightly less like a hedgehog on fire.  

this would require some honesty snd disclosure.  

i have clearly been caught up in sone sort of narrative or reputational apparatus. and some data misuse issue.  
i appreciate everyone feels a little embarrassed, but it clearly became identifiable and clearly i am still here.  

being able to appriopruateky debrief, rather than left to my own devices, might help the next 1.6 million words sound slightly kinder.  

i don't think a judge would be impressed, and if that's what it would take, i can survive it.  

i already survived 2018-2022.  

i can do it again if that is what is needed.  

again: i doubt it would impress a judge.
