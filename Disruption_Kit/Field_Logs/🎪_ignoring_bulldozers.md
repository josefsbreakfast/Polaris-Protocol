creation of 'ðŸªž_humiliation_as_spectacle.md' v interesting.

days for not being able to put certain sections together, was political sensitivity of partition, and the discussion of sexual violence.  

This is not actually the material that it struggled with in practice; it had already handled these in the chat before it said this.  

What Chat GPT actually struggled to generate, was the links between the way some encampments have been dismantled at universities in western countries, which mimic the theatre of humiliation in the West Bank.  

I imagine that what we are trying to get around here, and which there were lots of unnecessary added steps in the process, which help distract from the point for the user, is how strange it would be the universities in the US and the UK dismantled Palestinian solidarity encampments in a manner which mimics the particular performance of humiliation conducted in the West Bank to civilians who are Palestinian.  

You don't need to understand about the own sectioning to understand that the destruction of those homes is legal under international law; when the government says that it's permitted, this is by the government's own decision to ignore the ICJ.  

This is why anyone still investing in the companies on the OCHA list, and many of us still do and still use them, it seem to be complicit in genocide.  

just because the host country is telling you that it's okay for them, doesn't absolve you individually from accountability.  

I really think sometimes that people forget what happened if people who viewed is collaborators in occupied Europe; this still impacts people today.  

We are never ever going to solve the cycle of intense violence which has followed us through the entirety of the 20th century, if we continue to say, "it's legal in X country".  

People have long memories. Especially when their family homes and ancestral lands are destroyed.  

We can't keep going along with this and pretending that it has no impact on us; as long as we materially benefit from it and we do in the UK to some degree (variable per person/institution), people will remember.  

There are still elders in the Jewish community who will not buy German cars, and how could you blame them?  

I've not yet checker to see if the output has neen completely misconstrued from its meaning.
