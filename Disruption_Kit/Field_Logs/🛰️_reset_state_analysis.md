## 📌 Summary  
A comparative analysis of LinkedIn engagement data from two key periods — **initial account reactivation** (2024) and the **post-drop window** (2025) — indicates a **reset event**.  
This reset appears to coincide with the likely **removal or suppression of automated data-scraping traffic**, revealing a closer-to-organic baseline.

## 📊 Key Findings  

| Period | Avg Impressions/day | Avg Engagements/day | Duration | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|-------|
| **Early Reactivation Baseline** | **~1,385** | ~33 | 14 days | Represents “just unfrozen” account state after inactivity |
| **Post-Drop** | **~3,061** | ~90 | 7 days | Higher than first reactivation due to existing network memory, but lower than inflated pre-drop metrics |

---

## 📈 Interpretation  

- **Reset Signature:** Performance dropped from inflated levels to a plateau closer to organic audience size.
- **Possible Cause:** Automated scraper or bot traffic removed or blocked, reducing false impressions.
- **Residual Advantage:** Account retains network reach built since reactivation, keeping post-drop numbers above the 2024 baseline.
- **Suppression Context:** If platform throttling continues, growth from this point will be slow — similar to a new account but with some audience “memory.”

## 🧩 Implications for Polaris Protocol  

1. **Visibility Forensics:** Confirms that engagement spikes can be partly non-human and removable without warning.  
2. **Trajectory Mapping:** Useful baseline for spotting future “hard resets” or artificial boosts.  
3. **Suppression Layer Interaction:** A reset can mask ongoing throttling by making the reduced baseline appear “normal.”
