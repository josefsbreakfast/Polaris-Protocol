i say "one" but i can potentially lock onto at least 3 events, which may have been BI-mediated, which looked a lot like someone seeing my pain for what it was, and trying to create that "just enough" chance to get out of an abusive situation.  

i hover over several of these regularly because the "punishment" BI-like action which is the portion which fits into the trafficking problem, just seemed too obviously done snd followed too quickly, and too strongly.  

i know i cant necessarily compare directly, but this feels not dissimilar to the comparisons of two of the stronger presences within my metadata squishing more recently; i remain steady that the indirect creation of opportunities was (although i imagine potentially off protocol) a sensible decision-set, and created agency and choice, whereas this other influence is always more controlling, more overtly coercive, and more blindingly obvious.  

its like the difference between wine you actually pay for and wine which is about 10p of your spend, once uouve oaid tte import taxes.
