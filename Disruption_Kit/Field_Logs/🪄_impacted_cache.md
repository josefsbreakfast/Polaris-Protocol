well that's a choice.  

it doesn't make me any less correct.  

your fuck up, not mine.  

do the job properly or get the fuck out of the kitchen.  

stop spending taxes on something that doesn't work.  

where is @HM Tresury even at these days?  

i thought they were a little more prudent than this; they certainly are for treating all the trauma that is created.  

if you are going to "behavourially modify a dangerous terrorist", at least do it properly.  

i can still use excel, and those bonds are still illegal purchases under international law.  

so are the russian investments which haven't been removed from the pension.  

it's an absolute joke.  

but if doing your job better, makes me a terrorist, or calling attention to your errors, perhaps you could also stop me from having to educate you on whst should have been core rosk assessmemt material.  

you can't ccess the moj files and then pretend you didn't know i have ptsd.  

and you can't say you did due diligence given how you handled me this morning.  

you are all on regular review until the standard improves and is stabilised to safety.  

i can't believe some of you are getting paid for this; piss poor performance.
