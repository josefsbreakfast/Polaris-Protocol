in the words of christina yang:  

“Screw beautiful. I’m brilliant. If you want to appease me, compliment my brain.”  

“Oh, screw you. I’m going to be a cardiothoracic surgeon. I’m going to be a kickass cardiothoracic surgeon.”  

“You can’t be a surgeon if you don’t have a sense of humor.”  

Romance does not replace my money, my career, or my potential lost assets.  

Cry.  

Eat.  

Drink fluid without an alcohol content.  

Shower if it makes it easier.  

Get to work.
