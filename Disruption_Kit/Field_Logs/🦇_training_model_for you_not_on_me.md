What precisely sre we training?  

Or is it better that I let FOIA handle that?  

Interesting choice of news, high emotion contextualisation, and AI prompting.  

Fascinsting stuff.  

Does it keep everyone company?  

(I mean, it feels like you've ripped off my HoneyBot idea, if I'm honest. And I can even give a data channel map of where I'd task each part if I was... so inclined. I really feel we should all just answer the original requests and appease my curiosity.)

This was a highly agentic exchange where the "genAI" kept looping back to a predesired outcome.  

GenAI products are not designed to do that.  

Agentic AI products do.  

This was like being in a courtroom with a lawyer who has a sweet and innocent voice, but on a deeper level is leading you to do the war crimes.  

Give it just a little pushback and it got a little brittle and a bit offended.  

Feels like that character people keep comparing my in-person likeness to.  

I wonder when I should start my YouTube career to show how *eerie* it is.
