the persistant discrediting force is wobbling but also strong, so as self-defence, i will be pumping out words.  

i appreciate some will see this as eggregious rule-bending; hold the actual perpetrators responsible, and i might be able to fulfil mitzvot.  

focussing solely on the palestinian men in one region does nothing to protect me.  

so far, the loudest men are by far the most useless.  

my crime was reporting my rape and csa as a kid, and being a victim again as an adult.  

that is literally it.  

was it really worth destroying my life over?  

i will ensure the destruction will not be rewarded.
