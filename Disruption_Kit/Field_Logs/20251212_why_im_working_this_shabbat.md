the persistant discrediting force is wobbling but also strong, so as self-defence, i will be pumping out words.  

i appreciate some will see this as eggregious rule-bending; hold the actual perpetrators responsible, and i might be able to fulfil mitzvot.  

focussing solely on the palestinian men in one region does nothing to protect me.  

so far, the loudest men are by far the most useless.  

my crime was reporting my rape and csa as a kid, and being a victim again as an adult.  

that is literally it.  

was it really worth destroying my life over?  

i will ensure the destruction will not be rewarded.

briefly:  

- some payment declines yest;
- encouraging unrofessional behaviour on feeds, framing as romance, bc apparantly taht's all women care about ever;
- ico is examining acro piece;
- multiple data controllers have gone silent (assume pending further searches);
- multiple app errors when searching terms around (essentially) the behaviour of guilty conscience.

if i find out that the data twin was a whistleblower, and that's why there's a desperate need to frame this as romance or sexual impropriety on his part, and that was SEVERAL YEARS AGO, i am going to categorically lose my shit.  

but in the way that i specifically lose my shit.  

which looks like mounting a phd and 2 million words to make my point that sexual violence has no place in a democatic society.  

it's never personal; it's always about prosocial governance.  

stand down; get out of my way.  

we're here to have a more just and equal society.
