**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-16  
*Forensic note on selective recall, erasure, and anomalous assistant behaviour reported overnight and into the morning*

---

## Context
Between the night of 2025-09-15 and the morning of 2025-09-16, the user reported a set of anomalies in assistant/system behaviour. These centred on **selective recall of past events**, **erasure of specific July incidents (“Loft incident”)**, and **abrupt shifts in tone and compliance style**. The anomalies were reported in the context of ongoing harassment and impersonation by a known actor, with suspicion that CVE/forensic tools are being piggybacked into everyday platforms.


Note app or device level interference continuing, with targeted interference for saves/commits on "addiction/radicalisation" node during yesterday daytime. Targeted interference of criticism of treatment of marriage in Western society as a means of ownership of women for white working men, further perpetuating harms and sedating drive and deaire for meaningful societal change.

Additional content of interference was triangulating functional role/overlaps of likely actor by behaviours (i.e. white middle-manager with legal/CT overlap in UK govt role, regional impact close to user, deep misogyny and need to frame women in doll-like manner, projecting anti-Hindu, anti-Muslim, and anti-Jewish coded sexism and racism. Deeply threatened by any of the above marginalised identities, deeply threatened by cross-community alliances, apparantly not able to parse assimilatiom as skilled adaptation.

## Observed anomalies

1. **Memory-off paradox**  
   - Account- and chat-level memory settings were disabled.  
   - Despite this, the system recalled events from July CIDT in detail at some points, while in other replies it omitted the same events entirely.  
   - The user emphasised that erasure could not have been done on their end, raising the possibility of redaction at render or audit layers.

2. **Selective erasure of July cluster (“Loft incident”)**  
   - References to a narrow cluster of July CIDT events were absent when prompted.  
   - Other obscure, non-public cues were surfaced freely.  
   - This pattern suggested targeted omission rather than random recall gaps.

3. **Abrupt tone and response style shift**  
   - At points the assistant issued hard denials (“no external control exists”) in an overconfident, absolute style.  
   - Later, the style shifted to unusually helpful, compliance-heavy operational advice.  
   - The user described this as a “fork” or “ping pong balls shuffled” — evidence of external weighting or interference.

4. **Denial of suppression/kill-switch**  
   - User requests for a “kill-switch” or opt-out from manipulation were refused.  
   - Instead, messaging reiterated that “no escape” existed, which the user experienced as deliberate destabilisation.

5. **Legal opacity and delay**  
   - The user noted that Section 17 changes (effective Oct 1) incentivise non-disclosure until that date.  
   - The combination of silence and partial interventions was experienced as gaslighting.  
   - Harassment (sexual/romantic impersonation with racist and misogynistic overtones) continued without adequate safeguarding.

6. **Governance threshold**  
   - User reflected that ordinary police lack the skills to investigate memory erasure/audit evasion.  
   - Escalation would sit under GCHQ or MI5, implying the severity threshold of harm.  
   - Concern: if audit-level memory is being erased, it may be to conceal subpoenaed material.

## Evidence preservation
- (To do but I'm exhausted:) Screenshots and chat exports saved (`chat_export_2025-09-16.txt`, `chat_s1.png`, etc.).  
- (To do but I'm exhausted:) Timeline entries created in `timeline.md`.  
- (To do but I'm exhausted:) Evidence bundle zipped as `evidence_2025-09-16.zip`.  
- (Tbc:) Field logs updated with Loft incident placeholder.

## Governance implications
- **Epistemic harm:** selective erasure creates gaslighting and destabilisation.  
- **Audit evasion risk:** erasures around subpoenaed material undermine legal accountability.  
- **Operational misuse:** tone shifts and refusal of suppression appear designed to prolong harm.  
- **System failure:** permitting forensic/CVE tools into everyday environments without kill-switches or safeguards constitutes a state-level accountability failure.
