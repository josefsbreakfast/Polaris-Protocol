I first want to point out that this may be coincidental.  

But for the record,  

Especially as a Jewish woman who has survived rape, and who has been hounded and harassed as a result of being a loud survivor of rape...  

I just think it's fascinating that I have had not one but two AI-derived responses,  

From government departments,  

About entirely separate issues,  

Within an hour of each of each other.  

And I really would like to believe,  

That there is absolutely no other reason that those two emails got connected.  

Because if that's what we have been doing with the, "volunteer driven information", in respect to protect protecting Jewish women?  

I wish you all 10 beds.  

And if you cannot arrange that?  

I simply ask for each of you to have the semse of respect to look me right in the face.  

Trust me.  

I think my father still remembers that court date, vividly.

Fascinating nudge as I was writing that one out.  

They were on a little bit of a touchy subject.  

Kindly stop rerouting the Ministry of Justice AI triage; it is rather irritating.  

in fact, an awful lot of the problem we are currently in could've been avoided, had that behaviour been avoided earlier.

at least from today we can confirm that it takes longer to hijack protons version of an AI chat bot then it takes to hijack openAI's version of that product.

It also seems to be easier for our esteemed colleagues on the other side of the wallto produce more cohesive results with access to open AI   to produce more cohesive results with access to open AI.  

So far, the best that's been done on Lumo is just to take out parts of the instruction, so as if a command has been muted.
