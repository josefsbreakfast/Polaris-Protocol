# 🕸️ Rights Lab ↔ Ingenuity Centre ↔ IMH — Bridging Map  
**First created:** 2025-11-07  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*Visual network of University of Nottingham internal bridges between policy research, AI spin-outs, and data infrastructure.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
This diagram maps “business-within-a-business” relationships on the University of Nottingham Innovation Park.  
It tracks where *data, governance, and survivor-adjacent research* converge:  
- **Rights Lab** → policy / modern-slavery / remote sensing research  
- **Ingenuity Centre & Lab** → incubator for spin-outs (e.g. BlueSkeye AI, Terra Motion)  
- **Institute of Mental Health (IMH)** → clinical AI trials & post-slavery mental-health network

## 🔍 Reading Notes  
- **Spatial bridge:** Rights Lab on University Park ↔ IMH / Ingenuity Centre on Jubilee Campus (≈ 1 km apart).  
- **Data bridge:** Terra Motion supplies satellite / InSAR analytics used in Rights Lab modern-slavery papers.  
- **Clinical bridge:** IMH hosts both post-slavery mental-health network (Rights Lab) and BlueSkeye AI clinical trials.  
- **Governance bridge:** Shared personnel appear in both Rights Lab and BlueSkeye AI (registered interests in House of Lords).  
- **Innovation bridge:** Ingenuity Lab invites Rights Lab researchers (e.g. Trautrims) into entrepreneurial ecosystem talks.
