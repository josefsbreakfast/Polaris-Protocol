so I'm aware that the algorithm is just leaking whoever I'm attached to, and sharing pieces of data from them to me.  

I'm aware that there are several high stakes individuals; well done lads. genius plan.  

I have a few comments/queries:  

- Would we like to talk about what "the princess diana (z"L)" thing was about?

- Would we like to talk about case separation?

- Given recent feed dynamics, do I need to ask whether you're surveilling actual members of my family, several of which would have specific legal instruments that you would have to overcome? Or shall I take it that the Rabbinate has grown quite a backbone? (if you pissed them off, is that really my fault?)

- I'm also going to take it that metadara spin works as an umbrella term? as much as I am probably more intelligent than you think I am, I also need to point out that it's not uncommon once you have fresh eyes on something, to add to a discussion. This has happened many times in my life. If you engage an MDT work, this is a regular occurrence. This is part of the reason that we have to work across to disciplines, if we want a strong robust academic section.

(given how south Asia's universities are absolutely knocking us out the park in the league tables, we might want to think about that.).  

I hate to say this, but a lot of it means giving people time to engage in what the brain categories as play and as rest; this is where ingenuity lies.
