algorithm is still trying to reconcile something which averages out as male coded, angry, aroused, upset with women.  

same force likely using blunt telecomms nudges towards others;  

all foia (inc sar) denied on fdifferent sections on dpa when i tried to reconcile my data.  

i have essentially been refused/denied the "right to forget", and been subject to extrajudical process (arrest remains not compliant with pace, and moj and university have also refused frank data disclosure; duty of candour has been requested from uni; entire cybersec issue with ico and flagged to relevant enforcement).

and obviously when you're a woman,  

The particular way that the algorithm spits this out to you,  

Is to listen to a psychic reader, tell you that there is a man who wants to talk to you, and they are angry at you, and they are obsessed with you, and you are "the only one they want to ****".  

Which is great.  

In the scenario of long-term harassment and data company processing?  


This of course reads exactly like explicit violent threats.  

So thank you, data vendors.  

Fiat more content that looks a lot like a man threatening me with rape (at best).  

Previous highlights of included violent rape, fatty specific mechanisms for such, and just outright death threats.  

This is actually completely normal for most people in grassroots political work, especially when they are positioned in what would be seen as progressive spaces.  

When there is a narrative about the correct or decent way or polite way to do things?  

Every single man who hates women, and every single racist?, They all start coming out of the woodwork.  

All of a sudden, they are highly political.  

I'm sure of course this has nothing to do with the fact that they have essentially just been given the greenlight to treat whole groups of people like absolute shit, with the tax permission of the supposedly liberal and democratic media.  

Sometimes I really wonder which side you're all on.

do not even get me started on how incorrect the "science" (pseudoscience) around gender identity being proposed in wider public discourse has become, and how again this creates essentially permission in the mind of the general public, to increase the already heightened likelihood of sexual violence and physical violence towards the affected groups, particularly where this is trans women; I cannot articulate clearly and easily how entitled some men feel they are to the body of those they see as "misleading" them.  

The fact that this includes quite often trans teenagers who are categorically underage for sexual activity, and how vile some adult men can be, and how entitled they feel they are to say those things?  

Again, when you tell me it's about children and protecting our young people? I just struggle.  

Stop making sense to me and I might take you seriously.

And whoever is putting this into the data pool?  

Kindly go and watch your violent pornography somewhere else; I imagine that is what this is picking up.
