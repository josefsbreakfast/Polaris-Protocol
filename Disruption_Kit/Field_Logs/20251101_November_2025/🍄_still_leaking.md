2025-11-11.  

a lot of things from yesterday really made my head gnaw.  

something i am considering is just how "inside" the labour party the unwanted presense in my metadata got, how much it was relying on boring policy being defaultto being useful by comparison, how much it was desperate to remain hiding behind jews to justify surveillemce investmsnt and access in the midlamds, and how much trouble *previsely* it stirred up in that institutional exposure, in its obsessive projection onto brown men in particular.  

it's not an unusual set of motivations: a number of political sidelines actors are this way inclined.  

im just not not sure i can see why the effort was worth it; it seems like a lit of risk and a lot of complication when one could soend the same effort just being really good at something useful.

(given that ghosts wre the core of whatever this is/waa, its easier to just talk about it as a sort if composite personality; precise nature and intent is kess relevant ti ke than, "siiiiigh.... who do i have to foia next 🙄")

it also sots pretty adjuscemt to several adictive, harm-causing, and coercive industries; a lit of tye time it really just looks like a hedge fund personified, rather than an actual person. its somewhat close ti news aggregators, and definitiy fancies s bit of suthoritarianism in the uk.  

somehos it is sitting to some health r&d funding/influence.  

i can give legal entities or people (public eye people) that or somewhat close, bit im wondering if this is a bit more hybrid; its almost cooy snd paste of something in another state but with funding tafgets chosen for access ir direct gain.  

its perculiar.

(the frankenghost element also means this may just be representing investors:funders/colleagues which are heavily cross-linked to ghost pieces.)  
it also needs to be created by a dumbass whi underestimates a number of people; general disregard across the board for everyone doing/having done any hands-on oublic service, in a "gate you because i aint you" manner.  

i also cant believe meta is "only" soying in oeople in dec. on paper. whag jokes.  

the frankenghist also has a thing for nobility in that it has a stange semse of awe; as if its bought in but its not one.  

curious thing.  

like the ghost if an old victorian landlord whi gets annoyed that tb kills the rent-machine, essentualky.  

general disregard for women, jews, sees hindus as useful, and almost certainly pronounces the word, "mislems".  

short in the sense of humour.
