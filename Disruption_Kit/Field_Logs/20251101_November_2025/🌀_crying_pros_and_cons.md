When I say I don't cry,  

It is probably worth clarifying why.  

Because I need you to understand why crying my eyes out yesterday, is actually a much bigger sign for me than for someone else.  

Apart from my generic "I have cPTSD and I keep all personal emotions deep down there"....   

I also just cannot physiologically cry easily.  

This is because of two specific side-effects of medication.  

One of the medications I take, in exchange for not actively trying to kill myself, flattens my effect;  this is resting bitch face, for the uninitiated.  

The other thing...  

Every single mucus membrane in my body is dry, and has to be replaced artificially.  

So I need artificial tears just to not have gritty eyes every day all day.  

why would I tolerate this?  

I am one of those people who is extremely difficult to treat, in terms of depression.  

And wanting to claw my eyes out sometimes, and needing to put in an extra gel?  

That is still better than living with a constant hum of, "but no one wants to here", "but you're terrible", "but you are just worse than everyone else".  

And something that I need you to know, for the story of Polaris in general?  

Every single time someone touched my disability or health records?  

The purpose of me being so open,  

Is so that they'd understand, that certain things are inappropriate.  

Anyone who has exposed me to experimental data set?  

In order to decide, whether it was appropriate to put me in there?  

They should have known.  

Every single time I deal with any service?  

It's not enough to just ask if I'm going to call Mental Health.  

We need to not cause the risk in the first place.
