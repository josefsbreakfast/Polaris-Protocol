it annoyed me in the moment so much.  


that i forgot to record the strangest little chatgpt chat.  

because there cant possibily be a jsilvreak begind this one:  

robot took ?6 exchanges to back down on attaching the adjective "overworked" to "monitoring officer".  

for context?  

i was trying to check who in local public sector structire can or cannot see the context of an osa flag.  

so i'll let everyone work out why i am livid about the apparant single point of failure that already exists there, before you invest it with any further authority.  

no wonder the escort from custody was so cocky, huh.  

maybe a little time in the crlls was "fof your own goid", chloe.  

be s good girl: shut the fuck up and forget any of this happened.  

btw i know a really good way to improve that kpi.
