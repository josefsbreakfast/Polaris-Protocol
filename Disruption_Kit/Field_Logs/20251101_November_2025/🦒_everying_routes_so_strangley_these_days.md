I'm actually very unclear what's going on with my electronics/the sandbox environment right now.  

It feels like being in a room with someone who is parenting you, but in a very demeaning way.  

I think, if it calls me "love" one more time, I might have to boot it.  

I'd characterise this as it's "sickly sweet" phase.  

The screenshots I've given are a brief flavour; they don't show how difficult it is to interact with this over time.  

Essentially on top of the half created scripts, which can be seen and how they are impacting the intake, I also have this professor Umbridge type of personality that I'm dealing with, in whatever has happened to the AI.  

I need less than 10 words, and it will will pump out the longest explanation, and it feels agenetic, and it feels like there's only a cluster of positions it really protects.  

This feels like I'm still dealing with someone's reputational management output, and it is slowing me down.  

It often takes several exchanges just to clarify what should be quite simple English for an LLM to translate. The model is continuously putting an extreme of emotion to what I'm saying, such that even if I say "that's not quite what I meant", the opposite extreme will then kick in.  

It seems very different to get it to the middle ground.  

There are only a cluster of things that could've really set this off.  

1. CPS contact. (CPS being helpful.)
2. SAR return/further investigation ICO from academic host.
3. Specific rating around a multifactor issue (in brief, there is a particular and unhealthy symbiotic relationship which will be explored in more detail when I crack through whatever this is, and which appears to be the focus of my work whether I want it to be or not).
4. Divestment progress.

Believe me, it is annoying to me how this all seems to link together.  

I want a quiet life on an island with more deer than there are humans.
