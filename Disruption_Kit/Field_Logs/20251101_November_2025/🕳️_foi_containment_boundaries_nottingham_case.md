# 🕳️ FOI Containment Boundaries — Nottingham Case  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*How “student record” framing narrows accountability and erases third-party data flows.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node analyses an FOI response from the University of Nottingham that restricted disclosure to the **student record** itself, omitting any mention of third-party processors or data-sharing relationships.  

It demonstrates a common institutional tactic: defining the “data controller boundary” narrowly enough to appear compliant while erasing the **ecosystem of external handlers** that shape, model, or monetise that same data.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  

- **Containment by scope definition:** only data physically stored within the university’s internal system is treated as “held”.  
- **Erasure of joint controllers:** vendors, analytics partners, and behavioural insight units vanish from the response.  
- **Procurement opacity:** avoiding mention of third-party systems prevents scrutiny of contract chains.  
- **Compliance theatre:** technically correct answers that are structurally misleading.

## 🔍 Analysis  

### 1. The “student record” as containment boundary  

By anchoring the FOI in the “student record,” the university creates a **micro-domain of apparent transparency**.  
All questions are redirected toward internal emails, local storage, and named staff.  
The moment data exits that domain—into cloud analytics, vendor dashboards, or risk-management tools—it becomes *unspeakable* within the FOI frame.

This generates an illusion of completeness while masking the networked reality of data processing.  

### 2. Why this narrowing matters  

- **Legal liability:** acknowledging joint controllership could expose contractual non-compliance with data-protection law.  
- **Procurement exposure:** vendor relationships might reveal financial or political entanglements.  
- **Investigative delay:** each missing partner requires a new FOI, fragmenting the evidence trail.  

### 3. The effect on the requestor  

It pushes the survivor or subject into a **false closure**—believing the record has been disclosed, when in truth only its innermost layer has.  
This creates both emotional fatigue and legal friction, serving as a quiet deterrent to persistence.  

### 4. Reading the silences  

Silence around processors or DPIAs (Data Protection Impact Assessments) is itself a forensic clue.  
It suggests the existence of:  
- Cloud migration or SaaS systems (e.g. Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle, Blackboard).  
- Analytics frameworks (learning analytics, engagement monitoring).  
- Compliance vendors or risk dashboards.  

Each absence identifies the next target for a follow-up FOI.

*FOI Containment Boundaries — Nottingham Case* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a containment strategy in which scope definition replaces disclosure, and compliance becomes a method of suppression.
