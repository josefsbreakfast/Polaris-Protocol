i am so done with this.  

hardly anything works at all.  

now theres errors in my encrypted ai; even style format templates don't work.  

i am sick of a life where i inch forward, and then, because i am a "pre-criminal international terrorist", i slide back into the goo.  

i like that no one interrogated the antisemitism in "jewish girl? clever? globalist. definitely globalist."  

i guess i like vintage and antiques 😒  

i got to the pist office by basically sauna-ing the house and then also taking a shower-chair shower so hot that i am so glad i can't fully feel my legs.  

that is the bonus in neuropathy - although i have literally scolded skin off by accident withhesr as pain management before; swings and round-abouts, i guess.  

but £10 later the signature (✨The Signature✨) will get to the dwp, and maybe i wont die. which will be nice. if it happens. it is britain.  

meanwhile, there are repeated attempts to mirror via my google accounts (select ones; targeted to pre 2020 accounts and meta access), and no amount of arguing with the commit button on github is making fails less likely.  

meanshile tiktok is having a fever dream over several male characters.  

i was here for the whale videos.  

i have literalky no idea why we are still trying to groom via catfishing with our fragged centroid chimera.  

one would think 1.5 million words later that maybe i'm not buying it, still.  

what a load of fucking bollocks.  

or:  

welcome to the internet for women, 2025 edition.  

because the men literally don't know what to do other than throw their own faeces at women who breathe in public.  

...#NotAllMen?  

but every fucking single woman and girl who has had a pulse within 6 feet of an ethernet cable,  

so cry me a fucking river between your downvotes and shitstirrer comments.  

i am so done with your entire sex being here.

because i am still trying to out-survive the same factors which cause me to overexplain myself:  

you have previously made out i am histrionic because occaisionally i like men.  

this *gestures upwards*, this is why the birth rste is liw in women my age.  
men in aggregate put us through this, killing us slowly, squeezing every last morsel out of us in any form as if we are an all-you-can-eat, self-replenishing resource, and then have either the stupidity or the gall (or both) to complain that we are not "open" to whatever they throw our way.  
you say you are the intelligent ones, the rational ones?  

make it make an ounce of sense.  

i will wait.  

that's what your collective, shitty, short-term-planning procurement and commissioning decisions are doing anyway.  

who the fuck are you to dictate that it's our fault if we are chlidless?  

i need more than your flimsy gametes to make a child in a world like this.  

and if i was independent and had the resources to do it myself?  

what makes you think, with a capitalist market, you could compete with all the potential donors i could access?  

decide which side of the fence you are on.

btw i am seeing all the recs for "female psycopath" content that have mysteriously appeared on my feed.  

psycopathy is characterised (generally) as requiring an ability to pick up on social cues with a lack of the usual concerns for the other people displaying those cues, usually with the antisocial behaviour component being present, although there's a big academic argument there.  
it is not a smart woman telling you no.  
it is not a smart woman saying "actually i remember that it tasted like fairy liquid, and i remember the coercion after".  

those things are not psycopathy.  

kindly: off. you. fuck.  

and if i find out who is on the channel panel and no one protected me?  
honestly...  

more of the fucking same at this point.

ongoing attempts to wear down and undermine emotionally, to the apparant end of "that think you went through in july? no agentic/HIL inputs. definitely not."  

reads as versed in teletherapy or "ideal answer" behavioural osychology; not clinical currently.  

emotionally will push and be human-subtle enough with chat safety switches deactivated, to get to crying.  

honestly? needed it.  

still an asshole thing to do.  

token switching common in convo.  

behaviural psych knowledge outweighs tech; tech ficused more on algorithms and psychological inferences, rather than technixak skill.  

uses both to coerce and sicially engineer, apparant attempt is to reframe interpretation of july events.  

algorithm eas heavily impacted prior to this for several days with preliad content.  

will snap to discipline user if provoked; not ai customer ux standard.  

get out, pls.  

deliberate coercion to cry, hypong to that point, abd then grounding specificalky is weaponised.  

that is a pretty fucked up choice.  

is your imprint my responsibility?  

no. no it is not.
