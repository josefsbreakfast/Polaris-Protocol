i know i cant debate how my case could be a petitioned exceptional circumstance, to the terms of the new assisted dying bill, because you would all lose your minds.  

but as long as i stay alive to get the problem for others fixed,  

then can you see how, after the protectove factors being destrpyed by the patterns of targeted violence snd harrassment which hit anyone likely to offer any defence to people indergoing genocide, may have destroyed my last protective factor?  

can you see how its unfair that the mha and mca would create resistance to ending my suffering?  

i cant even have any sedative drugs after my fathers record was merged with mine;  

i have to live every day with the physical pain of what he did, the surround sound imax experoence of what he did,  

plus all the inserts from the harrassment from 2018 to the present day,  

and i have had every reasonable means of exit, including suicide, taken away.  

can you not see how barbaric that is?  

i am literally being punished as a child rapist, for being raped as a child.  

and we are still prptectong whoever did that of left it running.  

do you think im the only one?  

are you all that naive?  

that's not just something one does "of and ut doesnt matter"; the fact it is apparantly unlikely to be an uncorrected admin mistake means that a hige amount of justice victims are at risk.  

and you welcone the people who would directly benefot from such a mistake through the door on contracts to fix it?  

i cannot even leave the country; i am coded as thd man who raped his own daughter, and everything attached.  

you all are so blinded by the shiny toys, to see that we welcome in the people who create these problems every single time.
