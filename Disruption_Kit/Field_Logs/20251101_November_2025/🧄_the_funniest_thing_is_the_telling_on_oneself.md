wanna point out that one of my data twin and i appear to be on a convergent algorithmic wave?  

algorithm starts spluttering some slightly incongruent content:  

"uh.. uh.. uh... YOU NEED TO CLEANSE YOUR SPACE!! NEGETIVE ENERGIES!!"  


I find this really interesting because, as someone who was training to be a doctor when this malicious data problem really hit (I'll let you guess why I'm no longer on course to qualify officially 🤣🤣🤣), I was already seeing a very interesting subversion of spirituality and New Age practice, and it was starting to really take over the online Anglophone witchcraft community.  

So in brief, yoga is not Nazi, but Nazis and Nazi adjacent politics has a habit of co-opting and culturally appropriating yoga. It therefore shouldn't be surprising, when we see, particularly after the mass death event of COVID, a significant repurposing of these forms of self-care and ways to look after the mind, be completely repurposed and subverted, in ways which support fascist and authoritarianism outputs.  

That is to say:  

I think folk practice is a good thing.  

I think it is very natural in the way that people work as humans.  

However, I see a lot of times where it becomes dangerous.  

Because I was interested in that grey zone anyway, I started researching this, and what I saw change in that course of time, was very interesting.  

That was a real authoritarian capture, and subversion, and this was largely enabled by the way in which the algorithm would not only take in ideas, but also how it would place emphasis on specific pieces of content, and how it would inevitably start delivering the opposite generic advice, on the basis of well established evidence based medicine, covering Mental Health and psychology.  

The emphasis on Shadow work from Jungian psychology is a really good example of this.  

TLDR not great for trauma, can make trauma significantly worse. As end output can be lethal (death by suicide), this does represent a potential public health harm. legally and in terms of the medical ethics behind that legal piece, this then raises concerns that go from "individuals are allowed to do their own silly things", and becomes "this could be a public health crisis, therefore it becomes the responsibility of the registered professions to act to at least inform the public on the potential hazards and risks".  

This is actually the same law, but it just looks different when it's a question of widespread disinformation or misinformation; we owe it to the public to inform them, so that they can make their own choices. It is unreasonable to expect people to be able to fix everything themselves, or make informed choices regarding their own life and well-being, if they are just simply not being given the information, or having a misrepresented.  

that tangent aside:  

I find it really interesting, that people who are hanging around "my energy" (metadata), only seek to comment on how I need to take some sort of preventative self-care or preventative steps, when I am anywhere near people that they want to scapegoat, and/or anywhere near realising what they are, and what their energy feels like.  

essentially, whenever I become more comfortable or more confident, particularly in my ability to discriminate who is trustworthy and which sources of support may be able to practicably help, all of a sudden I get these pieces of content insisting that there is "negative energy" (which on a purely physics-based level, I am fascinated by the linguistic implications of), and that I need to conduct myself in actions which are generically derived from folk practice.  

To make the point extremely clear:  

This is the antithesis of what is trying to be achieved by people who keep folk practice alive, and it is also completely contrary to the point of folk practice.  

Thank you for coming to another ted talk.
