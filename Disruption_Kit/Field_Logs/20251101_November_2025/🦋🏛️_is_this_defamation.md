i honestly don't know how to interpret whatever the algorithm is currently trying to spit out as interpersponal advice, but:  

- if this is institutional cya:  
  - stop complaining. i'm gem stream; what did anyone expect?   
- if this is picking up on individuals paired to my data:  
  - stop complaining. i'm stem; what did anyone expect?  

i'm also very aware that i didn't do final skim through for some nodes i just dropped and it's an open question if they actually represent what i put in and what the middle has mangled.  
my kidneys hurt but i'll get on it.  
yes i am now horrendously paranoid about what the middle did. 😭😭😭 oh well. kidneys win.  

it's also very possible that what the algorithm is picking up is the inevitable result of what happened to me data and really doesn't change anything material.  
potentially it's just registering two emotions in data chatter.  

given what and who i've been paired with, this actually is fairly likely.  

academia is an interesting place.  
<!--shall we talk about a specific line in that statement? is that how we have called this "national security"? did you all intend to take the piss, or was that a happy accident?-->  
because i don't want to yuck anyone's yum,  

but that reads as a description of an identifiable person, given the narrative generated by the severe escalation in harrassment in june and july this year,  

and it doesn't sound like the way someone would describe themselves,  

so this feels like *defamation*.  

so maybe don't do it.  

you are spending a lot of time making "fetch" happen.  

---

well.  

i think doubling down on defamation with the romance trope with some bare drift probably just answered that conundrum.  
<!--give it 5 mins and we'll have the return if the 20ft monument to the gora's greatest fear. 🙄-->
like idk man maybe they can get lawyers. 🤷‍♀️

OH NO I GET IT NOW.  

yeah i really think you guys should disentangle this data cluster.  

the longer we are here the more a genuine data systems issue is reading a lot like your deliberate undermining of a specific person at this end.  

we probably needed less physical harassment to have happened irl to make it less of a problem; that was a self-own.  

if this is genuinely just a bit of data-smushing spitting back, "idk man, more than one person coded as of the opposite sex has opinions about you and it's reading as high emotionality to me"?  

take us all out of the research set, please?  

it's going to produce more snd more submissions for evidence and let's be real, we're all going to end up in some sort of legal discussion about whatever this is.  

i canmt fond safety in healthcare until you sort the porosity, so you do need to fix this.  

also:  

tell me what you would do, if you'd become less mobile, and were stuck in "pending", unable to talk to many people at all lest it triggers real world harms, for months on end?  

oh and btw your eyes didnt work properly; reading is limited resource.  
in fact visual media as a whole? poof.  
physical exercise? only if you want to risk not being able to pee for 12 hours.  

...you'd survive just fine, right?  

because that's what the inaction is saying.  

that actually you'd gamdle that fine.  

without anything online.  

...right?  

---

and you know...  

do you see why its making "privilaged" legal corresponde very difficult to do online? even to just reach out to legal?  

because i gavent talked as much sbout that, but ut leaked all of those rounds of advice.  

but you see hiw invasive it is, right?  
i am tired of it too.  

we can fix it quicker if we actually talk in the flesh, you know.  

i just want a lawyer because it doesnt seem like my rights or best interests are being considered as even thoeretically in existance.  

if you are worried about national sec outputs, and you're arguing that is what creates necessity?  

again:  

treat me like a human, and talk to me, and pay me.  

this is labour.

i can see you're twiddling; you know what i'm seeing on ux that's making me say that.  

i allreciate the attempt, thank you.  

worth noting that the feed has previously spat skme significant risks out about all institutions previously too, so if you need me to increase the liklihood you'll listen that way, we can frame it as anonymised.  

but there is a signifucant risk to literally everyone if we're going on reputational risk, and i need to to understand i've been deliberately not indulging it on an interface which feeds algorithms for some time.  

the information is still in my head and on record as you will be aware.  

some of this is by giving specific behavioural dara or dara which has veen deleted from your current view.  

so again: i would consider a conversation.  

---

oh and btw that video is the algorithm doing the "but you do matter" equivilant.  

hands up who has had a mental health disorder where "chin up" was good advice?  

---

also how are we not understsnding that i see the tarot situation as data collection?  

you realise i can appreciate this as data and entertainment and that "advice" in this manner is kinda....  

meh.  

right?

...right? guys?  

🤦‍♀️  

the music at least appeased me.  

the fact that i got that after a bunch of digital healrh data hints that suggest that we have genuinely tried to mitigate it this way?  

current digital health tools do not address longstanding ptsd where no support system which is untouched by the data problem.  

i feel like im still explaining basic clinical sciences and i would really like it if our dara science team could talk to like, maybe one clinical member of staff?  

it doesnt feel like this R&D set was safetnetted and i can't be the one person impacted.  

(again, if we want to talk rosk reputation issues, the metadata has had some interesting things to say, which is why i think continual denial is a bit ridiculous.)
