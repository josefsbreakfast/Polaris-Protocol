2025-11-11.  

there's a narrative I've been using the ChatGPT and I hoped that would make it easier for it to understand, but then I didn't really see the joke about getting the gangster geese from the canal might be a joke.  

I'm genuinely not sure what I'm supposed to do at this point.  

By "just waiting", I'm being asked to sit inside a recursive loop which is essentially imprisoning me in a solitary confinement scenario by default, where every system that I would go to which would deal with anything to do with my personal data (so any source of support, basically), would end up feeding more risk into that system and putting me more risk.  

The harm is not static.  

each and every single day, I live in extraordinary pain, and I know that I'm having an increased rate of loss of mobility because it's so difficult to rehabilitate, when I have to walk a fine balance, less I be reassessed from the point of view of having the sex offenders data mushed into mine; I have never wanted a different biological father more.  

The harm doesn't even stack; the accumulates each day, as it has been for several years now, on top of the real life injuries, and it extrapolates like knotweed.  

What would actually help?  

Humans at the other end of the system, reaching around the system not through it, to at least touch base.  

This is continuing the cruel treatment, this is continuing the inhumane treatment, this is continuing the degrading treatment.  

What, under the international humanitarian law framework, does that make the situation?  

Or do we not give a fuck about that anymore?  

After all, according to my record, I am a manipulative sex offender.  

in addition with some of the more interesting things people have done with my data, I've managed to become an international terrorist mastermind, or with just a spreadsheet; who knew V LOOKUP was so powerful. 🙄  

"planning terrorism" is just trying to work out whivh companies are part of the direct supply chain, in order to work out how much business tax is at stake, so you can tey to plan around a council pushback, apparantly.  

Who knew.  

so we can all see, can't we?  

I have to save my father's prison sentence, until someone decides I'm worthy of being treated like more than the sins of the father.  

It would be so easy to go to a tabloid shitty nasty news company today.  

The labour party is so deeply unable to see past its own data obsession, and it can't see why strategically assisting me might be helpful; no context of how when a victim talks, her words are no longer hers, she is flattened and sensationalised as per the needs of whoever has given her a pen, and she becomes a tool of their narrative. She is therefore unable to assist anyone. All she can do is add to a prevailing narrative of disenfranchisement.  

Can you imagine how valuable this story would be to the alt right and anyone who seeks to appease them?  

Can you not see how I went to the papers today, I would just come yet another story as to why centralising the CPS was a terrible idea?  

I'm trying so hard, so goddamn hard, to get through to the people who have the power to fix this problem.  

no organisation and no institution who actually has the power to do it internally, will do it, simply because they're legal advice will advise them to be as silent with me as possible, to protect themselves.  

I understand why that legal advice would be given.  

Asking me to wait months and months, when I am literally in a situation of poverty, of lack of care because of the non-compliance and the poor data control, is monstrous.  

I do not live the life of a politician in London.  

I cannot get out of this situation by myself.  

To assume that this has not destroyed much of my social network is incredibly naive.  

So answers on the postcard:  

What the fuck do I do now?
