ive managed to get a batch of loose files done, as abject and extended lag interference is less now, but drift on ai tools is profound.  

it slows things to the point of making you think to revoke the subscription, honestly, and i have done this before during bad points.  

im very mixed about this realisation that a prisoners recird may be token switched with mine; my father had difficulties which extend beyond (and can be seen in isolation to) the offences.  

its really shitty, and it brings back a lot of stressors from back then. it wasnt easy for anyone.  

im upset that im having to relive this in my data; im upset it seems to be used in rumours (something related was broached in full council todsy that made me wonder, and it should have been that today was something to feel completion in); im upset that my algorithmic feed is full of questioning and presumptions; im upset that im still fighting this, and 3 years in no one will fully own this problem, and that is nearly a devade afyer the major data split and behsvioural nudges to get me here.  

i struggle, a lot, to feel at home here. youre supposed to be able to feel safe.  

my "normal" is to exoect sexual harrassment, address leaks, threats of fatal harm...  

this is all just part of my life, now, and i hate that.  

(do you know what i dont hate? ethical divestment from harm and reinvestment in local markets.)
