and i might be wuiet for a few dats because of it, because a signifucant amount of "not quite enough to see the doctor" things sre going wrong.  

these are the moments where i really feel alone, living without other humans.  

they are moments where even a small amount of help would help in leaps and bounds.  

re keysafe conundrum and stairs situation = why this is not possible.  

there is also just a strong semse of loss, in not being held for so long.  

we're a very tactile species, and its not that i don't adore the cats i live with, but there is something about being cocooned by someone who might not run under the sofa when there's a sharp knock at the door, that somehowe males a difference to the feeling of reletive safety.  

i really want to esvape from at least this area; this feels like being caged for 10 years.  

i know it is possible, but i recird the real world effects of the physical side of systemic neglect, because this will be real for so many people in the same position.  

"why not take time off?"  

because writing is one of a very small, not entirely strong pool of protective factors.  

so i have to balance what i have, to stay alive in all senses.
