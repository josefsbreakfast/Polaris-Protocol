at least we now all know  

why it was so difficult to place "bargain bin mossad"'s particular intelligence accent.  

(and why they merited the name.)  

not quite british,  

not quite israeli,  

not quite north america,  

but heavily influenced by us spy history,  

yet somehow blank when it came to the "red threat".  

close, colonial, anglophone...  

i could go on.  

we spent quite a lot of time getting to know the curves of my mind;  

did you not think i might learn all of yours?  
<!--and then so responsive to the clarifier as we poisoned the searches for my family records? rather revealing, i'd say.-->
