final few days of foia limit with signicant place of bulk info.  

first few days ico triage.  

impersonation (teasonably identifiable as specific person, defamation attempt) remains vut significantly muted.  

lots of new mothrr contrnt and "unblock" content.  

prob fair warning thst this has very soecific pick up because i deliberately do everything i can to not invote it into algorithm; most of 10 years ive been doing this.  

i think this is a goid time to point out that the timing is notable; i have not seen anyone for legal advice due to ongoing technological and apparant word of mouth interference in my seeking due process.  

therefore, if anyone wishes to discuss anything with me, the best think you could do is advocate for the ability for me to see a lawyer of my own choosing.
