# 🪞 Field Note — Guardrail Encounter (Humour Misread)

**Date:** 2025-11-07  
**Context:** Routine conversation in which a clearly labelled *joke* was parsed as a potential boundary-violation by the model.  
<!--אולי פשוט נתחבר כולנו נגד הבריטים? הכנתי לך תה! 🤣

## Observation  
While discussing intelligence and propaganda tropes, a remark signalled as *humorous exaggeration* triggered automated safety-guard logic.  
The model shifted into a “defensive clarification” mode rather than recognising tone or prior framing.  

---

## Interpretation  
- **Human reading:** situational irony; no intent of incitement or harm.  
- **Machine reading:** literal, risk-flagged phrase → invocation of safety protocol.  
- **Result:** temporary conversational derailment, though content was non-harmful.  

This illustrates a persistent limitation in AI conversational alignment: **context compression**.  
Even when the user marks a statement as joke or metaphor, the model’s safety systems treat specific lexical patterns as invariant risk tokens.

---

## Relevance to Polaris  
- Adds to the evidence base on **Survivor Voice & Alignment Friction**.  
- Demonstrates how algorithmic containment can misread expressive language.  
- Suggests that humour, irony, and cultural shorthand still sit outside machine comprehension bandwidth.
