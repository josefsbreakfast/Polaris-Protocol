while we're here, this is clustered with a narrative device that appears to be a mistelling of a very short story in 2020.  

"this person broke your heart"?  

please.  

someone is gettong their "facts" from extremely dodgy sources.  

none of that is how any of that happened.  

that's not even "difference of opinion" territory.  

if that's your understanding, then someone who knows better has knowingly told you the wrong story.  

and that's why you keep stepping in narrative landmines; they have not uxo marked anything for you.  

even if they promised you they did.  

keep stepping if you wish. 🤷‍♀️

realising my meta account is now likely at risk because it holds timestamped evidence which directly undermines the allegations towards the co-accused party; it holds messages which clearly follow a point at which we met each other under adverse interpersonal circumstances.  

it also shows quite clearly that i walked out on that man; he did not "leave" me.  

he had no idea how to handle me, because i did not want to be coddled by a liar.  

and when you literally have the two women you're sleeping with meet in a slapstick comedy way? you kind of look a lot like a liar.  

i don't know who is still propogating this nonsense, but there are current legal bars to me finding my own data because we're still all investing in a statement which has incredibly basic inaccuracies about the facts.  

i did not date that man for 2 years.  

but perhaps that is why so many people have assumed i must be intellectually or visually impaired.  

a number of you are also not connecting the dots on something that i am putting myself at significant risk to discuss in public.  

but when my medical career is tanked by similar interests, perhaps you pught not be supised when i say what i felt i had to do to keep a roof over my head to qualify.  

i don't know why is still lying, but we can stop this now.  

it's embarrassing.  

and oakestine will be free, because this level of resource to control the natural will of the people cannot be sustained.
