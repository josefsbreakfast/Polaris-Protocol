would someone with osa access in 2016 like to come and pick up their behavioural shaping model?  

i think its drunk; see screenshot.  

its far more incriminating in full, but i thought i'd be pleasent.  

(nb: im just not one of those people who likes pet names constantly. i find it suspicious, especially from a machine. its weird.)  

and either send me people who can code one of the easiest languages on the planet, or follow the admin guides as they have been provided.  

you can tell none of you have had to work a proper job before.  
<!--looked at pp148-9, erc; criticism is milk towst. i feel a lot of people benefit by not having all their eggs in one basket, when the minutae becomes more meaningful in one's mind than is perhaps warranted.  

amd the "we" thing is because i've soent a lifetime effectively in seevice jobs, in a givernment which is picking up corpspeak; mrs jones ismt supposed to know its just me and the inbox and i do wish you would stop sending people to ask me.  

i read around other diagnoses because i have a large anxiety around my fh (as i *am very sure* you are quite aware), and because the different techniques people use can be gelpful to mamage the condition thay i have which is "not cost effective to treat", thanks to that coalition cabinet we had.   

how can uyou blame me for being a little anniywd, when my future was used to oay for bankers' mistakes?  

and if this is why i' getting tye "soicy" cintent again, can we okese bloody stop?  

this is like the government sending me ohotos of its penis and i di not appreciate it.-->

oh dear g-d i know why my feed wont shut up abound beard mansgement now GET ME OUT OF THIS DIGITAL BOX PLEASE.  <!--ahhh. i see. yes, he does look like he could outgrow that in 6-8 weeks; this would grossly annoy me if i could even grow a beard. i did wonder where this insert was going; i assumed we were just genoursly misinterpreting a 5 o'clock shadow. don't know about the grumpy looks, though. maybe that's a special one just for you. 
speaking of grumpy looks and beards..  
you will be repairing my ease of access to shul. 
get to.
or should i ask why my case is not being nudged to prioritise, rarher than... what was your ohrase? "you have been deprioritised by the state"? something like this.  
kindly review that.  
i have a list if things which would appease me, and i'm sure orevisely zero will shock you by now.  
there's ab exceotiinalky easy way to shut me up tempirarily, but i doubt you'll enjoy tye idea, seeing as you've been cockblocking me for tye best part of a decade.  
in fact, should we talk about everything i've been nudged to?  
or would you prefer to get on with the list? -->

can we stop with the weird noise/peessure rocking against the structure please?  

i like gow the orientation chsnges as i searched fir the recording app but can we be vaguly normal and just shut it for a bit?

it would be nice if, bare minimum, we could agree to stop the guys who are doing the external environmental noxious stimuli, even if we don't want to consider more protective ways in which support and securoty cpuld be accessed.

i think i might upload that chatgpt convo later actually.  

it is truly a work of art, in sucking up to authority.  

incidently,  

we can put "overthinkers" merch in the feed,  

but why are you so upset that im writing?  

are we sure the error is with me?

although...  

🤣🤣🤣  

(and this is so dark, and it really is proof that the extent of my laugh-or-cry reflex is so deep.)  

Maybe the algorithm just knows so well what men under patriarchal systems are like,  

That even when the men around a woman's data tried to kill her so that no one else can have her,  

Or because her testimony would be inconvenient to him personally -- with some men, it really is a simple as I don't really want to go to court once, even for a ticket, I'll kill her. That's completely normal.  

Maybe the algorithm is so thoroughly exposed to all of you,  

And you've poisoned it so much,  

Just by being your goddamn selves without therapy,  

Because God forbid any of you would be vulnerable for two seconds,  

You can just get more women from somewhere, apparently. I'm sure that they're an infinite resource and they don't need cultivating over 20 years at least.  

(I really do worry what testosterone does to IQ.)  

Maybe the algorithm is just so well taught,  

There is soon as I start correcting it and outputting that data,  

The recursive logic of computing is telling me I'm overthinking.  

My delicate little girl brain is using words of more than five letters.  

The delicate little flower princess is thinking about things outside her own little tower.  

How dare she?  

After all,  

As we can see,  

The man who have clearly got everything under complete control.  

That's why we're essentially living in World War II and no one's admitting it wearing a constant state of economic depression and there is a real concern. The governments across the world are collapsing like cardboard.  

"Darling, would you like a hand?"  

Although I feel it has gone a little too far. 🙄  

that said, I would prefer we don't burn our own house down.

I would like to formally ask the cabinet to reconsider the concerns that were buried in 2022; I would like us to reopen the concerns from the whistleblower, who apparently was the only one in the room with either the common sense or the balls to raise the fact that this is apart from morally wrong, a huge security concern longterm, and could only possibly be in the intelligence communities interest if we were to misinterpret IPA and protect non-British assets on British islands above British citizens.  

I have a lot of bones to pick with the book, and I do find his face frustrating, but on this particular point, I will concede agreement.  

Not just for myself; this was an extreme error of judgement by the conservative government, and this was probably based on inaccurate or incomplete security advice; given what is happening to sunak, it does not appear to have been a unanimous decision, and i dont think white british commentators appreciate how people sitting that proximal to that industry and wealth *are* british assets (underutilise it you wish, but it's a stupid choice to).  

Or we were sucking up to people who are no longer deemed trustworthy by the public.  

Better to level the score before the match is rained off; the rain here is rather unpredictable, no? And we are out at the summer months; we no longer have Hindustan to retreat to.  

this can also change gow much we will pay in "forgiveness money" in the icj, so i really think we ought to dig it up, embarrassing though it is.  
those assets are not protected by ipa; ours are, and our citizens are our best ones.

<!--goof to see you're putting slightly less insert into the musoc; i can tell when it doesn't make sense for a real person, and you're not matching on the taste quite right. please stop condensing a continent that is bigger than ours, and a diaspora with a rich british herotage. this is embarassing. please stop being That White Guy. can see why sunak want keen.-->
