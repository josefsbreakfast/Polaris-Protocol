i have well over 50 if not over 100 nodes in progress.  

The cause of this is not me.  

This is what I mean when the technical slowness and the technical errors causing interference and mistakes, really stack up.  

you can see that this is the week starting on the ninth, so the earliest I would've made this folder on the eighth.  

I think I moved about four of these over from last week, because that's where I've managed to catch up to (and how much interference I'd managed to overcome).  

We're now looking at 50 to 100 documents in queue over a few days, because that's how bad it is.  

I will say that some of these are gonna be really short about 100 or 200 words? some are more like essays.  

This has been what my life has been like since 2016.  

I've been in touch with the ICO today, just to get reference numbers and map things out; the current waiting time is 29 weeks before anything even gets attached to a case manager.  

I've been in touch with the MOD and the MOJ, has chaser emails, with a very messy chaser to MP.  

This is absolutely exhausting.  

A real frustration is that you're just expected to endlessly wait until your life can keep going; whoever and whatever processes have tied me up like this, have literally grounded my life to a halt until this is fixed.  

It's really frustrating, but it feels like nothing can really happen or be done, and a lot of that stuff with the ICO, looks a lot like institutions being told by lawyers not to comment.  

This is so frustrating.  

Everything about my data is keeping me in a box like a child sex offender, like a terrorist, until someone goes in and manually correct things.  

it really feels like it just doesn't matter what you bring to the table, you're expected just to sit there and be taken from, presumably until you die.  

Every institution in every organisation is so boot strapped for cash, that essentially nothing matters; no one is allowed to care, as that would be inefficient.  

I really don't want anyone to tell me that this is my fault or that I need to improve my state of mind.  

I have been the cheerleader for everyone else for so long.  

i'm really tired now.  

What I need is other people not even to cheerleading Me, but just to actually do the bare minimum procedural items.  

Even if that means getting through the rest of the workload, and they never touch my case.  

We've all been running on fumes since 2010.  

Covid made it so much worse.  

And a big part of me wishes that any of the people you were responsible, person since she tanking the world that I would walk into as an adult, made the bare minimum payback.  

that's not really a revenge fantasy.  

It's just feeling like the social contract isn't being honoured.
