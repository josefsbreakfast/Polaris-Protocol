chaps ive already said this.  

you have to go ketoconazole 2% for a limited period, and then maintainence with the 1%.  

you have to give the protein structure of the hair a rest or it will degrade; given what else is in the recs, im going to suggest you give it a rest.  

guideline is on nice and in the bnf. standard dandruff schedule; its practicalky always a slight overgrowth of pretty ordinary skin colonising microbes. please just listen to dermatologists or pharmacists for like 2 seconds.  

and for goodness sake h&s is not what to supplement with it you want to retain hair in this situation. use something moisture-preserving.  

now stop googling it and get out of my recommends.
