something that's really annoying is that I've got a few really key things that I need to get across in the current series of FOIA uses, where disappears to have taken something that was stopping people from reporting the entire case to least reporting something.  

I'm a little bit worried about the fact that I've got this like stomach bug and I'm not really able to concentrate very well and physically quite ill and I don't really have that safeguarding in yet; because everything in area is touched by at least one risk channel of data transfer which is already identified as the results of foia returns, I'm trying to keep myself safe in the general community, but my goodness I'm so sore and so tired 🤣🤣  

Whatever that feeling is for when you really really feel that you need a break? And a nice hotel? I have already reached that point. 🤣.
