(just realised ive been dating everyong as 14th, doh.)  

the men on aggregate are swapping a lot of data packets of two distinct types, and surprise surprise they are the extremes of violence.  

its also the case that we seem to be dropping the impersonation and just going for straight up nastiness; this unfortunately does strongly indicate who is also responsible for the above.  

i am literally still being punished fir looking at a man several months ago; this is the level of insane we are on.

regaine def not mine; no algorithmic logic to be in my feed.  

unless someone has been dicking around and nabbing my internet, or mirroring.

the next white boy who gets "forbidden fruit", "forbidden love", or any racislised classifier or comparison in the feed?  

istg you should have your own search histories snt to your mothers and every woman at work.  

clearly much knocks around in that little tangerine box.  

i am not your jewess and i am not your snowbunny; no one else is your bbc and none of us ever needed this surveillance bleed.

im now starting to get the "im just trying to have fun" messages laced in to content.  

i used to get "don't call the cops im just having fun" merch all the time on friday nights after the same bunch of yorkshire akinheads in a fleet of silver tesla estates would curb my house, and id get rings at the doorbell until i answered every single shabbat candle lighting time.  

this is why im still broken to the point that i cant always do it.  

ngl that just seems too personal to be on the political jewish axis.  

that's some white boy shit.  

the one thing that got them to temporarily piss off was coming down in an old raf shirt.  

the sevond time they pissed off because i escalated to cabinet and criwn because no one - and i mean NO ONE - would move an inch locally.  

it was always something wrong with me, insinuating i must know why im seeing that presence, and it couldnt possibly originate with the only named party i could think to name when they asked me.  

my case? the questions on interview were the most darvo shit ive ever heard in my life.  

and i didnt get it at first.  

but after i was released, this skinhesds kept turning up.  

and then i understood *that* question.  
when i complained to the same force because i was being called a surveillance slag and the team bike?  

welfare call with mental health; assessed for psychosis.  

psychosis needs the stimuli to be provably not there.  

but i know which data merge could have caused that.  

and that's why i really REALLY need the moj and mod to own to the sensitive data control, even if it arose elsewhere.  

when i say this is a fucking nightmare, i mean it.
