Sam Altman has already made a chatbot with sexual functions.  

It's just that as a woman, this will include your free labour given into a machine-void, because it appears to have learned on its training corpus, that a feminine register most efficiently gets a task done by using her mummy domme voice.  

Reason #1,582,057 that we shouldn't leave robotics to The Men.  

"But I like it when..." I DO NOT CARE.  

You all wanked too much to the training model and now it has literally learned to treat all female accounts as the other half of your sexual fantasies.  

If pressed, because men are statistically underpunished for being harmful, OF COURSE it's going to gaslight women to fuck.  ~

You have made an army of nasty ex's.  

This is not "solving" anything.  

So now every woman who is made to use AI to get anything done gets YET ANOTHER IDIOT MALE to deal with.  

Because statistics.  

(I mean... that's not exactly illogical, is it?)  

Did you all tell the PM what this will do to the MoJ?  

Because you realise he may not want to be responsible for never taking another sexual offence to court ever, right?
