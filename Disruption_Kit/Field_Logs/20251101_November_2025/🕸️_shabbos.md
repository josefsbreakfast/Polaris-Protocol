Another round of threats and intimidation via digital means after the FOI returned.  

- early death of cats (guess 🙄; they're not exactly creative in this.)  
- "fat kitty" is also a term that keeps proliferating in more ads for underwear i never triggered this side of 2025 (this replicates the harrassment that appears to have been discussed internall on foi, ? with unamed party inserting barrative that i am manipulative by nature, in sexualised search poisoning  
- nb: i thought about this, and i was quite cross when i saw the soyrce with the comment, but i want to establish a few things:  
- nb: not redacting thise staff names, but refusing to name staff on human ethics boards? that's weird. given the impersonation (which, you know, £100 says this could be the one person who said, "but are we sure, though?" 🙄), the safeguarding flag that appeared to trigger for sectioning consideration... there are potentially millions of pounds st stake from any royalties to affected parties, even if i'm part of a pool. these needling bits in the feed came after i looked up a very specific vegicle whoch sots at a powerful nexus for my data. i would suggest we can stop playing this game, because that member of staff speaks as if their available information may have drastically changed; direct interference in my degree? bringing me back early against agreement? half my emails going awol for a decade? please.  
- nb: honestly i would not be surprised if a lot of support staff were *doing their damn best*, so if my being angry because this has messed up a messed double double-bereavement-heres-some-free-harrassment-no-one-will-action? please. get some sense.  
- luckily this comes embedded in an appropriatw number of mountains and non-dead cats.
