using ml envirnoment to navigate cs concept.  

tone and syntax changed with weord deviation from logic at same time as auth failure on azure ad level of uni address.  

the uni address fails are now timed exclusively to jailbreaks.  

i would query if this is someone doing something they know they shouldnt be doing.  

? sec issue ticket as bug reported to openai.  

sogning off for a bit.  

shame; the cs concept and how it links with frankenstack in uk metadata space is v interesting.  

the chat talked such agentic narcisstic horseshit. i really widh whoever this was got their permissions revoked. theyre fucking annoying.  

(clone/split/twin/ghost/frankenstack = all very bog standard data science language.)
