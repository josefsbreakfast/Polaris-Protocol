yeah.  

i think the impersonation may need to stop leaking/inserting narrative.  

im going to cluster this under "healthcare related appointments" as a disclose caregory. last 48 hours.  

it very much looks like a previouslky held assumption updsted with guardrails out of these notes on polaris, but still yielding incorrect circumstances.  

so i just wanted to pass on that there are some invented health appointments of another person in this, and maybe we can ask our colleagues to stop doing this please.  

i am clearly holding myself back from ripping into the idea of this as somehow effective ct work; clearly some of the medical ethics pronciples are still in the head box somewhere.
