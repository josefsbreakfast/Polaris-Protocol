the reason i use "brothers":  

- 1st example of metadata poisoning of jewish liturgy of notice to me.  

- for all the harrassment that was engaged with by others, all of the deliberate old school secosm and antisemitism to be shocking, for all the racialised charactatures and everything thst went with that...

you missed a key ingredient to make it convincingly british antisemitism.  

this also made it seem a lot more likely to be influenced by at least one jewish member, maybe a vague consulting opinion, and as those are commonly anonymised or plural:  

acheinu.  

and you know i can joke about it and you apparantly cannot, which apoarantly is A Problem.  

get a sense of humour, please.  

or at least let us not run from the key characteristic that the antisemitic profiling always missed.
