if someone is "tinkering" with chatgpt here and there? kindly do not.  

i am trying to get it to process simple decision trees to help during post and status migrane events, and it keeps making stuff up and inserting irrelevent or incorrect information; not very *we value all our people* of you.  

it particularly annoys me when its clear logic errors because this is just maths but with more letters; it should not be fucking this up.  

as we have already literally physically isolated me, taken away the bulk pf accessible services, and divested necessary care in-region, please let me use the internet to blow off steam?  

and stop trying to make me forget what hapoened in the may, june, july periods this year, and the aug to dec period last year.  

this was not "just" a systems error; it is a choice to stalk and sexually harass women, and a badge or a piece of paper doesn't actually make it "better". quite the opposite.
