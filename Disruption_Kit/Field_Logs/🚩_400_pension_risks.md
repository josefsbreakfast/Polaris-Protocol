some people call them husbands.  

i beg to differ.  

putting aside legality...  

is disclosure ethically wrong?  

is it not simply what is *right*?

i have known for some time, now.  

and you still will not negotiate in good faith.  

tell me...  

what does a woman in my position even have to lose?  

enough daily clones makes it one tap.  

i need to know why i ought to refrain.
