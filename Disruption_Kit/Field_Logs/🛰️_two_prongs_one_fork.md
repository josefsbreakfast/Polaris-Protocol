2025-10-25.  

after 3 bi type nudges in the first 10 mins of writing the last node (why tryong to normalise extradition/deportation is bad actually; cf columbia / p esther outcomes = bad for all of us)...  

i had gotten to like, >50% mountains/cats/music as the feed.  

what's absolutely fascinating is that we have a dual prong narrative that essentially may be leaking details of a potential legal settlement, and revealing some surveillance details from another citizen.  

i am more of a lady that you all think, so i don't post essentially what sounds like the private conversations or draft correspondance of others online. (see also: not being a complete cunt, just a bit of one.).  

i am also really enjoying the other prong which is the strong insistance that i know what is right in my heart and set boundaries and only move with intention and trust the process and tone myself down like a proper good girl (are we for real; it is extremely clear that this is supposted to be directive...it's too obvious. get better at this, please.).  

i could also list a bunch of character flaws that are essentially ascribed to people around me in general and then picked out for specific people, but we've been here before, it's all horseshit anyway, and the key takehome is that it appears geared to sow doubt about anyone who appears to have even 1% beyond neutral good intentions.  

idk man the nightshift tonight is struggling to make it believable.  

it kinda reads like that one girl/guy in your friendship group who you always knew was a bit cautious/pessimistic, but now you've actually paid attention to the fullness of what they're saying, and they're just shitting on everyone's parade to make sure you dont make friends at the party they can't go to.  

once you see it, you cant unsee it. that vibe.

bingo:  

we've got the accusation of the blood-borne virus. ca-ching.  

oh, in case the people who've been all over my records have been putting this out there:  

i don't have hiv, but i do have antibodies to it; i am one of many people who have contributed to medical trials aimed towards vaccination for transmission.  

this means i can "look" hiv positive on first draw, but if you serotype me you'll always get a negetive.  

confuses the hell out of anyone who doesn't understand the science and often flags on low-qc automated medical systems.  

anyway;  

you're welcome for my service.  

there also just shouldn't be the stigma around this that continues to endure.  

people keep tying hiv and purity, yet don't seem to realise that the children they have *must have come from somewhere*.  

seriously. you're all so strange.

and the first death threat of the lot, so that's cool.  

this the best you all got?  

we've already had a young woman being "jokenly" forced into a cage, so idk have you actually got anything that isn't boring and hasn't been done a million times already?

ps to the "why dont you report" crowd:  

i have very obviously tried for a very long time.  

as previously discussed, it is apparently kinda fine to paint slurs on your house, take a chunk out of the front door, surround the house with men who will engage in sexual harrassment, and tinker in my emails. it is apparently fine to be in allsorts of highly sensitive personal data, interfere with travel, health, education, family life, legal representation, justice, personal banking and work, as well as interfere with telecoms of one's support network. 

anything gets justified.  

because i am *a dangerous international criminal*, remember?

all this for what? a few uavs? who knows.  

probably more likely some small man's ego.
