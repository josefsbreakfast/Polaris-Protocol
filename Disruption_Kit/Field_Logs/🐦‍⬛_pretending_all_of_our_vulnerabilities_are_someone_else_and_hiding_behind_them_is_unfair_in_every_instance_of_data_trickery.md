i appreciate white supremacy snd apartheid does some weird things to the brain but can we stop doing this?  

its not hugely respectful to the user id you are hiding behind.  

whether in an R&D "i got inti the uk version of the pentagon" or otherwise.  

(getting in is cool, i agree, and no i dont think that historical case was handled well, and indtances like that are the reason you get confused by my feelings and opinions on carcerality.)  

(idk man i kinda feel like sentencing any teenagers is universally a condemnstion of is as grownups. its extremely rare that it isnt.)  

i also appreciate that this is essentially habitual at this point and probably a stress coping behaviour.  

that is why we need to engage with the other grown ups, or, until we are ready for that:  

Get.  

To.  

Work.  

im sure such a genius mind can find a way to not piss me off quite so much.  

and id love to pretend this isnt part of my motivation, but a significant aspect is your refusal to take on board the fact that i just dont think that that particulsr academic figure gave off "let me explain my genitals to some woman via the romance of memes" energy.  

so stop being weird and preyending to be him, and based on previous leaks, stop going through his internet and banking records.  

he also wasnt giving "allow me to swallow your soul via your own genitals like a dementor" vibes, either.

literally the power to take down a global movement that dgaf about you is *right there*.  

if you must know, im holdong off explaining that "actuslly the german public situation and wider collaboration vs actual giving-a-shit-about-holocaust (largely no, but also more than typically ascribed) was highly complicated".  

humams are complicated. you are not the first to realise. that means youre in good compamy.  

welcome to the real dark side.  

the cookies are less consistsnt, but fuck me the sugar is far better.  

fuck that overly refined shit.
