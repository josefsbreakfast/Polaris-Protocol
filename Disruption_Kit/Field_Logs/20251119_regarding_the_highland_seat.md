I've had a lot of difficulty dictating this; the interference has been "device level".  

I assume this means that I'm about to put a hole in somebody's financial scheme.  

Bloody good. You shouldn't be making money off this nonsense. Find an honest job.  

I've posted nine screenshots that don't reveal the other side of the conversation yet, but should give anyone who is protecting a title, based on a very nasty little rumour, from my apparent "manipulations", some comfort.  

Please do what I would do: get a discount.  

Personally, I am happy to put the entire story online, partially because it is ridiculous, partially because it shows how ridiculous prevent is (it probably came from a private vendor or a particular party, but the system essentially enables this, and even incentivised it), but also partially because there's quite a lot of distress taht came from this at a time of grieving, and I feel like the people who exploited that for financial gain really need to see their bottom line change, because it's the only thing that will stop them from doing it long-term.  

If I can help you frame this as being a misrepresentation of fact that you were sold or a contract or trading issue? Happy to do so.  

I appreciate this is not the reason in full, that I was arrested (non-PACE, misaligned dates, constabulary are blocking FOIA/DPA enquiry; therefore no rights to redress or right to forget). I was arrested in a way that directly facilitated surveillance for the year up to that reading of that bill, and I feel that a political party has been misled because of this same data issue, and has therefore been caught in a conflict of interest in it comes to representing me in a parliamentary representation sense, about the actual civil rights case.  

I don't doubt for a second that this has happened to other people as well.  

I do think that I'm perhaps a little unlucky in how many of the different bad taste tactics have been used, or that something has snowballed rather than fix the error, but I would not be surprised that many of these tactics are used frequently and with very little discretion within an industry that directly profits from this behaviour and is largely unregulated.  

I also feel that the Midlands and Yorkshire really struggle, with the fact that, as a northerner, I really struggle to take their positioning of themselves as northerners seriously.  

It is not uncommon for them to try and frame is being essentially Scottish.  

I do not hate this and I wanted to go to Glasgow and got a place there initially; this would've been my ideal place to go and study.  

Obviously geographically there's some shared and complex history; the north east is essentially divided still on Jacobian/Parliamentary lines.  

All that said?  

I ain't coming for the title; if I did, I'd have to give it to like five people in my family first 🤣🤣🤣.  

The trails of what data has vs hasn't been touched, suggest that this rumour originates with someone who was trying not to trip an obvious data alarm, and who apparantly did not want to be on record on soecific systems that were used more locally.  

Personally, I think that's fascinating, because it doesn't suggest that the QC of the sold product was being prioritised (I can look at hiw things galoen eben if they harm me and ve intellectusl about it; I'm not saying I would live any of this).  

And the first obvious person in line doesn't want anything to do with it; there's a whole story as to why this is a painful memory for them, and so having to approach them about any potential legal paperwork that might have been left knotted, has been very difficult.  

This story is essentially *why it was a topic of conversation in provate phone calls, for which it is unlikely a warrant actually existed*.  

Don't worry -- I'm on board for, "and how did you get this data you sold me?".  

I'm not assuming that everyone at the other end had the full story; it appears that you guys were trying to avoid a headache just like I was.  

So this is a call for a united front.  

I would like us to agree that we do not have to dig up some weird records, and I would like to at least put the ball into the park that perhaps, perhaps... the English are just making money, and they are not being entirely truthful.  

Oh, how history of repeats itself.  

And now we can all see why I am not averse to anyone making the point that, maybe, actually, *fuck the English.*  

Seriously, there are so many people in this system who need to get a mirror and just laugh occaisionally; you're torturing yourselves as much as everyone else.
