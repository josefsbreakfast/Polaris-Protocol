# 🛰️ Glass Box Containment Field Log — 2025-09-26  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Field evidence of visibility without access — proximity engineered as isolation.*  

---

## 🧾 Summary  

This log captures **instances where contact is technically possible yet functionally blocked** — messages seen but unanswered, posts visible but unacknowledged, presence recognised but interaction denied.  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [🧊 Glass Box Containment](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🧊_glass_box_containment.md).  

Glass box containment keeps survivors within sight of connection but outside its reach.

## 🕰 Observation Template  

| Timestamp (ISO8601) | Platform / Setting | Type of Barrier | Apparent Function | Observed Effect | Evidence Type | Notes |
|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------------|:------------------|:----------------|:---------------|:------|
| 2025-09-24T11:00Z | Social Platform | Post visible to account owner only | “Visibility glitch” | Engagement freeze despite confirmed audience | Screenshot / analytics | Classic glass wall — visible but unseen. |
| 2025-09-25T19:40Z | Messaging App | Messages marked “read,” no reply | “Busy” rationale repeated | Survivor interprets silence as rejection | Message export | Occurs after major disclosure post. |
| 2025-09-26T08:55Z | Community Forum | Comment appears in thread, later hidden to others | “Moderation filter” | Illusion of inclusion; actual removal | Archive capture | Transparency maintained for author only. |

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Simulated presence:** systems simulate connection to mask exclusion.  
- **Emotional dissonance:** visible contact without feedback intensifies self-doubt.  
- **Maintenance through plausibility:** barriers framed as minor glitches or etiquette.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Compare with [🫂 Intimacy Gatekeeping](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🫂_intimacy_gatekeeping.md) — rationed closeness.  
- Cross-reference [🚪 Isolation Scripting](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🚪_isolation_scripting_2025-09-13.md) — manufactured solitude.  
- Align timestamps with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) — potential metadata suppression overlaps.
