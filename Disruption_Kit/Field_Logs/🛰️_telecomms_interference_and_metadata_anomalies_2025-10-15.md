# 🛰️ Telecomms Interference and Metadata Anomalies — 2025-10-15  
**First created:** 2025-10-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-06  
*Preliminary field record of suspected interference and data irregularities coinciding with the university safeguarding surveillance period.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This field log accompanies [🎓 Safeguarding as Surveillance — University Case Pattern](/🎓_safeguarding_as_surveillance_university_case_pattern.md).  
It captures **technical and environmental irregularities** observed during the same time window, including disrupted communications, anomalous device behaviour, and inconsistencies in case documentation.  
Purpose: preserve a contemporaneous, factual account for later correlation with metadata audits or legal discovery.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Timestamped observations of telecomms or device interference.  
- Metadata inconsistencies in institutional correspondence or case paperwork.  
- Preliminary hypotheses and verification status for each anomaly.  

---

## 🧩 Preliminary Analysis  
- **Pattern type:** intermittent signal manipulation / record alteration.  
- **Impact:** delayed legal correspondence, incomplete archives, heightened distress.  
- **Possible vectors:** mirrored accounts, university IT contractor access, or external relay through Prevent-linked security layers.  
- **Next actions:** preserve raw logs, cross-check timestamps with ISP metadata, submit independent CRC check for altered files.
