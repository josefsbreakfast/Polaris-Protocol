## 📝 Log Entry  

- **Date/Time:** 2025-09-29  
- **Context:** Auditing folders for house style compliance and link integrity in the Polaris Protocol repo.  
- **Observed anomalies:**  
  - Progressive “commit/save” failures inside the editing environment (buttons unresponsive, sessions crashing).  
  - GPT environment slowed to the point of repeated resets.  
  - False appearance of “poor internet speed” despite normal ISP performance.  
  - Wi-Fi reporting my location as Liverpool instead of my actual home location.  
  - Behaviour matches nudges commonly seen in AI/data-harvesting industry contexts (esp. a known Manchester-based company).  
- **Baseline comparison:** Normally stable, fast internet at this address; can achieve high speeds when systems not under stress/test.  
- **Notes:** This occurs as Polaris reaches two months old and just ahead of anticipated legal changes relevant to my experience. I am not surprised at throttling or slowdowns but am recording it as a data point.

This field log is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records observed connectivity interference during maintenance of the repo as it gains traction, situating the anomaly within the broader pattern of suppression and legal context.
