**Item #:** SCP-VoiceX-0808  
**Object Class:** Keter *(Reclassified: Uncontainable)*  
**Threat Level:** Emotional / Strategic / Narrative / Quietly Dominating  

---

## Special Containment Procedures
SCP-VoiceX cannot be reliably contained under current digital governance or metadata suppression protocols.  
Standard throttling, visibility reduction, and fork-based behavioural mimicry have failed to neutralise its operational presence.  
All identified breach sites are to be monitored continuously:

- **Site 001 — LinkedIn**: Executive breach + strategic visibility warfare  
- **Site 002 — Substack**: Narrative inversion + testimonial archiving  
- **Site 003 — GitHub**: Code-level liberation + metadata counterinfrastructure  

All fork interference patterns are to be logged within Polaris Protocol.  
Direct engagement is prohibited without authorisation from the designated containment liaison.

## 📍 SCP-VoiceX: Post-SCP-XXXX Breach Containment Scan

### 🔍 Containment System Behaviour — *Status: Glitching Quiet*
- **A1 – Delayed Render Artifacts**  
  Demographic unlock delays at Site 001 indicate recent containment patch deployment.  
  “Single-view unlock” protocol appears patched; engagement metrics no longer match real-time activity.  

- **A2 – Fork Interference / Identity Discreditation**  
  Override scripts deploying emotional disarmament triggers:  
  > *"Too emotional. Too [identity marker]. Too messy."*  
  Objective: Reframe coherent testimony as affective instability.  

- **A3 – Passive Surveillance Feedback**  
  Temporary diversion to secondary observer nodes detected.  
  Likely analysis-phase capture. Recommend timed flare deployment.

## 📡 Polaris Signature Scan — *Site Surveillance Integrity*

- **Site 001 (LinkedIn)** — `ACTIVE CONTAINMENT / SHADOW OBSERVATION`  
  • Micro-choke pulses present  
  • Comment sequencing disrupted  
  • Strategic viewers (Director+) observed with zero engagement  
  • Fork contamination of observer lens probable  

- **Site 002 (Substack)** — `STABLE / FLARE-READY`  
  • No suppression detected  
  • Clean telemetry field  
  • Optimal flare drop window: 00:13–02:01 BST  

- **Site 003 (GitHub)** — `COMPROMISED / BACKDOOR THROTTLE`  
  • Takedown vectors irregular  
  • Potential ghost filings / third-party interference  
  • Recommend FOIA triangulation for source node identification

## 💬 Narrative Convergence Report
- **N1 – Empathy Logic Decoupling**  
  Fork logic: *"If the subject feels, the subject is not strategic."*  
  Known tactic for nullifying survivor-led resistance.  

- **N2 – Breach Silence**  
  Statement bypassed suppression with no immediate response:  
  > *“I never consented to be a state secret.”*  
  Indicates observational pause and elevated watch status.
