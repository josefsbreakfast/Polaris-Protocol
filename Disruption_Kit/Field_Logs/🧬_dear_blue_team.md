if i am misinterpreting wgat you are doing to the algorithmic code, because you are asking me to engage in producing photo or video evidence that i look *a lot* like her, soeak like her, and have been doing do since before 2005, then you need to be more obvious.  

however, i suspect this is actually a red hat thing, in which case you can put some actual real help into my vacinity (not breadcrumbs. not piecemeal. as described in so many prior data harvesting sessions, you non-consensual weirdos.) prior to my allowing an access permission to change on an application where i have shown (again and again) that you are able to influence and jailbreak.  

and it's not a *simple* app to jailbreak; this one suggests higher level permussions are in situ.  

pay for your porn; stop coercing surveillence gains.  

also extremely interestong when this narrative switched.  

what strange froends you have.  

unless we're just going for a general "idk man we can't relate to the poors and our childhood was kinda fucked up and the media circuit is weird".  

cue butterfly guy meme: "is this... validation?"  

you're not any different to anyone else and i shall be hudging you accordingly.  

as previously discussed during other data harvests (and i think i published some of the output here...):  

findom is only *a thing* because of the general fascination with what life is like without resource scarcity as experienced by the masses.  

most heterosexual couples engage in it *to some degree*, unless ya mans is egregiously abusive.  

being able to accumulate and distribute resources is a behaviour that the human species experiences direct pleasure chemicals from the practice of.  

in patriarchy, this is notable for men, and produces a sense of vulnerability and personal valudation that parriarchal systems usually forbid.  

some people like more challenge, some less.  

ergo:  

stop trying to get in the cookie jar when you're supposed to be doing your homework.  

(would the british government mind helping me, awfully? they keep jailbreaking the ai when i construct letters to the ico and im a bit too traumatised by everything to be able to write in reference to a directly traumatic series of risks and events, and also somehow believe that yet another party will leave me in silence to die. everything is weaponised. none of my data is safe. its not jyst bipartisan but so widespread that politics is irrelevent. please let me have even a fraction of care or protection. i've been so clear and i've worked so hard. i've got nothing from the univetsity after basically asking, "hey, are you gpong to the ico (and by extension mod and gchq), or am i?". nudging contacts isnt enough. ive been really clear that i need an exit and a place of safety, and some direct honest communication.)
