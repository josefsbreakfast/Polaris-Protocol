i've tried uploading photos to show what I'm getting in my meta data feed that is not mine.  

However, it keeps getting blocked so I'm just going to be very clear:  

Intermittently it looks like someone is trying to use proxy data, to create a narrative that it is a particular woman who is stalking me. She is not stalking me. I know she is not stalking me because she can't do the kind of things that are being done on a technical level. This also does not reflect the kind of content that she would look at. This an impersonation of a woman, in order to mask who is doing the stalking and harassment, occasionally uses things which seem very idiosyncratic for her. When I say they seem idiosyncratic? Only if you've never met her, and only know one thing about her. it's a very "surface level" impersonation.  

If it is the case that she's looked at my profile once, I can't exactly blame her because we'll get recommended to each other, because that's what TikTok does when you've spoken to someone; I get way more recommends for other people.  

It's probably notable to say that the first person I ever had recommended to me when my account was being broken into on TikTok (a different account which I am now locked out of), there was one man who was recommended.  

I think it's safe to say that that man is far more likely to be the person who is using technological means or access to people who have technological means, to conduct some of this harassment.  

I'm also not saying it's definitely him because I can't actually see the hard evidence, mostly because no one will give certain fois or sars to me, in accordance to the law.

I also know that none of the men who are outside my house? We're very feminine presenting women.  

So that in and of itself, means that what I'm going through is not from one woman.  

I have given permission for that person in their family to contact me so it is not "manipulative" or "non-consensual".  

What is manipulative and non-consensual?  

Someone going through records which are tied to defence data at 3am, and pressuring local stakeholders to keep quiet.  

That is manipulative. That does not have consent.

and seeing as I'm aware of what might be something we don't want to talk about online, all I will say is that the pattern of material does not match a woman, whether het/bi/coded as either; the pattern is statistically more aligned with male gaze sexualisation.

and while it is not the case that I have logs, which say yes, it is explicitly one person, I find it really interesting that no one in law enforcement or in safeguarding architecture locally, even entertains the idea of questioning if it's that person that I've already named.  

When I worked in childrens care and healthcare, it wasnt a political thing. you just rearranged the shift to PROTECT THE ACCUSED PERSON AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE and did the referrals.  

im not saying it wasnt super stressful. im saying you just **did the job**.  

and then either way? job done.
