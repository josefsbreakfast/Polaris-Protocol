a lot of things from yesterday really made my head gnaw.  

something i am considering is just how "inside" the labour party the unwanted presense in my metadata got, how much it was relying on boring policy being defaultto being useful by comparison, how much it was desperate to remain hiding behind jews to justify surveillemce investmsnt and access in the midlamds, and how much trouble *previsely* it stirred up in that institutional exposure, in its obsessive projection onto brown men in particular.  

it's not an unusual set of motivations: a number of political sidelines actors are this way inclined.  

im just not not sure i can see why the effort was worth it; it seems like a lit of risk and a lot of complication when one could soend the same effort just being really good at something useful.

(given that ghosts wre the core of whatever this is/waa, its easier to just talk about it as a sort if composite personality; precise nature and intent is kess relevant ti ke than, "siiiiigh.... who do i have to foia next 🙄")
