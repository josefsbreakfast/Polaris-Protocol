re all this in kpunk/banned book node --

"UKIP kept were also practically forced on them to [elect] by a political media so decadent, so boring, that it counts Nigel Farage as a charismatic flash of colour."

"The only party that could call on a massive popular enthusiasm in the UK was the SNP. That popular enthusiasm -- an enthusiasm that capitalist realism is set up to prevent emerging -- is the rushing in of something that, for a long time, that hasn't seem to be any glimmer of in England: the future."

cf:

"Nor can you really blame people for being attracted to the type of politician who assures them that these problems are not of their making but a product of 'elites', 'immigrants' and globalisation -- because if we are honest, in most cases, these problems really were not of the making of the ordinary people who suffered them."

"This turn in the political tides will not affect just ordinary individuals."

it's not one specific line or one specific party, that catches a data nexus point that is of concern to both industry and political actors.  

it's catching a key part, a catalyst point, a something that is absolutely necessary for the wider system to work, to survive, and for a very specific grup of exploitation behaviours to continue.  

all c&c's will hit on other "red flags" around that, but there's a very specific bit that they hit on, and they all code as being able to translate that well to a broad key audience.  

it's so binary that it would be easy not only to identify it from the produced communication, but also to predictabley score on internet use and reading and behavioural patterns and the transformational cycles represented as emotions played out in cyberspace.  

then all you need to do...  

make sure they stop talking.

the difficulty in this comes from the fact all individuals are values or virtue ethics centred, defined as having difficulty with lying, high focus to detail (and for you, vrery much NOT the detail you want aired out in public).  

this is why many books, many blogs, many speakers are tolerated with softer suppression, but there's a core group who get whatever is manifestly a "killswitch"; they are shut the fuck up, often at extreme cost.  

and when you see what it is, it's actually a little surprising, because it's essentially the foundational building blocks of several different arguments, but these are not hard concepts per se to get to.  

it's just a particular positioning is required to see them, a particular way of looking at the world is required to translate them, and a particular type of character to persist in saying them without too much regret.

so we have our high-friction individuals, and we have them hitting on a key point.  

by design, if you always follow the algorithm for "how to deal with these 'risks'", you're going to end up with something that looks a lot like two things, which are often done simutaneously:  

- the beginning of a holocaust  

- the first purges of a rising total power (e.g. long knives) 

this is not to levy a legal argument on these points, but rather, to highlight what this resembles to the casual onlooker who has read 20th century history textbooks.  

we were told to look for warning signs.  

killing political opponents, advocacy figures of targeted communities, dissenting voices, professionals honouring ethics -- whether "all" you are doing is killing their voice, or whether they pass away through whatever means, the output is total silence.  

total silence in these personalty types, by definition, requires significant intervention, which makes this a dangerous undertaking.  

this is also a good example of how no holocaust ever starts off as a holocaust, but rather, escalates and progresses, becoming all consuming and eventually often only burning out because there are no bodies left to burn.  

if you wanted the modern day "witch hunt", this suits the genocides of a group which was defined in large part on gendered terms (women +/- queer) and on what was provided to their immediate community (healers not sanctioned by central power, inc men).  

while the pomp and ceremony, the tools and props, all formed part of the justification at the time for their executions, what was being targeted in particular once these "hunts" were in full swing was social influence which would have provided some immunity to total capture by centralised authority. be that by the king, the church, or a local or regional government.  

these events were often "kept local", and only some of the strands would end up in central government official business (usually directed more towards whose land over the sea are we going to pillage today).

due to the influence of the printing press of the persecution of individuals under the banns of "witchcraft", and the use of tropes and stereotypes of older scapegoating of marginalised communities (witches hats resembled "jew's hats", another way of badging difference, as e.g.), this puts us not in a "satanic panic" era, but something closer to that one incel who wrote the malious mallefacarum.  

as well as setting back obstetric care by hundreds of years (and thereby being responsible for thousands aof deaths of mothers and babies), gynaecology, and common herbal and medical practices in folk contexts, this was the first real "viral" classic of the printing press era.  

not unlike qanon, the witchunting brigade morphed their sales pitch for persecution of others en masse around what was preexisting, what was expolitative and useful to those funding them, and what gave a sense of emotional satisfaction (however morally wrong) to the audience of those civilians who watched as their neighbours were tried and executed.

this does mean that we may need to stretch our usual political reading.  

but don't despair.  

i've been observing something quite closely since 2020, because humans never just have "one guy" who has the golden key to solving a problem.  

we all experience similar circumstances and we bring up a whole ecosystem of knowledge and response in reaction.  

so there are quite a lot of newly published and researched books, as well as some which are a little older (10/20 year range), which address the factors around this social scare, how it happened, what could have stopped it, etc etc.  

so polsci might need to get their witches and wizards fancy dress out early and get to work.  

i would prefer NOT to go through a second european "let's burn anyone who knows how to cool a fever".

there is something about *mass death event* = *widespread paranoia* = *burn everyone who is trying to be flexible around the problem and get through this mess*  

? reflexive self-sabotage attempt to maintain power  

i might have a day off today - i've managed to convince myself that probably someone is reviewing my personal data problem and probably they might help me to not die.  

it's calming but i'm a bit delerious from what that shatterfork migrane situation has done to my sleep.
