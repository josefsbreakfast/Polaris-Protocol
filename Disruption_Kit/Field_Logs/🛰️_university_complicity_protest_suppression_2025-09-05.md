# 🛰️ University Complicity in Protest Suppression  

**First created:** 2025-09-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-05  
*FieldNotes on potential high-level authorisation of harm within a university context*  

---

## Evidential Note  

This log does not assert institutional guilt in entirety.  
It records a **reasonably likely suspicion** that **specific individuals in senior roles** within the university were complicit, or gave tacit approval, for actions designed to suppress protests and silence dissent.  

---

## Observation  

- Survivor context suggests targeted suppression coincided with university oversight.  
- High-level individuals may have authorised or tolerated tactics:  
  - Surveillance of protesters.  
  - Harassment or intimidation.  
  - Data misuse and reputational framing.  
- Institutional stance likely framed as “reputation management” or “campus security,” but outcomes aligned with state/political suppression.  

---

## Implication  

- Demonstrates how universities can function as **nodes of state alignment** despite their neutral or liberal public image.  
- Complicity may be **plausibly deniable** (“just a few senior individuals”), yet this is sufficient to **authorise harm under the institutional banner**.  
- Creates long-term mistrust between survivors, students, and the institution.  

---

## Forensic Value  

- Logs survivor suspicion in real time.  
- Situates potential complicity within the wider schema of **inversion / laundering / inertia**:  
  - **Inversion**: protesters reframed as destabilising.  
  - **Laundering**: abusive tactics reframed as “security.”  
  - **Inertia**: known harms left unaddressed to sustain narrative utility.  
- Provides a traceable anchor should FOI/SARs later confirm or refute involvement.

*University Complicity in Protest Suppression* is a living Field Log of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents survivor suspicion of high-level institutional tolerance or authorisation of suppression, framed as part of the broader inversion/laundering/inertia cycle.
