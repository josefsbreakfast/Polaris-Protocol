actually seriously.  

a lot of men, despite being... men, genuinely underestimate how fucking *easy* it is to put an idea into a man's head, have him regard it with curiosity, seriously risk assess the pros and cons, and at least get up to check if there's any and out some vaking paper on a list.  

this shit is how we all trick you into aiding and abetting the family shopping list.  

imagine what we could acheive if you didn't need to pretend to be in charge *all the goddamn time*.
