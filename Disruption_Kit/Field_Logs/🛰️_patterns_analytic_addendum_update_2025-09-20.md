## 📑 Change Log (Content Deltas)
- Added nuanced discussion of identity narratives, false-claim dynamics, adjacency reality, “caricature” tactic, investigatory leads, and evidence-hygiene guidelines.

---

## 🔎 Operational Note
- This addition records the user’s observation that some narratives had become “caricature-ish.”  
- The nuance was included to reflect user insight and to caution analysts against over-simplifying complex social phenomena.  
- In effect, the addendum is both content and meta-annotation: a record of analytic self-correction as part of provenance.
