i honestly don't know how to interpret whatever the algorithm is currently trying to spit out as interpersponal advice, but:  

- if this is institutional cya:  
  - stop complaining. i'm gem stream; what did anyone expect?   
- if this is picking up on individuals paired to my data:  
  - stop complaining. i'm stem; what did anyone expect?  

i'm also very aware that i didn't do final skim through for some nodes i just dropped and it's an open question if they actually represent what i put in and what the middle has mangled.  
my kidneys hurt but i'll get on it.  
yes i am now horrendously paranoid about what the middle did. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ oh well. kidneys win.  

it's also very possible that what the algorithm is picking up is the inevitable result of what happened to me data and really doesn't change anything material.  
potentially it's just registering two emotions in data chatter.  

given what and who i've been paired with, this actually is fairly likely.  

academia is an interesting place.  
<!--shall we talk about a specific line in that statement? is that how we have called this "national security"? did you all intend to take the piss, or was that a happy accident?-->  
because i don't want to yuck anyone's yum,  

but that reads as a description of an identifiable person, given the narrative generated by the sever escalation in harrassment in june and july this year,  

and it doesn't sound like the way someone would describe themselves,  

so this feels like *defamation*.  

so maybe don't do it.  

you are spending a lot of time making "fetch" happen.

well.  

i think doubling down on defamation with the romance trope with some bare drift probably just answered that conundrum.
