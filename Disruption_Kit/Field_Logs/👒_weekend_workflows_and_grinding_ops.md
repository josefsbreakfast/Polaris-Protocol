the last few days, since the partial sar return and corrospondant ask for duty of candour, plus the earlier request to ico after data concerns around multip high-risk data flags not accounted in initial risk management, and clear evidence of two "chloe" profiles at core institution...  

and the impersonation/grinding-of-people/depression machine is in high gear.  

it's slogging, but i guess i am used to it enough to know what it is.  

it also didn't take writing about the student encampments, the democratic element, and who ultimately benefits, very well at all.  

we shall see how things go.

less than 5 mins in, and we have our forst azure ad sign-in of the day to a university account.  

the one that "doesn't exist" half the time.  

or maybe it's the one that does exist and it's getting a haircut.  

the feeling that someone can just go in and essentially make your files look however suits them, is really "rug from under your feet" inducing.  

the "record" is what they makd it, unless someone is looking properly, and most of the onlookers can see precisely nothing.  

whoever was instrumental in planning really looked at this whole mess at some point and said, "you know what? that one can lose everything in her life, everything she's wirked so hard for. yup."  

the worst thing?  

it looks systematic.  

that is to say, practiced, as if iit's been done many times before.  

i don't want to have to pursue any of this, but i know if i don't, other people may not have what's happening to them stopped or discovered.  

it doesn't matter if it's a cluster of errors / oversights, or otherwise;  

it just needs to stop, be repaired, and be compensated for where harms are present.  

that's a pretty bottom-of-the-barrel, "the bar is in hell that's how easy it is" ask.

I had a sleep so that I could recover the lost sleep last night; my devices/wifi/5g are now absolutely convinced we are in Sheffield, and regarding the last two photos, we really don't want everyone to know that.  

Given the earlier access to azure ad own uni account? Let's think about it logically.  

Our "arms industry / surveillance capitalism" questions are these:  

What or who is based in Sheffield, who would favour access through Azure AD or Gmail over other systems, who has a collection of access routes into other applications and algorithms, who is really keen for you to not know they are based in Sheffield?  

More importantly?  

Which of the British citizens, in order for our Sheffield party and I to have met and been so intimate, are still walking around with the ability to sign off on such decisions?  

Is a very interesting sort of questions when you think about it.  

Our islands are so terribly small.  

When systems trend and favour, suppression and silence of a specific groups of people, it really does taste so little, to nudge and worsen the process.  

Tschuss.
