the last few days, since the partial sar return and corrospondant ask for duty of candour, plus the earlier request to ico after data concerns around multip high-risk data flags not accounted in initial risk management, and clear evidence of two "chloe" profiles at core institution...  

and the impersonation/grinding-of-people/depression machine is in high gear.  

it's slogging, but i guess i am used to it enough to know what it is.  

it also didn't take writing about the student encampments, the democratic element, and who ultimately benefits, very well at all.  

we shall see how things go.

less than 5 mins in, and we have our forst azure ad sign-in of the day to a university account.  

the one that "doesn't exist" half the time.  

or maybe it's the one that does exist and it's getting a haircut.  

the feeling that someone can just go in and essentially make your files look however suits them, is really "rug from under your feet" inducing.  

the "record" is what they makd it, unless someone is looking properly, and most of the onlookers can see precisely nothing.
