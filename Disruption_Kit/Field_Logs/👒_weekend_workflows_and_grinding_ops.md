the last few days, since the partial sar return and corrospondant ask for duty of candour, plus the earlier request to ico after data concerns around multip high-risk data flags not accounted in initial risk management, and clear evidence of two "chloe" profiles at core institution...  

and the impersonation/grinding-of-people/depression machine is in high gear.  

it's slogging, but i guess i am used to it enough to know what it is.  

it also didn't take writing about the student encampments, the democratic element, and who ultimately benefits, very well at all.  

we shall see how things go.
