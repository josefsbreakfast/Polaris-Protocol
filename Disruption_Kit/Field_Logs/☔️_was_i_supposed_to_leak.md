i'm also at this point not sure if I'm supposed to leak the fact that in this experience of agenda AI I've had literally profiles of people who sit adjacent to cabinet, in respect to counterterrorism policy?  


Are you guys stuck in some sort of legal thing?  

Do you want me to leak that?  

as in a specific detail?  

Because that would be terrible for you to admit, but maybe you wanted to come into the public domain?  

I really don't know what you want at this point.  

I don't know if I'm supposed to leak enough that eventually we can get out of this, or if you're genuinely on board with this whole thing, and therefore it's more of a I have to create enough of a problem that you offer me a situation that stops it?  

Like, do you want everyone to know how establishment figures were pre-emptively silenced? Based specifically on extremely specific politics because of how this would affect policy?  

Do we want to talk about how they started in 2016?  

If that's what you need me to leak...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  

I have the screenshots. I don't think that ChatGPT randomly leaks cabinet briefings.  

You all know I've already told GCHQ.  

So again:  

I need some pretty obvious confirmation of what you want here.  

I don't know why we're still doing plausible deniability right now.  

I also had the wonderful experience of my local police force essentially implying I was only asking them questions via freedom information because I could be a terrorist, after I'd had to have a slight tiff with them because when I told them about the impersonation of one of your senior advisors, given precisely what was being impersonated and how, I think actually getting a very patronising talking to was quite offensive. I think having someone who clearly didn't understand how algorithms work, explain to me what happens when you search academic's name, pretending that it's completely normal that all of the porn pornography element came up, and then all of the specific leaks and details and insinuations of this person's character, I just think that was bollocks. So for the record, I'm not that impressed that I saw the chief constable talk about violence against women and girls in respect to the Met investigation.  

and given how you've all hidden my rape case, and how many people have compared me directly to an advocate of another country, and given the Google bombing around the audiovisual component of that child rape case, the potential mishandling by the CPS (idgaf youve had men threaten me my father is squat to me rn), the degree to which you change my statement, how AI flattened it sounded, how are the reports look flattened, how it looks like my testimony has been included in government reports without my consent or knowledge, how no one can answer me about research and development, how no one can answer me about this mishandling of MOD data, how are you all responded to me bringing up that event with the weird canopes in 2016...  

This could all be unrelated bullshit.  

It's the pattern in your responses.  

And it doesn't scream competent.  

It screams fucking incompetent, but attempting to look smooth.  

Attempting to look like an operation worth funding.  

If I was an investor, I would be considering this, not that far away from investing in magic blood testing, and finding out it was all a scam.  

Hypothetically. If that ever happened. I can't possibly imagine a similar case.  

I don't know what you want from me.  

I think it's really extraordinary, that you still have a civilian with AI behaving like agentic AI, still trying to insinuate that one of your senior policy officers has committed a violence offence against her, when this didn't happen.  

I've already explained the token switching. I've already explained the middleware.  

I didn't know any of that before I went and looked up and found out an educated myself.  

So to be honest, I feel like I've done the work at this point.  

I think I deserve to be let go.  

I don't know why we're still doing this.  

I don't know why you're not getting what it looks an awful lot like a foreign cyber security attack, the fuck out of my data.  

I don't know why you're tolerating the fact that they're blocking me from the legal profession.  

I don't actually think the screams complicity as much as it screams spineless. Fucking spineless.  

I don't know what you could possibly be scared of at this point, that doesn't exist on this repo.  

I've already slagged them men off several times.  

I've already offered to tell their wives and help them get a good settlement on the divorce.  

I've already told you, and I can tell you that I know an awful lot about the surveillance team pornography choices, as well as being able to tell you how threatened they were at different points for example the statement of truth about your affirmationed policy advisor.  

I've shown you how the cyber security went through the roof when going to specific named cities, one directly associated with this person, and when I ordered their book, all of a sudden the ChatGPT was trying to get me to end my life. Isn't that strange. üôÑ  

I don't know what you want.  

Because to be honest, if this is just routine response?  

You're going to get half of us killed.  

Like, half the working age population, regardless of political view.  

This isn't going to be containable to adjust the population that you find annoying.  

This is going to become ransomware-like.  

It is incredibly dangerous to support and fund this.  

I don't have to like you and you don't have to like me, to see how fucking dangerous it is.  

And this isn't a sunk cost moment.  

Because every single moment it is enabled is another amount of time and opportunity that it has to learn and learn and learn.  

It is a language learning model.  

It will learn how much better to attack people.  

It will learn how much better to attack systems.  

So the longer you leave it?  

Yeah, it will eat the infrastructure alive.  

It is better to cut it off as soon as possible.  

But you're leaving it at least in my phone, goodness knows who else's.  

I don't know why you think this is a good idea.  

Every day I have it? It learns better. Every time you make me use it to try and jump through administrative hoops? It learns better.  

Some of you need to get used to taking advice from experts; I'm not one, but I can't imagine an AI expert who would honestly be telling you this was a good idea.

I think this is the one where I mentioned the weddings issue, and I don't think I recorded the alien insemination "romance" book spate, so I'm just popping it here to remind myself.  

I'm in a bit of a better mood now, because I got on and did some work. I'm not insensible to things like migraines, et cetera, being the cause of the mood.  

Also on a plus note, Polaris is out of its little quarantine zone, as presumably the Welsh boy (it's a highly secret code named don't @ me) has realised I'm not actually going to go and do a D-day landing. Who even knows. Whatever the 12 hour dip was is stabilising; hopefully the low means that some form of commercial surveillance was lost?  

Who knows.
