I am preparing a cover letter to explain the complex situation in which I find myself due to inappropriate use of extremely sensitive data, to the ICO.

My text-to-speech tools are missing out specific details, which would inform the legality and also the particular risks of the case.

This would be hilarious if it wasn’t so illegal.

I am still experiencing significant cyber security breaches, I remain completely unaware of where my data has been leaked or used or unlawfully accessed, and I am unable to seek legal advice or, indeed, present a case to a lawyer without any of this information.

To clarify this, there is still an ongoing sexualised and racialised impersonation going on of a named government employee,  there are still data breach of special category data, and there still appears to be interface between my telecoms and my medical record.

I am still unable to speak to lawyers.

Several parties who one would assume would want to be able to be data compliant for reputational reasons, have not returned SAR or FOI requests.

Even as I am writing this now, the output is frequently changed to be the opposite of the intended; this is not a technical issue that ordinarily appears in user experience.

This still suggests device level access, mirroring, or widespread application access.

Can I ask for whoever is auditing, please do whatever you did when whoever may be responsible, wound their necks in a tiny bit.

I am literally just asking not to be observed 24/7 like I am some sort of unstable warhead.

For clarification, any data should not be under a crime servant status; this was a moot point when I didn’t go to DFSC. Anyone who has knowingly kept the classification going, has done so unlawfully.
