# 🛰️ Interference and Throttling Context — Field Log  
**First created:** 2025-09-22 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Record of a concentrated week (2025-09-15 → 2025-09-22) of pronounced interference, connectivity outages, and the effects on capacity and workflow.*  

---

## 📅 Summary Window  
**2025-09-15 → 2025-09-22** (7 days).  
Over this seven-day window the intensity and frequency of interference noticeably escalated and has remained materially disruptive.  

---

## 🔎 Key Observations  
- Multiple points of **sexualisation** and **impersonation content** escalated through the week beginning 2025-09-15.  
- Today (2025-09-22), **throttling especially sharp**; an **ambient background drag** reduces ability to work cleanly on repo tasks.  
- **Complete loss of internet connectivity for ~6 minutes** (no web, no calls) followed by a noticeable period of **nudging** (attempts to influence or redirect activity).  
- Disruption **clustered around my activities**: windows when I work or post tend to attract concentrated throttling or manipulation.  
- Because throttling has been so disruptive I have **not yet created full repo nodes** for many throttling patterns; instead posting preliminary notes/examples on BlueSky.  
  - **To-do:** retrospectively cross-reference BlueSky posts and extract formal nodes/timestamps into the repo.

## 🧭 Clarification for Readers  
- I do **not** know why this level of monitoring and interference is occurring. Hypotheses are conjecture.  
- Many institutions/actors who might be expected to answer either refuse to confirm/deny, give strange or unhelpful replies, or do not engage.  
- When I say I am **resisting**, I mean resisting **violence** being done to me by someone/some group whose motives/identity I do not fully understand.  
- This log is not a judgement of my conduct. It records uncertainty and the absence of confirmed justification to prevent readers assuming culpability, provocation, or misconduct.

## 📝 Audit & Systemic Context (Lived Work)  
- To understand/respond I have had to **audit my life** across multiple time frames — past year and sometimes 10–20 years — searching for anything that might plausibly have raised risk factors for surveillance (intentional or accidental).  
- This has involved learning about **surveillance law in the UK**, parliamentary rulings, and institutional processes — material that is upsetting and technical.  
- During this period I have experienced **cyber security incidents** (attacks, deletions) and unusual events affecting people around me, compounding investigation and recovery.  
- Practical absurdity: received another **DWP disability evidence request** despite a tribunal within the last year — overlaps with concerns about sensitive-record security (e.g., rape records linked to Google-bombing incidents).  
- I am effectively resisting **ongoing surveillance of my body and life** while trying to outpace sensory input, environmental monitoring, and trace activity. Pauses or apparent step-backs in repo work are often the result of relentless defensive labour rather than inactivity.  

---

## 📱 Phone & Ambient Surveillance Note  
- My phone is almost never “quiet.” I cannot use it the way others do because background activity, designed/unconscious-bias content, and manipulative emotional triggers appear constantly — requiring continual source-checking and cautious use.  
- During the most intense windows this week I deliberately ran higher-risk tasks (likely to attract punitive attention). Pushing through produced useful evidence but increased fatigue.  
- As a result I have **collected clearer screenshots and logs** showing cyber monitoring/interference on my devices. Some are already posted to BlueSky.  

---

## 📂 Evidence & Legal-Prep Note  
- Screenshots, logs, and BlueSky posts strengthen a factual bundle for institutions (public and private) when requesting information about where my personal data is held or how it has been processed.  
- They will also support a future legal case — helping a lawyer build a chronology and evidentiary file.  
- **To-do:** transfer screenshots, timestamps and BlueSky URLs into the retrospective cross-reference node and tag entries with device, timestamp, and short description.  

---

## ⚠️ Impact Note  
- If I were in paid remote work — particularly as a **disabled woman working from home** — this pattern would be **severely damaging** to employment, income, safety, and wellbeing.  
- Even without paid remote work, the clustering of disruption around my activity materially degrades my capacity to sustain work and care tasks.  
- Current pragmatic strategy: **push work hard during available windows** hoping to hit moments when the system/operators are exhausted. Brief opportunities allow task completion but raise time/energy/health costs.  

---

## 🏥 Additional Physical Context  
- Experienced a **migraine earlier last week**, which forced clustering of housework and left me physically depleted.  
- Have been **largely housebound for about a year**, a circumstance that both results from and amplifies the harms documented in this repo.

*Interference and Throttling Context — Field Log* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the impacts of sustained interference and throttling — across a defined seven-day window — situating technical disruption alongside physical, tactical, and livelihood impacts.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
