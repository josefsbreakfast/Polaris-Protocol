paper notes to be transcribed; my goodness.  

---

in council house, awaiting start of council meeting of which divestment motion is #13; conflicting appointments around and may come in amd out.  

internet connection has already been difficult with no ability to access and then some access but no ability to commit for around 40 mins; are we feeling nervous?  

already nudged telecomms using another citizen (non il, non jewish, additional sp data risk present, ?more misapplied osa).  

takedowns to links this morning, interference to milk-toast organisation around democratoc comms and organising.

welcome; guess who's back. nu?

motion passed.  

for the amount of nudging if not just nyself but others, and the degree of what everyone has given and gone through to get here, i think i may now just sleep.  

i feel like the break is deserved.
