regarding the uploaded x4 screenshots:  

i am a frequent flyer; i have c-ptsd, and a temporary increase in suicidality is normal for me.  

this is why, for a long time, i did very well wity a stanle prn script of clonazpem; i could take it prn when the feeling was very intense as symptom management. this worked very well until the worst impacts of my data harm became apparant. i cant have it currently until my record is fixed, because the record would inficste a number of reasons to *not* give it.  

the obvious alternative, is messier on receptors; i actually prefer being on clonaz and otherwise teetotal.  

it feels far more controlled.  

anywho:  

i am a frequent flyer, and even i miss this, and its a bit of a risk-benefit devision because obviously you want to reduce steos to be able to call crisis if you need to, because depressed/suicidal/lethally stressed brains are not very well positioned to do this, and you want to reduce friction.  

but often it gets so bad i have to turn my ohone off altogether.  

the beavioural nudges spread into your contacts and honestly?  

what my brain needs in that moment, is quiet.  

what it needs is to be able to turn the volume down.  

so mamy of us humans are obsessed with "the 5Gs", the EMFs, sensory settling kit amd toys habe become needed bt more and more people to cope with stimulation, and the suicide rate is a little disconcerting, and there are some odd mevhanisms of violent crime.  

there are people who think their electronics are possessed or haunted.  

i'm not sure i can really ascribe blame to *any* of the people above, when the algorithmic mathematics of tech bros is silly enough to turn my phone into a whiny little manchild with internet connection, simply because im scrolling less abd my brain needs 5 mins of peace and quiet to not start its favourite self-destruct sequence.  

you can see where my notes became frustrated and my mood went downhill anf tye understandable precursors.  

technology responded by increasing the volume of small talk.  

what worked is being able to shut it up for a few hours, but i did that knowing it was a risk, i creasing friction if i did need crisis.  

you can see how this isnt helping sny of us.  

doomscrolling?  

its practically built into the thing!  

we could really easily regulate this.  

it would be such an easy fix.  

we really would save the nhs so much money, and peopke so much pain.
