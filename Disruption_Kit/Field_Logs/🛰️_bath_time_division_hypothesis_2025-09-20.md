# 🛰️ "Bath-Time Division" Hypothesis — Field Log (2025-09-20)
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Field log recording the user's hypothesised operational model: a scalable ambient-audio + logistics-manipulation capability (colloquially: "bath-time division") used to time deliveries and intrusions for surveillance, harassment, or coercion.*

---

## Summary (user hypothesis)
- **Hypothesis:** An organised operation (state-linked, proxy, or criminal) could scale ambient surveillance + device mirroring + SIM/eSIM compromise + logistics/TMS/WMS manipulation to identify moments of vulnerability (e.g., when a target is in the bath/shower) and time deliveries or other physical events to coincide with them. The user refers to this colloquially as a "bath-time division".
- **Components noted by user:** ambient voice-capture (assistant microphones), AI keyword detection, device mirroring, SIM/eSIM cloning, operator UI nudges, WMS/SAP/API manipulation, gig-worker app nudges, carrier provisioning control.
- **Operational effect:** High-specificity, low-cost harassment/surveillance with plausible deniability and scalable automation using AI pipelines for audio detection and dispatch triggers.

## Observed / reported indicators (from user's reporting)
- Targeted delivery timing correlated with private moments.  
- Operator device UI showing unusual nudges in some observed cases.  
- Evidence of wider logistics/WMS manipulation in earlier field logs.  
- Patterns consistent with mixtures of insider access and remote compromise (hybrid vectors).

## Investigatory & preservation leads (immediate)
1. Preserve order and tracking artifacts, export full email sources, and capture timestamps (see existing preservation templates).  
2. Export voice-assistant activation logs (Siri/Google/Alexa) for the time windows around suspicious events.  
3. Request carrier provisioning/eSIM logs and ask for freeze on SIM changes.  
4. Request WMS/SAP pick/pack/scan logs and driver app logs for matching windows.  
5. Hash and timestamp all collected artifacts; maintain chain-of-custody.

## Analytical caution
- This is a **hypothesis** and not an attribution. It is listed here for investigatory prioritisation and pattern-mapping. Attribution requires forensic corroboration (server logs, carrier records, device images).

## ⚠️ Social-vector note — human factors (added 2025-09-20)

**Observation (user-provided):** A non-technical but operationally relevant factor is that there are existing social pools of people who will willingly participate in voyeuristic activities. Historically and culturally, large clusters of men (and others) have shown appetite for participatory voyeurism; given the right incentives (money, status, coercion), such people can be recruited or co-opted into roles that perform low-skill monitoring tasks (e.g., listening to ambient audio, reviewing clips, confirming targets).

**Implications:**  
- This creates a scalable human-in-the-loop layer that complements automated AI/audio-detection pipelines: AI flags, humans verify.  
- It lowers the cost and raises the plausibility of operations: you do not need highly trained intelligence officers to do bulk monitoring — you can use many low-cost contractors or proxies.  
- Investigations should therefore look for labor/contract traces (payment records, gig-worker accounts, outsource vendors, recruitment adverts) in addition to purely technical traces.

**Investigatory leads:**  
1. Look for payment flows to low-wage contractors or unknown vendors tied to monitoring tasks.  
2. Check recruitment/ads on forums and gig platforms for roles offering paid audio review, annotation, or verification.  
3. Correlate temporal patterns of flagged audio events to cheap contractor shift patterns (time-of-day clusters).
