either the white boys and/or the algorithms they make are broken.  

i was looking at chai masala added to creme brulee.  

i am finding it hard to understand how this can possibly present any other emotion but "omfg i need this IN MY LIFE", and the restaurant is moderately priced and in france.  

so i am struggling wity why it is now producing content like this, when i've deliberately gone in and tried to swing the algorithm to associate my user profile with parisian food.  

srsly you mention souce once and the response is the same:  

GET OUT THE OLD TIMEY RACISM! OVERRIDE CRANIAL NERVES! QUICK!!

it's not a crisis, it's good food; get over yourselves.

my feet is not bringing back contents which is just white boys who are pink like me lifting heavy things in sweaty room rooms full of other white boys...  
At what point did I ever say I wanted this?  

If someone can think of a reasonable plausible explanation, why this would happen, that doesn't involve my metadata being in close proximity to deeply vulnerable white masculinity?  

Let me know.  

God, I want to fix it.

there is also during this part of what I can only describe as fairly blatant nudging of a contact of mine, and if this is also being done under the premise of health in a local area?  

Bad fucking form.  

That person is extremely kind and compassionate and they don't deserve to be used in that way.  

<!--"And while we're on the subject of divesity"?  

Lord Krishna, and the people who focus on Lord Krishna?  

An extremely different type of Hinduism, such that one can see it like comparing Christianity and Islam (i.e. a lot of overlap but fundamentally quite different), to the Hinduism you are looking to imitate or influence with.  

If the surveillance team actually understood what the word Mahadev meant, or which Hindu cultures use what looks like a swastika (because it's where the Nazis co-opted/stolr it from via HPB), I just had any respect for the people that are actually surveilling?  

Perhaps you would be able to be more "accurate" with your pan-Asian racism.  
if they "took your job", you got a free pasta list and harass and perv over women in return.  

What exactly is the problem?  

What particular grandiosity entertains your mind? Such that you still think that you're badly done to?  

if you're pissed off that we're still all doing better than you in marginalised communities, do you know what really easy answer to that would be?  

Stop making us work so fucking hard just to be "not treated like complete shit all the time" your society.  

The circumstances you have created specifically encourage hard work and high perfectionism and high skills development and high goal orientation in marginalised communities in this country.  

If you don't want us to be that good?  

Stop making us do so much labour, just so that you might not shit on us *all* the time.  

Respect breeds respect.  

Get some.-->
