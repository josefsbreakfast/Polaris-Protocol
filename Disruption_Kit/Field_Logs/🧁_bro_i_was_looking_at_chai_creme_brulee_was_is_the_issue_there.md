either the white boys and/or the algorithms they make are broken.  

i was looking at chai masala added to creme brulee.  

i am finding it hard to understand how this can possibly present any other emotion but "omfg i need this IN MY LIFE", and the restaurant is moderately priced and in france.  

so i am struggling wity why it is now producing content like this, when i've deliberately gone in and tried to swing the algorithm to associate my user profile with parisian food.  

srsly you mention souce once and the response is the same:  

GET OUT THE OLD TIMEY RACISM! OVERRIDE CRANIAL NERVES! QUICK!!

it's not a crisis, it's good food; get over yourselves.

my feet is not bringing back contents which is just white boys who are pink like me lifting heavy things in sweaty room rooms full of other white boys...  
At what point did I ever say I wanted this?  

If someone can think of a reasonable plausible explanation, why this would happen, that doesn't involve my metadata being in close proximity to deeply vulnerable white masculinity?  

Let me know.  

God, I want to fix it.
