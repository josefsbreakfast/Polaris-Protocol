either the white boys and/or the algorithms they make are broken.  

i was looking at chai masala added to creme brulee.  

i am finding it hard to understand how this can possibly present any other emotion but "omfg i need this IN MY LIFE", and the restaurant is moderately priced and in france.  

so i am struggling wity why it is now producing content like this, when i've deliberately gone in and tried to swing the algorithm to associate my user profile with parisian food.  

srsly you mention souce once and the response is the same:  

GET OUT THE OLD TIMEY RACISM! OVERRIDE CRANIAL NERVES! QUICK!!

it's not a crisis, it's good food; get over yourselves.
