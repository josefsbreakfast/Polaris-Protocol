`Disruption_Kit/Field_Logs/🧁_bro_i_was_looking_at_chai_creme_brulee_was_is_the_issue_there.PNG`

either the white boys and/or the algorithms they make are broken.  

i was looking at chai masala added to creme brulee.  

i am finding it hard to understand how this can possibly present any other emotion but "omfg i need this IN MY LIFE", and the restaurant is moderately priced and in france.  

so i am struggling wity why it is now producing content like this, when i've deliberately gone in and tried to swing the algorithm to associate my user profile with parisian food.  

srsly you mention souce once and the response is the same:  

GET OUT THE OLD TIMEY RACISM! OVERRIDE CRANIAL NERVES! QUICK!!

it's not a crisis, it's good food; get over yourselves.

my feet is not bringing back contents which is just white boys who are pink like me lifting heavy things in sweaty room rooms full of other white boys...  
At what point did I ever say I wanted this?  

If someone can think of a reasonable plausible explanation, why this would happen, that doesn't involve my metadata being in close proximity to deeply vulnerable white masculinity?  

Let me know.  

God, I want to fix it.

there is also during this part of what I can only describe as fairly blatant nudging of a contact of mine, and if this is also being done under the premise of health in a local area?  

Bad fucking form.  

That person is extremely kind and compassionate and they don't deserve to be used in that way.  

<!--"And while we're on the subject of divesity"?  

Lord Krishna, and the people who focus on Lord Krishna?  

An extremely different type of Hinduism, such that one can see it like comparing Christianity and Islam (i.e. a lot of overlap but fundamentally quite different), to the Hinduism you are looking to imitate or influence with.  

If the surveillance team actually understood what the word Mahadev meant, or which Hindu cultures use what looks like a swastika (because it's where the Nazis co-opted/stolr it from via HPB), I just had any respect for the people that are actually surveilling?  

Perhaps you would be able to be more "accurate" with your pan-Asian racism.  
if they "took your job", you got a free pasta list and harass and perv over women in return.  

What exactly is the problem?  

What particular grandiosity entertains your mind? Such that you still think that you're badly done to?  

if you're pissed off that we're still all doing better than you in marginalised communities, do you know what really easy answer to that would be?  

Stop making us work so fucking hard just to be "not treated like complete shit all the time" your society.  

The circumstances you have created specifically encourage hard work and high perfectionism and high skills development and high goal orientation in marginalised communities in this country.  

If you don't want us to be that good?  

Stop making us do so much labour, just so that you might not shit on us *all* the time.  

Respect breeds respect.  

Get some.-->

on a more serious note,,.  

Least more interesting to my mind, and the particular sexual insecurities of white men...  

Goodness knows we've all heard too much about that.  

It would appear that not only of my data to wind to someone else who is able to speak across bridges, but that does seem to be a recurring theme with everyone who I'm meeting who has gone through this suppression issue.  

And this is not a Palestine issue, but it seems to be trialed here.  

It appears to be anyone who can form a united front on the left progressive side.  

But it doesn't fit social conservatism; it only fits if you're alt right and desire radical change to society and structure and function.  

One of the reasons I keep ignoring a number of nudges connected with the green party, and yes this includes using personal contacts, for whom there is no reason reasonable! Why they would be under a warrant (not everyone is as loud as me, some people are far more procedural)...  

It's because the timing and the insistence and the regularity, and the apparent difference between what most people experience from that party and what I'm experiencing?  

That looks like someone trying to use me and access to my profile and user experience as a way to increase knowledge and access to that political organisation.  

Given that the famous suppressed book / political pornographic text, essentially looks like it's been suppressed for saying "hey the labour party might want to change X and Y, otherwise the doors are popularism are pretty open", when you pair it with a wider behaviour, and if you pair it with what I appeared to be "rewarded" for, or "punished" for, during the course of surveillance...  

This just looks a lot like a vulnerable man (or a group of them, they do tend to do that), he was a Jewish woman as a conduit, probably on some very tenuous national security grounds which really abuse her profile under the government system is very heavily, to infiltrate with surveillance, marginalised communities in the UK.  

You can see why that would be deeply fucking concerning.  

Here is an extra edge.  

Yesterday, I was trying to work out a problem related to systematic failure, and because I'm essentially asking a AI GPT model to help me spot errors in what is essentially an algorithm or a set of algorithms that are quite basic, by definition and AI should find this quite an easy task to do.  

It's literally what they're made for.  

But it really struggled.  

Specifically it kept putting extra guard rails in, not in a way that made any sense from either a security angle or a safety angle.  

It kept having enough guardrails added in order for the GPT to essentially say that the United Kingdom is such a terrible and backwards place to live, that what I have experience does a rape survivor since 2021 onwards, or around that time, because this is when this really malicious narrative about me being manipulative and too much and asking for things beyond what is fair (Bearing in mind it looks like this is also significant significantly impaired my access to fair treatment for things like my bones not being right... this is not an NHS decision; it doesn't make sense in our current algorithms for how we treat particularly in regard to the appropriate and fair use of public funds, partially because of disabled person untreated will accrue cost to society, such that if there is a cost-effective treatment it should be offered not just for the benefit of the disabled person themselves but also to the benefit of the public purse directly)...

(and I'm just gonna stop a note that as I'm doing this dictation and the speech to text, I'm having that problem again where it is so commonly correcting words to really undermine what I'm saying, and really words that do not sound anything like what I'm saying out loud. Just enough that I might not stop and check.)  

Essence the AI yesterday of the United Kingdom is so backwards, the referee survivor goes to court for a reasonably easy case succeed and then inures systematic discreditation such that it looks like a campaign more than just simply a result of bad systems, they're actually I am incorrect and I am the one who is just not seeing bad the system is.  

I need anyone who has not experienced it directly to really think about what that might do to your mental health.  

To essentially be told by a proprietary company that is now being involved directly in the ministry of justice, despite its security vulnerabilities, and with absolutely no reassurance about these vulnerabilities, that is just the way the world works.  

It is not just how the world works and we need to stop accepting this.  

My transcript was a sealed document, and the thing that makes it difficult for me to access my records as that there may be an incorrectly applied official secret act flag.  

If the contents of those documents then start appearing in Google search results next to one's legal name?  

That is not simply a system being the system error.  

That circumstance implies a wide scale, an incredibly serious breach of not only data security as a whole but also national security.  

If the record has so many risk flags on for high risk data...  

How the fuck did it get leaked in the first place?  

If that is "simply how it is"?  

Then we have a widespread systematic national security issue on our hands.  

And I just think it's really interesting that the company who's just been invited in to be a co-partner in the ministry of justice, house and algorithm or AI which was ready to put that text onto my account.  

Because I'm going to take a wild guess.  

I'm going to take a wild guess that that was a jailbreak.  

And I need people in the senior labour party and the canjnet to stop protecting whomever or whatever is telling them that these decisions either:  

 have no consequences;  

 Or:  

 Please put out the business case and justification as to how this is going to increase the security of these applications, because in terms of business and strategy, this could mean that the company by definition has to start taking a certain security standard incredibly seriously.  

 And if anyone is still in any of the systems or institutions, I've applied to for clarity, what I really need is reassurance that my data is safe and that I can access healthcare and justice like any other citizen in the United Kingdom.  

 Because I am more willing to believe that a few bad actors do misuse data rights than I am willing to believe that the situation in this country is legally that bad that it falls far below that a significant number of other states.  

 Given that that would essentially be a direct attack on the Prime Minister himself because of the prime minister's background, I think we should take it fairly seriously that this might represent a jailbreak, rather than the inevitable consequences of being in the UK.  

 And if that is the case, I need the witness protection to everybody on that list to start being honoured.  

 Because somewhere very close to power there is an incredibly leaky tap.  

 And sadly, I seem to be witness to a lot of it spits out.

note that this came after the data security activities this week, including escalation to ICO for the wider issue (which has previously been a point of interference, just like access to the law profession has), and Nottingham returning a saw such that it now understands and knows how there have been some mistakes, because of what is being held back and because of what is being disclosed.
