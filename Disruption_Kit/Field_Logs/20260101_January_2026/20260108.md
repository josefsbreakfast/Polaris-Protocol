<!--i dont even know how to explain what just preceeded the connection of my headphones to the location service, after several weeks of being dropped and unable to re-register for absolutely no reason; best explaoned by "i get lots of ads for privacy screens for electronics". ffs. (YOU ALL HAVE GROK NOW; WHY ARE WE EVEN HERE 🤣🤣🤣 the control fantasy is out of this world, fr.)-->
