starting the year off with a systems error routing several parcels across the city.  

it's going to be a winner.

(it's very normal for all errors to believibly be glitches. they're just not really one-offs when it's something new every time you safety net for it, and glitches don't resolve by emailing your mp, or get worse when you try to buy a book. that's what makes it more pattern-shaped. this is becoming more of a trend with anyone whistleblower-adjacent. even just, "used to be proactive and get things done", appears to be systems-leaky enough to look like friction and "get smoothed out".)
