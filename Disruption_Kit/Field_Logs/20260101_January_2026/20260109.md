Currently getting battered back at policy level for most recent "errors"/"delations"/"reroutes" of physical goods; difficult past passing is to persist until escalated to next level (many years of practice).  
Regarding prior command failures and command overrides on iOS, checked again for clear malware evidence at non-lab level; no evidence accessibility shortcut [additional errors occurring during writing], no VPN add on, no device add on, no Bluetooth add on, devices had reset since cooccurance of strange behaviour within close router range.  
Known risk factors for unauth access; awaiting review.
