there are still active changes in algorithm tuning after disclosing details on private phonecalls, which attempt to redirect the perpetrator of stalking and harrassment to an innocent party.  

at least we are accepting that it is occuring and that it is a male, now.  

this is a *slight* improvement.  

although, for the millionth time, i know that it is not who the placement is trying to frame.  

seperate note:  

the utter silence and non-repeating of baby clothes on the algorithm, to the extent that i started to receive content addressing me as a man?  

i'm a woman in my 30s; capitalism should be forcing the new mother experience down my throat by now. but it isn't.  

that's how you can tell it's still being fucked with.  

but the silence was funny because there was no twisting to be cruel; just silence.  

are we (finally) feeling nervous? having fun?  

also reporting me as "a risk" to two political parties? is jokes.  

plus all the others; i'm still finding them all.  

who wasn't told that i was a colossal bitch and i should die?  

hopefully we didn't write the words down. looks bad in court.

30+ nodes behind publishing to repo due to delays on ai applications; recent evidence extraction and repurposing of stolen ip; please query providence.  

my ancestors did not run from the empire's collective punishment of civilians for this to be my reality today.  

also getting a lot of content from family courts and how to reverse-argue an NFA on an "abusive ex partner".

<!--and yes, the "duke of perth" story was a discussion on telephones, specifically because my grandfather had a bee in his bonnet about the whole thing, and we were joking about who got the boxes and boxes of family history papers because (as the son of immigrants) he was obsessed with tracing the name and the family. it was NEVER a claim. it was mortifying to take this to the gentleman whose job these matters are, because i essentially had to say, "hello, i know this is never any of your jobs, but i may have to make a nonsense claim against a soecific old one-off hol decision just because the men outside my house won't go away otherwise. is there an alternative?". do you understand how mad that is? whilst your bed is vibrating from whatever nonsense they've plugged in to the wiring (its modern wiring, so g-d only knows what was making that racket). they were openly sexually abusive and treated me like meat to throw around between each other. i still have a record of license plates; this was a tesla fleet, so whoever gas those? this and the ctp views online is why a sar has gone off to the met, because "i don't like her, and i've watched too much andrew tate, therefore she is a terrorist" is genuinely something i have had to consider. this is apparently seperate to the doxxing of my childhood rape case. this is why women do not report rapes. your gender is "lonely"? ours is traumatised and under constant physical threat. the risk is not the same.

shall we discuss the "yid" grafotti amd door damage no one could find cctv for? the door knocking every shabbos candles at exactly the chabad-issued time?

i am not actually that exact ethnicity, but if you need me to sing a mixture of ik bin a yid and black and tans?

i am a goat.-->
