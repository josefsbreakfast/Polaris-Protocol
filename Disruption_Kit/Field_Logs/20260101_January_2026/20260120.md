the nudges via telecoms are not helping; please stop.

significant device level stoppages.  

i know why it is.  

tldr he's still pretending he's a brown man lovebombing me because he seems to think i don't like white men.  
<!--
my line is literally, "is this person a complete and utter cunt, yes or no?"  
funny how that works to screen out so many entitled males who happen to be white.

my electronic situation has been bad for a week, horrific since the last round of sars/fois, *especially* since i covered my phone's camera.  

electonic nudges and received telecoms across emails and messages are almost exclusively temporally correlated to assumed legal stressors. receiving email whoch may require escalation will be followed by nudges, often some form of telephone call.   

no hidden apps, no devices attached, no connections, no mirrors i can see...  

whoever this is is a darkweb-makes-me-edgy idiot.  

it's nothing oversight because it isn't procedural; this is "losing control" behaviour.  

and really dislike frankness to law enforcement, and everyone else's security, apparantly.  

revealed by own processes and omissions.  

well done.  

oh.  

and it's been increase in veiled death threats for two days.  

and procedure means the period of conduct may very well be the full 10 years, may have included coercion to move, and judging from the metadata and proxy placement...  

yup. now i know.

<!--you need to see my music and reading choices this week as, "appropriate emotional expression following widespread institutional betrayal, because you trusted a bloke over the subject". thanks. let me listen to "chop dicks", which is about how we are all taught as soon as we have school uniforms how to do basic self defence by our nanas, and take slightly less offence than whoever i an digitally welded to against my will, kindly. if men didn't rape, and didn't cover for each other raping, maybe i would be more pleasent to stalk.-->
