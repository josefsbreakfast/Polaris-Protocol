unusually pervasive ui issues when compiling `🫀_a_question_of_questions.md`; multiple generations and commits required across differently-owned software; ? rulesets overidden at middleware level.  

note all cppgc references of any substance appear to be deindexed at web search level.  

this is all unhelpful for uk compliance.
