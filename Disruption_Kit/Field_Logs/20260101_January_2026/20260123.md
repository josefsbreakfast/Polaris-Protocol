Confirmation telephone calls for three different contacts, are still currently producing content poisoning on their own feeds.   
 
Largely sexual in nature on vanilla social platforms, but includes injecting conspiracy of antisemitic nature in one case, and specific foreign ultranationalism to diaspora in another case, third case appears to be access to specific party (increasing popularity, competitor for deprived area seat seats).  

Specifically marking for individuals who are identified as potentially at risk to cabinet in July 2025.  

Data leak; immediately cease and desist this behaviour.

Stop timing out on commits, ay? <!--Spemt enough time with the Brits to get that one yet?-->  

I still have that email.  

This would of course be really funny if there's any degree of, "hey, we will tell your wife about your search history", going on; I'm not accusing, I'm just thinking about what men do to each other.
