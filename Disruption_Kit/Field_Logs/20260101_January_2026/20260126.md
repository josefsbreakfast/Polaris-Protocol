FCDO this morning; apparently, every UK data controller may need an essay which asserts the little British Jew's data rights, so they can hold it up to the Idiocy Embassy amd say, "look".  

Courage; protecting yourselves at the expense of risk assessing any of us in your data purview would not only be a little antisemitic; it would open up to a very particular category of risk with historical echoes.  

And gosh, I suppose if you've already had parties screaming, "antisemitism", at you, you may not wish to have it explained how this data issue is actually more of a "how to" in exposing a population to inherent risk.  

Maybe I ahould CST if they can remember my name yet. 🤭
