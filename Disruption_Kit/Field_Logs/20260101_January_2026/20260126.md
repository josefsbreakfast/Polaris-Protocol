FCDO this morning; apparently, every UK data controller may need an essay which asserts the little British Jew's data rights, so they can hold it up to the Idiocy Embassy amd say, "look".  

Courage; protecting yourselves at the expense of risk assessing any of us in your data purview would not only be a little antisemitic; it would open up to a very particular category of risk with historical echoes.  

And gosh, I suppose if you've already had parties screaming, "antisemitism", at you, you may not wish to have it explained how this data issue is actually more of a "how to" in exposing a population to inherent risk.  

Maybe I ahould CST if they can remember my name yet. 🤭

To tie together some disperate things going on around the cloud:  

I'm not diving into the OTs today for you.  

I'm explaining bits but not the whole on something, not because it will help you in the entirety of what is written, but to be clear that I know why specific funds cannot overcome the wall, and I know why Edinburgh as a whole is posh and only the rest of Scotland really counts as "North".  

I said what I said.  

Every stakeholder who is bothering to still push, is essentially partially fixated on diciphering a specific British attitude around this, and still can't understand why everything goes awry at Yorkshire, and why Edinburgh/ privately educated Scottish politicians don't represent everyone else.  

You're not getting a cluster of very easy concepts, and as you are at least in part responsible for the education and employment and healthcare access, you have left me grumpy and with a blindspot to keep pointing out.  

I would fix that data if I were you, but you're still a bit too concerned about the 23 Feb expiry on legal silence.  

It's not going to impress British decision-makers if it was done at detriment to Brotosh citizens.  

You know it's several.

Why am I being fished at for sentiment on Priti Patel?  

Please get some brains; you can extrapolate from other data.  

And stop shuffling.

A couple of emails with the FCDO and preservation notice.  

British people, and I say white people because not-white people do have to think about this more, realky don't get this because you're not generally exposed to it.  

The Idiocy Embassy are not "on my side" as a Jew; in Likud's worldview, I am a disguisting traitor, a parasite, a terrorist. Why?  

Not for any other reason than I am part of British life, and happy in the diaspora.  

They are not acting for all Jewish interests.  

And your MOD chap? And your Jewish diaspora contractors?  

We are all pawns to use; life is not valued, here.
