FCDO this morning; apparently, every UK data controller may need an essay which asserts the little British Jew's data rights, so they can hold it up to the Idiocy Embassy amd say, "look".  

Courage; protecting yourselves at the expense of risk assessing any of us in your data purview would not only be a little antisemitic; it would open up to a very particular category of risk with historical echoes.  

And gosh, I suppose if you've already had parties screaming, "antisemitism", at you, you may not wish to have it explained how this data issue is actually more of a "how to" in exposing a population to inherent risk.  

Maybe I ahould CST if they can remember my name yet. 🤭

To tie together some disperate things going on around the cloud:  

I'm not diving into the OTs today for you.  

I'm explaining bits but not the whole on something, not because it will help you in the entirety of what is written, but to be clear that I know why specific funds cannot overcome the wall, and I know why Edinburgh as a whole is posh and only the rest of Scotland really counts as "North".  

I said what I said.
