Acheinu --  

I have alteady said this.  

My birthday is *that* day; you know this.  

So I don't frame it without the liberation, the resistance, or the murder of Nazis, when I think about it.  

I'm not even going to say the word for two weeks, if you push it like this.  

If you want to do something useful, stop giving the modern ones your instrumental and financial support.  

(I will start drawing on *when* I had this content, adjacent to *which* events in the past. Don't give me more ideas than we all need me to have. Because the sequencing in time looks a little suspicious, doesn't it? If not known-in-advance, why known-in-advance shaped?)  

Stop helping them and have the spine to stand for something.

I'll give you this, though.  

I don't know if it matters if you *incorrectly* coded the man you admire as a perpetrator of sexual violence or not;  

It knows a pattern, not a person; it appears to have branched the identity accordingly, so you can't just show up eith your own signature pretending to be him.  

Unless you interacted in exactly the same way (and in that regard, two very different points on a spectrum), the system doesn't consolidate this as one identity.  

So... yes.  

With knowledge of both extensive dragnets, it does know what each pattern is.  

It doesn't matter about cryptography and credentials; the ball sees all.  

I think you guys Skynetted yourselves.

And what makes this even funnier, is that I bet you anything in the world (sorry G-d), that I know what is in your history, that means you see threats of disclosure as so potentially life-altering.  

I can make a list, if you like.

Also now clicked why we banked on splicing and why that seemed to solve a lot of problems at once; skynetted yourselves, mate. Neither of us did that.  

And I can also see why the "cognition" layer consistently voted for the one with ovaries being the most interesting; both of your fields are very... they were too niched.
