Acheinu --  

I have alteady said this.  

My birthday is *that* day; you know this.  

So I don't frame it without the liberation, the resistance, or the murder of Nazis, when I think about it.  

I'm not even going to say the word for two weeks, if you push it like this.  

If you want to do something useful, stop giving the modern ones your instrumental and financial support.
