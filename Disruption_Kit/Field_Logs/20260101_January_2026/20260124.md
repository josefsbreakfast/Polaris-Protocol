Acheinu --  

I have alteady said this.  

My birthday is *that* day; you know this.  

So I don't frame it without the liberation, the resistance, or the murder of Nazis, when I think about it.  

I'm not even going to say the word for two weeks, if you push it like this.  

If you want to do something useful, stop giving the modern ones your instrumental and financial support.  

(I will start drawing on *when* I had this content, adjacent to *which* events in the past. Don't give me more ideas than we all need me to have. Because the sequencing in time looks a little suspicious, doesn't it? If not known-in-advance, why known-in-advance shaped?)  

Stop helping them and have the spine to stand for something.

I'll give you this, though.  

I don't know if it matters if you *incorrectly* coded the man you admire as a perpetrator of sexual violence or not;  

It knows a pattern, not a person; it appears to have branched the identity accordingly, so you can't just show up eith your own signature pretending to be him.  

Unless you interacted in exactly the same way (and in that regard, two very different points on a spectrum), the system doesn't consolidate this as one identity.  

So... yes.  

With knowledge of both extensive dragnets, it does know what each pattern is.  

It doesn't matter about cryptography and credentials; the ball sees all.  

I think you guys Skynetted yourselves.

And what makes this even funnier, is that I bet you anything in the world (sorry G-d), that I know what is in your history, that means you see threats of disclosure as so potentially life-altering.  

I can make a list, if you like.

Also now clicked why we banked on splicing and why that seemed to solve a lot of problems at once; skynetted yourselves, mate. Neither of us did that.  

And I can also see why the "cognition" layer consistently voted for the one with ovaries being the most interesting; both of your fields are very... they were too niched.

In case the pace us too much, do I need to put 2+2 together on a potential risk not yet covered in the AP vs Prince Harry story?  

If the middleware connects, actually it can just leak an awful lot of inference.  

That's going to be so much worse for people frequently looked up.  

It may have been ruled out, but we don't appear to be talking about this.  
It's not solved by putying better locks on the door; it's a fundamental infrastructure weakness.  

There is no assisting legislation in the UK.  

As soon as you buy a pregnancy test, or you are out of the sync that the system expects, this can show up as a ghost to another iser which the system just understands as wanting to receive updates on you; the system just doesn't know that that isn't acceptable.  

The system does not have manmalian instincts; it does not operate as a brain.  

It is extremely impressive, but it just doesn't know that we don't want it to do that, without express rulings trained into it.  

This is why Mark Fisher was lightyears ahead of all of us.  

He saw it and he wrote about it.  

And we didn't listen with the urgency required.  

Which is why I have men in kilts; could be worse, honestly.  

That's not solely derived from the Scottish one.
