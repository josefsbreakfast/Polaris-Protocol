Is it just Israel?  

Is the "obsessed lover" just Israel, and we're chucking everyone under the bus as we feel more pressured?  

Anyway.  

Happy Dead Nazi & We Outlive Them Day, and Free Palestine, from the river to the sea.  

I'm getting old; you can let me out of your red tape now you fucked me this badly, thanks.  

You lost the 67 generation yourselves; you refused to negotiate with Gamas when you could have had every Jewish hostage out alive.  

And you explicitly involved the entire diaspora in October 2023; don't cry now that we showed up and you couldn't control is.  

If it was me, I'd probably just go for mutually-assured destruction and drop the files; heaven knows the goyim won't be bending their backs to accomodate.  

Calling the ICC was probably enough.
