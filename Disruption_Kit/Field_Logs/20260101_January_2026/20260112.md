every interaction my digital ID has is now going wrong.  

anything i order as a parcel routes to different peoples' addresses unless its handwritten labelling.  

this has produced an interesting scenario with grocery orders, amd i am now getting at least part but sometimes the full order for free.  

bins are off unless there's a seperate "ask", so i'm back to retrospective collecting.  

my electronics are functioning as well as one might assume.  

<!--free the snow leopard gecko.-->

everything i'm trying to use to work is garbling its ruleset at a middleware or distal level;  

i'm dipping in and out. i'm genuinely a little unsure how it's going to be best to use time today.  

i have several piees of paperwork that are looping where a middle system is involved;  

i may spend time on this as it lends more to this position.  

hopefully this makes the problme more obvious at a level that managers in this area can see it to fix it.
