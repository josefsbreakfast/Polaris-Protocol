every interaction my digital ID has is now going wrong.  

anything i order as a parcel routes to different peoples' addresses unless its handwritten labelling.  

this has produced an interesting scenario with grocery orders, amd i am now getting at least part but sometimes the full order for free.  

bins are off unless there's a seperate "ask", so i'm back to retrospective collecting.  

my electronics are functioning as well as one might assume.
