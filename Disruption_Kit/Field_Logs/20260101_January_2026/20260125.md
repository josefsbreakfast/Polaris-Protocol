I'm not "anti-war", so much as ["anti-letting-our-sons-and-daughters-die-for-oil-deals"](https://youtu.be/sQMYOXegdck?si=dMlGFia22zcYwme5).  

Clearly none of you really understand why the public response was and is what it was to Iraq and Afghanistan and Guantanimo Bay.  

"Clever men"; self-appointed adjectives, clearly.  

(I'll let everyone guess how easy this was to commit.)  

If you wamt to lead us into war, I want to see you up front and under fire.

Plans for today's algorithm are in [this general direction](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1anDKDpHWC7tbnubBjLpgM?si=6SV9W9iiTnigEQ84d-gnww&pt=0e4c16db1dea44b1e6b2c5e59902e99d&pi=CfPvZYwOQfu9x).  

Clearly your temperature control is utter horseshit code, being the hapless males you are, so I'm doing 60s soft rock.  

And I'm not researching the thing that coincides with my birthday, unless it's the time Polish Resistance and Ghetto fighters trawled sewers and murdered Nazis, because armed resistance is an internationally agreed upon right when one is under illegitamate occupation by a military power.  

I might do "Gentleman" next; I like the dance.  

(I mean, I'm being nice by assuming incompetence; the other option is deliberate algorithmic shock doctrine. Anything to avoid releasing all tranches of the Epstein files, no?)

So why did we pick this Muslim and this Jew?  

Because clearly on personality amd data history, that was a terrible idea.  

So let's have a think about who could possibly benefot, and what pre-existing data twinning we may have wished to complicate.  

Because you chose two "fuck you I'm British, but also fuck breaking international law" data subjects.  

Which was dumb.  

So what were we trying to smooth over?  
I'm going to start by looking at Derbyshire, because that entire county appears very possessive over any data I have in that region.
