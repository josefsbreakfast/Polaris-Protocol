I'm not "anti-war", so much as ["anti-letting-our-sons-and-daughters-die-for-oil-deals"](https://youtu.be/sQMYOXegdck?si=dMlGFia22zcYwme5).  

Clearly none of you really understand why the public response was and is what it was to Iraq and Afghanistan and Guantanimo Bay.  

"Clever men"; self-appointed adjectives, clearly.  

(I'll let everyone guess how easy this was to commit.)  

If you wamt to lead us into war, I want to see you up front and under fire.
