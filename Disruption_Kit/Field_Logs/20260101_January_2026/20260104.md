sent a sar to fcdo because apparantly that's the british process to tell a uk-based embassy to wind their necks in on your data.  

re-nudged on bin collectiom; need to drag through a phone call on monday. it's amazing the degree of damage someone who understands uk frankenstack failure better than individual silos of uk government can do, hey?  

i've already said many times that this is no more personal than it is to everyone else who experoences it, and it's done in a systematic manner.  

uk is under the impression it can't fix it itself; this is nonsense.
