sent a sar to fcdo because apparantly that's the british process to tell a uk-based embassy to wind their necks in on your data.  

re-nudged on bin collectiom; need to drag through a phone call on monday. it's amazing the degree of damage someone who understands uk frankenstack failure better than individual silos of uk government can do, hey?  

i've already said many times that this is no more personal than it is to everyone else who experoences it, and it's done in a systematic manner.  

uk is under the impression it can't fix it itself; this is nonsense.

obviously, the social media feed is ** highly interesting** after all that so I just want to be clear that if you think this is his tin hat as I can go on this, you haven't heard my rationale for why or how the degree of suppression is happening in the protests outside of prisons.  

Given what a lot of us have gone through, I think it would be completely possible that the objective would be to make them think that no one cared about them.  

Increasing the spectacle for the prisoners inside is only going to make it extremely clear that that isn't the case, and that it hasn't been the case since they were arrested.  

I have a feeling there's a reason no one wants to admit how big the bags are.
