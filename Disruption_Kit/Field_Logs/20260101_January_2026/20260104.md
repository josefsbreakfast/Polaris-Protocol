sent a sar to fcdo because apparantly that's the british process to tell a uk-based embassy to wind their necks in on your data.  

re-nudged on bin collectiom; need to drag through a phone call on monday. it's amazing the degree of damage someone who understands uk frankenstack failure better than individual silos of uk government can do, hey?  

i've already said many times that this is no more personal than it is to everyone else who experoences it, and it's done in a systematic manner.  

uk is under the impression it can't fix it itself; this is nonsense.

obviously, the social media feed is ** highly interesting** after all that so I just want to be clear that if you think this is his tin hat as I can go on this, you haven't heard my rationale for why or how the degree of suppression is happening in the protests outside of prisons.  

Given what a lot of us have gone through, I think it would be completely possible that the objective would be to make them think that no one cared about them.  

Increasing the spectacle for the prisoners inside is only going to make it extremely clear that that isn't the case, and that it hasn't been the case since they were arrested.  

I have a feeling there's a reason no one wants to admit how big the bags are.  

strong people who feel the love and support of their community take a strong stand speaking for humanity at trial, regardless of if they are entirely admitting guilt under UK law.  
Arguing that allowing them to have access to that would be prejudicing. The legal outcome can easily be flipped to say that with holding it would be prejudicing the legal outcome.  

Obviously, this is all just a thought experiment.  

Satire.  

Discussion.

incidentally, and I'm sure in a completely unrelated manner whoever I am data twins with from a centroid or environment management / wrapper point of view, is incredibly concerned about Mamdani, his first actions, the response of New Yorkers, and in particular the response of the Jewish diaspora in New York who are pro-Mamdani.  

There is particular emphasis on the exact rationale for why they would find his actions to be so beneficial.  

At the same time, the algorithmic placement which relies on behavioural proxies, is interpreting the shares of this data atmosphere to be obsessive, avoidant, and desperate to talk to me but not able to.  

Sometimes it even flips into discussing this as actual family being obsessed and not talking, but that usually ends up with some sort of discussion of cult-like behaviour.  

The complete mystery of how I could possibly be attached to data proxies which are being interpreted this way, is obviously still completely unsolvable.  

Please send the M16 song knockoffs back. I liked those.
