Yet another day of bad-Jew-data-box.  

I would prefer we had bo subsumed me into some neo-communist-inspired dataset of hell; for a bunch of people against sharing resources as a group, you seem to be very into taling mine and sticking your name on them.  

In fact, if we could just all stop being Putin's bitches in the West, I's greatly prefer that; life is boring when your leadership cannot tolerate criticism and wants you to die in wars to make them feel big.  

I am aware my work output is rather light; I'm really quite grumpy this week, and in my defence I am in rather a lot of pain, and rather a lit of people have not only been unable to assist with queries, there is both a number of rather rude replies, and a lot of non-understanding of the distress caused.  

The finer outline of the elephant is largely visible, and the lines are sharper; a lot of British people never sought clarification from a data subject when they were advised on nationality and acted against security, racialising and discrediting on the basis of Jewish identity.  

It's either that, or a cybersecurity issue; pick.
