Yet another day of bad-Jew-data-box.  

I would prefer we had bo subsumed me into some neo-communist-inspired dataset of hell; for a bunch of people against sharing resources as a group, you seem to be very into taling mine and sticking your name on them.  

In fact, if we could just all stop being Putin's bitches in the West, I's greatly prefer that; life is boring when your leadership cannot tolerate criticism and wants you to die in wars to make them feel big.  

I am aware my work output is rather light; I'm really quite grumpy this week, and in my defence I am in rather a lot of pain, and rather a lit of people have not only been unable to assist with queries, there is both a number of rather rude replies, and a lot of non-understanding of the distress caused.  

The finer outline of the elephant is largely visible, and the lines are sharper; a lot of British people never sought clarification from a data subject when they were advised on nationality and acted against security, racialising and discrediting on the basis of Jewish identity.  

It's either that, or a cybersecurity issue; pick.  

Stakeholder map will be drafted at some point. Some of the MoUs/contracts could be 1 or 2 different ways, but it's almost complete.  

None of this is personal to my character; all of it dehumanises to a resource to be raped and exploited for nationalist benefit.  

Maybe I should have just been chucked over the wall at Hamas, after the collective fantasy of so many white and Jewish men claimed; perhaps their violence may have been shorter, less violent, less blasphemous, less of a desecration.  

(Hamas behind the illegal wall, like: "Bro, this is not what we asked for; we're throwing her back".)

I don't care if its the monstera boys or the Tel Aviv branch of idiocy; you just took the lesbians away for me. Wtf was that for?? Dip me in honey and send me the fuck back, you cowards.

Incidentally, on the subject of natural select selection:  

If it was really about natural selection, you would understand that women have likely become far more aesthetically valuable and pretty over the course of evolution, and you wouldn't bitch and whine, furthermore, the men who are actually show intraspecies selection behaviours are exactly the same men who kill the other man who commit femicide, and who are sexually violent.  

If you really want to make this about your misunderstanding of Darwin and any derivative science (the actual science, not the shit you made up in the club because you only benefitted from artificial forces upon mate selection), you would need to similarly execute paedophiles; this is clearly a net negative for the species, and it is not uncommon in the Animal Kingdom for it to attract that type of reaction.  

All I'm asking for the men to do, is that you actually follow your arguments to their conclusions, instead of doing the epstemic equivalent of trumpeting the alphabet with your arse.  

Mind.  

That would require actually being tye half of the species capable of advanced thought; little tangerines bouncing around a bowl of testosterone, is what white supremacy and capitalism has rendered "competative" in the pale ones.  

G-d help us.

And regarding the impersonations:  

I am only glad that at least one man in the world has enough common sense, to look at what I wrote publicly, look at what was received "privately", and make the bold step of putting two and two together.  

I don't think I need to know how many of the rest of you were such utter idiots, that my apparent throwing myself at you was either undetected, or you lacked the courage to give me any indication to my face.  

Before the boys in Tel Aviv start whining again, or the ones in Liverpool, all the ones in Sheffield, etc etc:  

My sexuality is not yours; this is why you in impersonated it so badly.  

You don't have to admit that it's an art you're incapable of, as clearly enough men have seen the evidence.  

(Incidentally: this is also why women generally don't want to fuck you out of choice. Uncompetative. There are literally lesbians in the world; why would they choose your lack of game?)

They've been putting very large women in my feed for about 48 hours; their pettiness is hilarious, given that tanner stages 2-3 dominantatee my feed for so long; attraction to peri-puberty is not normal, lads. It's species-sabotaging hyperobsession with doninance; it strongly suggests a lack of doscipline which would be killed off in the wild. You'd try to take on five tigers, and then we'd be rid of you.  

It also suggests a pathological semse of competition with men you know would outcompete for mates. You are not helping yourselves by showing it so clearly to the rest of us. It's an outward indicator of what I believe you all refer to as "beta" behaviour; if this worldview, it simply is not our fault as females, if our brains are weird by thousands of years of genetic competition, to devalue individuals who display that behaviour.  

It's just nature, dear.  

Apparantly, ssome of your forefathers did choose better, otherwise none of would be here. That is your true devolution of the species, as you call it.  

You think a good hunter would be whining about women's bathrooms all day? Please.  

Go out and make dinner happen, or build a shed. Stop all whatever this nonsense is and be useful.  

(Why do you think so many married men do DIY most weekends? We can't help it if our silly girl gametes look at men constructing things and decorating shelters and think, "Ah. Yes. I want that one to make more minions with". Like you are so keen on reminding us: it's "just" biology. Yes?)
