We are at August 2025 levels of “bad”, just without the prompt injection LLM catfishing/impersonation, but still with pornographic content on social feeds which lends itself to the impersonation of multiple recognisable personnel and still with risk associated.  

I think anyone in the British space needs to be aware that this is now so leaky, in terms of things that I'm not stating out right but are heavily implied, at the Ultimate source for this is highly unlikely to be UK-led.  

If we have "coordinated", and if we have "had a favour", can we please stop doing the favours to me? Thx.  

I appreciate after two years of pretty significant increase in depression, and all of the things that functionally follow, I am obviously at the peak of my attractiveness, and so who could possibly resist 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄  

this is relevant, however, to something upcoming in the next few days, so I would've really rather be able to get through and work.

NB because in Aug my work often just got straight up erased from other places:  

Ancedotal and needs investigation, but pattern with antizionist Jewish dissent in UK appears to keep arrests of women minimal (either public order, or alternative measures, or alt containment); suggests awareness and priority of optics.  

(We cannot easily be "The State's Jewess" as in Project Esther, whilst also being subject to stare violence. So the violence may be displaced on people she cares about, her support network, or through administration.)  

I suspect Jewish men are existing in this strange diasporic state that they routinely sit in, where essentially there is a decision around a "do we feminise or masculinise him?" fork. This has no relevence to social presentation of sexual identity, but rather, if the optics of arrest would be poor, the style of feminine suppression by administrative hell applies.  

The algorithm is habing a strongly moralising Christian fundie moment, btw. whole rants on covering myself up with baggy clothes, like men having etes isn't a problem there is an easier solution for.  

(Literally all I do is wear XXL shorts these days; they need to take one for the team with the eyes.)
