 I look at anything which can be generated from algorithmic placement, I am receiving a bizarre mix of essentially death threats, but then laced with this narrative of police in action due to personal distaste; the overall impact of the narrative entire, would give the impression to a user looking at this at face value, that essentially anything that is supposed to be a civil protection in this country is not going to materialise, and therefore induce his hopelessness.  
 I have a hemi-migraine, and I've had enough of it, so I'm going to force user-led content choice by listening to rain and weird ghost stories.  
 It's like living with the worst of your own personal depression self talk, on a 24/7 loop.
