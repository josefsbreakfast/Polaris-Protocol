Dammit.  
Now I've been ran through it and I'm out the other end, this is very reminicsent of the last impersonation run in the summer.  
Fucking dammit.  

Bargain Bin Mossad doesn't take days off, the motherfuckers.  

(This is why I was deliberately clear, that all we need is someone who could backend, and all that it would take, is some misattribution. This is very alike to the weird Mancs trip I had to see a doctor not get struck off (that time), essentially for being Palestinian and expressing anger at a genocide.)  

Which, if the case, means I have more people to apologise to; boy, how I love this process.  

(You can tell me I shouldn't apolofise to anyone with any complicity, but I too once believed some really dumb shit about Israel. And I am British. It's like a reflex we're born with.)
