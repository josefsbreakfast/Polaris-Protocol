ive just been looking for some cross-check evidence and i think it is safe to say...  

that while being impersonated to me is helpful in that i will call out the bluff,  

you will also have to read your name in referemce to my leaning in to the act to get the leak to show its full providence.  

so, ***** "****** *****" *******?  

i am so sorry that you appear to have been the talk of the seder this year.  

clearly the wine is liturgically necessary; at least it shits one up properly, no?  

and i don't know who invited all the list little christian boys,  

but can we perhaps dreradicalise them a little around the knights templar?  

although finding out some of those grown men are literally larping but with white table props was deeply funny to me.  

a lot of the masons i know are very sweet people; im not sure this additional copycat thing was really on the money.  

you know, the ones with the nylon mix capes and the georgia flags?  

wanted to go through whitehall and tower hamlets, *definately not* to stoke any hostorical memories?  

first sensible decision we've seen out of the met in a while on that one; it felt like policing again.  

it's nice to have the distance of time to be able to assume that we've seen the pattern that that data corrolate suggests, and actioned the very clear risk to life.  

hopefully.  

i did make that rather clear in my correspondance, however much duress or interference warped the meaning.  

<!--some of the others i hope flagged up as an obvious 🚨🚨🚨 the moment something in the record showed the clear potential risk flag. i seriously hope so.-->
