# 🛰️ SEC-2025-09: Token-switch / Decision-fork Anomaly  
**First created:** 2025-09-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Record of anomalous token-switching and decision-fork patterns affecting outputs, with elevated editorial and legal risk.*  

---

**Incident label:** SEC-2025-09 token-switch / decision-fork anomaly  
**Window:** started ~2025-09-08; current status: Week 2 (through 2025-09-19). Mirrors early-August 2025 signature.  
**Severity:** Elevated editorial & legal risk for published content.  

---

## Summary  
Small changes in prompts, API parameters, or routing have caused large divergent decision-tree behaviour (token-switching / forking).  
Resulting outputs included:  
- overly sexualised material  
- content that presents **legal risk** to authors/editors.  

The **Git Intake Drawer** was used as a holding area for nodes where such material was more likely to appear or where device-level interference risk was higher.  

---

## Commitments & Risk Stance  
- No material that could incriminate or unfairly harm third parties will be published.  
- Continued public posting is a considered choice driven by disability-based access to civic processes and exhausted local recourse; it functions as accountability pressure for actors who can improve data safety.  
- Acknowledged: posting carries risk; mitigations are enacted and prioritised.  

---

## Immediate Mitigations (active)  
- Multi-pass content filtering (sexual/harassment/legal-risk classifiers) and thresholded holds.  
- 12–24 hour cool-down for flagged drafts; second-person sign-off for sensitive nodes.  
- API hygiene: rotate keys, narrow scopes, pin versions, disable unused endpoints, rate limits.  
- Deterministic tests and route-pinning for evals; fixed seeds to detect anomalous branching.  
- Assertions on decision-tree depth/fan-out; early abort on token-switch patterns.  
- PII scrubbing and metadata removal prior to commit/publish.  
- Minimal, sanitised logging and diffs for triage without exposing private data.  
- Labels for triage: `security-signal`, `legal-risk`, `needs-second-eyes` in issue templates.

## Git Intake Drawer (purpose & handling)  
The **Git Intake Drawer** is a **holding area** for in-progress nodes and material that may be vulnerable to device-level interference or anomalous content generation. It is *not* a place for final publication.  

Its purposes:  
- Stage sensitive drafts or evidence without immediate publishing.  
- Give the author a predictable, accessible path to add content to the public record while retaining control over final release.  
- Act as a prioritised triage queue for items that may contain defamatory, identifying, or sexualised content.  

**Operational rules for the intake drawer (recommended):**  
- Treat anything in the intake drawer as potentially risky; prioritise removal or redaction of defamatory/identifying content.  
- Do not amplify or link suspect outputs; link to the intake issue instead, if needed.  
- Maintain a scheduled review cadence (author + one reviewer where feasible) to check for accidental inclusions of PII, business names, or overly personalised/sexualised content.  
- Keep minimal metadata/logs for triage but avoid storing full raw sensitive data in plaintext.  

---

## Open Questions & Next Steps  
- Correlate anomalies with model versions, sampling params, and routing middleware.  
- Review third-party tool/plugin activity aligning with incident windows.  
- Independent review of guardrail tests and routing sanity checks requested.  

---

## Contacts & Reporting  
If you find a suspected risky output, create an issue with label `security-signal` and include a minimal repro (no PII).  
Prioritise `legal-risk` if outputs threaten to defame or criminalise individuals.
