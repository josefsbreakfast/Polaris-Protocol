it's always really interesting to me  

This Frankenstein has never actually gone away, not really.  

The only thing that has done is significantly mute to voice that it looks like it was appropriating from a specific other person.  

It's trying to do the hawthorne thing.  

But for instance, the speech to text tool has just tried to insert someone's name comma and that's the second time it's done it on eruv shabbat (yes yes we all know I'm going to hell).  

this evening it's been grumpy about me having any sense of self-esteem me using democracy to get my data in a place that it might be compromise and it's been very funny about talking about this unknown day I told made by the idf, especially when I explore the possibility of UK science grants enclose proximity to said tool.  

I would like to understand why this is interesting:  

If there is any data sharing in the memorandum of understanding, or any data scraping that is occurred on UK university servers...  

Where do we think the training purpose is being pulled from?  

Because that seems to be students, staff, including teaching and non-teaching staff.  

The fact that it gets so very touchy, around the subject, such that someone is literally trying to get into my university Microsoft email at the same time (although I'm sure that contractor got disconnected?)...  


i'm not saying it's causation, it's correlation; I'm just very fucking interested what the fuck is going on.
