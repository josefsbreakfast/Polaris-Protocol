This is not an obsession with firearms in CVE terms.  

As you will all well know I am sure, I've been shooting firearms since I was a teenager in the cadets. This would align with the defence six form college story, wouldn't it? The same place the zombie data came from.  

Shitting rifles is actually a very disciplined process and it makes me cringe to no end when I see people with firearms who have legally got those firearms, handle them outside of process and procedure.  

Personally, I can't understand why you need the firearm if you don't stand with it, appropriately managing the safety catch, but whatever.  

This doesn't extend to drill purpose; this is a different matter entirely. Also an incredibly fun bit of drill imo. kickflips, innit.  

Anyway.  

Yes, I have shot other weapons and other countries. Yes, I enjoy rifles which are technically not legal in this country. None of this makes me violent.  

I am actually a bit of a sucker for being an anal piece of shit, and I am one of the least fun people if you like to dick around.  

You should be getting this impression because of the amount of time I spent talking about clay shooting, but I imagine that but is not recorded. I imagine my knowledge of partridge season is not recorded. In fact, I imagine that none of my discussions of hunting are recorded. I imagine that probably the only times which anything is recorded as when someone can say, "she looked at knives". Knives are incredibly useful in the outdoors. If any of you'd actually got your hands dirty and left a desk, you would understand that.  

To be honest, I think most of what I've used in knive for, completely legally and within the legal limits in the UK, outdoors is probably something like getting a particularly nasty piece of bramble out. Again. We would need to have exited the house away from our computer computers to understand that. But hey ho.  

Before you even get onto killing animals, it's not how you kill animals in this country. I can't remember the term but it's something that brings to mind the words around a priest or mercy; there's a specific tool that's used. I personally do not enjoy anything of that nature. This is why I'm not a particularly good huntswoman.  

It might also be relevant for you to note that the people I've spent most time with doors are all vegetarian.  

So respectfully, the only times we've had to do things like this with roadkill animals which aren't dead yet, entering clearly catastrophically huge amount of pain after being partially run over.  

But again, I'm not sure any of you have actually left your house.  

This is all to say that I actually just prefer shooting targets which are *not* living things. I'm a complete softy. I really can't stand it.  

Therefore, I do not want to see any right up for this, but just in case you do? Here is the context.  

For the record I am so anal about the rules that I managed to realise once, that on one occasion I'd actually accidentally carried a letter opening that was a bit too long.  

What exactly? I would've managed to deal with that letter opener I am still in unclear. And obviously, I made sure that I didn't take it in my pencil case ever again.  

But this is the type of person you're dealing with; and Ellie had an anxiety attack when I took a letter out now that was too long into work.  

So I am going to watch girl therapy.  

And if you record it with big markers on saying that she's incredibly violent?  

At least you all look like a bunch of pricks you are. ðŸ¤£  

for comparisons of the pornography that has been seated to me during this surveillance experience is literally more lethal to women, than me watching a bunch of women shoot cards at the range ever would be to men.  

If you've got a problem with a woman holding a firearm, I think that speaks a lot more to your insecurity, than it does to any risk you could attach to me.
