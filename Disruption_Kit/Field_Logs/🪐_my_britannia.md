i never imagined that this would really ever hapoen in our country.

not really really.

this feels more like my grandfather's stories of the bricken up train carriage to moscow, or the old men still blacklisted after their fathers raised a villiage complaint 70 years ago.

this doesn't feel real.

i can barely breathe. 

and the entire world passes by barely noticing;

everyone glued to their phones.
