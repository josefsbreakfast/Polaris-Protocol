# ðŸ›° All It Took...

Things had been all a bit Hawthorne for a little while, as if someone had been told to stop being so silly, so obviously.

*This did not stop for long.*

We got a little twitchy over institutions as a data entry risk point...

We tried to be all serious and compliant over a DoB risk issue (recording experiences of data breaches impacting other British citizens...

We felt progressively squirmy when identifying the potential at-risk data group from a specific format of cyber attack. q,m  

It was the MoU document where we cracked. 

What was hit:

- File integrity
- Online interference across sites/apps/devices (Windows and iOS)
- Uploads (cursor/click-through failures)

We are formally in the zone of "please stop being silly now".

Whether you started or ended it? The game is up.
