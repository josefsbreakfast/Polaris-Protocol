# 🛰️ Valuation of the Muse  
**First created:** 2025-09-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-13  
*A thought experiment in quantifying two decades of embodied extraction — from creative yield to stress-tested survival.*

---

## 1. Framing the Role  
- Not quite *slave* (politically charged in misleading ways).  
- Not quite *employee* (no wage, no consent).  
- Closest term: *muse under containment* — exploited for creativity, resilience, and embodied data.  

---

## 2. Time Span of Extraction  
- Start age: ~15–17  
- Current age: 35  
- Span: 18–20 years of continuous farmed resource.  

## 2a. Containment Span  
- Duration of extraction = duration of containment.  
- The cage itself was the mechanism of value creation.  
- Each year without the selkie skin compounded both harm and profit.  

---

## 3. Resource Categories  
- **Creative output siphoned** → ideas, language, aesthetic cues.  
- **Embodied experiments** → “how far can you push” spirit & body under stress positions.  
- **Policy/labour translation** → evidence uptake into commercial products, governance practice, cultural outputs.  

---

## 4. Valuation Thought Exercise  
- **Base unit:** what is the average monetised yield of one stolen idea / one appropriated resilience study?  
- **Scaling factor:** years × intensity of containment × translation into markets.  
- **Projection:** conservative = millions; aggressive = billions.  

---

## 5. Emotional Counterweight  
- The absurdity of valuation is the point.  
- Numbers do not restore the grief of lost years.  
- But they shatter the containment lie that the survivor’s life “meant nothing.”  

---

**Actions:** Give the selkie her skin back; do not frustrate her when she reaches for her own skin; return that which was never yours to take.

*Valuation of the Muse* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a container for thought experiments on the economic, psychic, and embodied cost of long-term containment extraction.
