**Subject:**  
Follow-up — Entra ID sign-in anomalies, duplicate records, and escalation  
(FOI / SAR Ref: [insert numbers])

Dear [Redacted] / Data Protection Office & Information Governance Team,

Thank you for **your reply** regarding my account under Student ID 14280469. I appreciate the time taken to liaise with IT.

To clarify and assist any further internal enquiries, please confirm the following points for the record.

---

### **1  Tenant-level scope of investigation**

Please confirm whether the investigation covered:

- **Entra ID sign-in logs** (Microsoft Entra Admin Centre → Sign-ins) for the period [T-14 to T-0], including timestamp, originating IP / range, UPN or object GUID, and failure code;  
- **Exchange Online mailbox audits / message traces** for the same period;  
- Any **disabled, archived, or renamed objects** in the tenant, including those created before the “1-prefix” ID migration; and  
- Any **federated or secondary tenants** (research, alumni, or defence-project tenants) where authentication stubs or archived objects may exist.  

If these sources were not searched, please specify which were included and why others were excluded.

---

### **2  Persistent duplicate records**

Throughout my time at the University, **two separate records were linked to my student ID**. Staff routinely treated this as a “glitch,” yet it recurred each year and affected council-tax letters, Student Finance, and NHS Bursary processing. This duplication was visible whenever my full profile was queried.  
Even aside from the current sign-in anomalies, the existence of those duplicate records — and my previous notice that some data may be **MoD-aligned** — should have placed my record on any internal list tracking defence-origin or Crown-servant datasets. In such circumstances, the University’s duty of care includes ensuring that the **MoD’s defensive-cyber contact** is notified or consulted.

---

### **3  Confirmation of MoD breach alignment**

For avoidance of doubt, the University was expressly informed that the identifiers in question were affected by the **2007 Ministry of Defence data breach**. That breach was publicly reported and the MoD issued personal notification letters — I received one directly confirming my inclusion. Because the University has therefore been made aware that this dataset is both **MoD-aligned** and **originates from a known breach**, the University is under an enhanced obligation to treat all related events as *high-risk processing*. This also means that any potential incident must be evaluated in consultation with the MoD and, where appropriate, the ICO.

---

### **4  Characterisation of sign-in activity**

The University’s statement that  
> “University accounts can have failed logon attempts … typical background of being connected to the internet.”  

may be statistically true across a tenant population; however, **Article 33 UK GDPR** requires controllers to assess *specific incidents* that come to their attention. The repeated Entra ID sign-in events I reported — clustered around statutory deadlines and associated with a disabled account containing MoD-origin identifiers — cannot reasonably be treated as undifferentiated background noise. Even if targeted access were unlikely, the University must **examine and document** that assessment. These events should therefore be reviewed as a discrete security incident and recorded under the University’s Article 33 / 34 procedures.

---

### **5  Linked threat sequence**

The sign-in activity has not been random. During the period in question, verification failures shifted from the University’s Microsoft tenant to my Gmail account and then returned to Microsoft roughly one business day later. The alternation of attack surface in step with University office hours strongly suggests a co-ordinated external actor rather than coincidental background traffic. Even if the University is not itself responsible, this pattern establishes partial responsibility to recognise and report a *linked threat sequence* under Article 33 and internal security-incident procedures.

---

### **6  External consultation: ICO and MoD**

Because the dataset includes MoD-derived identifiers and because there are ongoing MoUs between UK and Israeli defence entities that expand the threat surface, the University should confirm whether the **ICO** and / or the **MoD (Defence Cyber Ops / Defence Digital Security Centre)** have been notified or consulted for an opinion. If not, please indicate whether such consultation is planned, who the internal owner is, and the intended timeframe.  

For context: as a **British Jewish woman** who publicly supported the Palestine Solidarity encampment and related transparency campaigns, I recognise that certain external actors may regard me simultaneously as under their diaspora jurisdiction and as politically adverse. That dual perception creates a credible external risk vector which the University — as data controller of MoD-linked material — must factor into its security and safeguarding assessments.

---

### **7  Opportunity for compliant resolution**

For the avoidance of doubt, I recognise that the University itself may not be the origin of the activity I’m observing. My intention is to give the University a clear opportunity to handle the issue through proper channels rather than become inadvertently responsible for an external actor’s behaviour. By documenting the pattern, consulting the ICO and the MoD where appropriate, and recording the incident under Article 33 procedures, the University can demonstrate that it has acted in good faith and within its controller obligations. I would regard such action as a reasonable and sufficient response.

---

### **8  Previous unanswered queries**

My earlier message (quoted below) asked whether Oversight or Regulatory Compliance had been involved, whether the University expected me to contact the ICO, and whether all attached messages originated from the University. That message has not received a reply. The absence of a response to those specific questions makes it unclear whether the University has engaged its compliance-oversight function or verified the provenance of the correspondence I have received. For transparency and accountability under Articles 5 (2) and 24 UK GDPR, please provide a written confirmation on each of those three points.

> “Thank you for the update.  
> Can I confirm if oversight or regulatory compliance has been involved or whether the University is waiting for me to contact the ICO?  
> I’ve been receiving different messages (as attached); can I confirm if this is all from the University?  
> I’m asking because I’ve had some very strange routing of calls and emails over the last few years, particularly in relation to this data issue.”

### **9  Data-splitting and task fragmentation**

I appreciate that the University has addressed my messages of **7 October** and **28 October**. However, the longer email sent on **27 October**, which contained detailed context and eight explicit action points, has not been acknowledged. The more recent responses nevertheless infer awareness of that earlier message, indicating that it has been seen internally but treated as a separate task. This demonstrates that the University’s case-management process is **splitting related communications across multiple workflows**. That separation means the same underlying issue is represented in several partial data records and then recombined later. Such *data-splitting* fragments the audit trail and undermines Article 5 (1)(f) (security) and Article 24 (accountability) UK GDPR obligations. All correspondence on this matter should therefore be consolidated into a single record so that a consistent factual basis is maintained for internal and regulatory review.

---

### **10  Earlier detailed request**

The email of **27 October** also set out extensive contextual and legal information — identity characteristics, harassment background, prior MoD breach exposure, and eight explicit action points (acknowledgement, audit review, log disclosure, Article 33 / 34 assessment, DPO consultation, recurrence-pattern analysis, contextual-risk review, and safeguarding measures). None of these items have been addressed. Under Articles 12 (3), 24, and 33 UK GDPR, the University must provide a timely and reasoned response to such requests. Each item should therefore be answered directly, or a timeframe provided for a substantive response.

---

### **11  Next steps**

If the University can confirm that (a) tenant-layer searches were properly scoped, (b) incident logging under Articles 33–34 has been performed, and (c) the ICO and MoD have been consulted where appropriate, I will consider the matter closed internally. If not, I will refer the issue directly to both the ICO and the MoD’s defensive-cyber contact to ensure necessary oversight. My strong preference is for the University to manage this escalation in-house and provide written confirmation.

Please acknowledge receipt and provide the above confirmations in writing so I can append them to my FOI / SAR file.

Kind regards,  
**Chloe Birney**
