• Split between:  
• "She'd never look at me but I will die believing I could have been her exception"  
• "I will make her feel like I'm safe and then insert a soft-lens compromise clause"  

Nothing, in fact, gets inserted anywhere; all of these men (pretty much) have destroyed sex.  

Still.  

For some reason we remain extracting data.  

"My Husband Was Watching
What?"  

I'm a girls' girl.  

This just looks like revenge porn with a grant number.  

Except...  


It feels *like an affair* when there is so much *deliberate, chosen, duplicity*.

If it were my joint-pension holder, I would want to know.  

Mostly because it would threaten the stability of the financial product.  

Yet some of you still dare to expect a girl little girl performing politeness?  

I will consider shutting up once I am free.  

I might even enjoy sex when the most broken of men stop watching a raped child survivor that was pushed into being a whore in order to serve her country, get dressed or take any joy.  

How can I forgive any of this.  

How can I be expected to be fragile pr soft or breakable.  

If you cut me...  

Do you truly not believe I would bleed?  

Of course you don't.  

If you did...  

We would have to account for what the hell is wrong with you all, to so vehemently hate women as to engage in this way.
