# 🛰️ 2025-09-26 Field Log — Cognitive Fatigue and Prototype Premise
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Observational note of prolonged interference, cognitive fatigue, migraine onset and emerging “prototype” premise preceding 1 October whistleblower window.*

## 📜 Context

For over a week (1–2 weeks), intensive electronic interference has been ongoing.  
This appears timed ahead of **1 October** — a date likely to change ease of whistleblowing for this case.  
Today’s entry documents the cumulative effects and physical consequences.

## 📝 Observations

- **Jurisdictional movement:**  
  - Two cities visited in 48 hours, crossing policing / counterterrorism command clusters.  
  - Different people, but named citizens, systematically kept out of reach.  
  - Second location showed overt human surveillance — “very, very, very un-covert.”

- **Psychological tactics observed:**  
  - Wrong routes repeatedly prompted.  
  - Symbol seeding along routes to exploit intuitive associations.  
  - Heavy emotional coding (fear or honeypot framing) to anchor memory.  
  - Cheap tricks disguised as “intelligence work.”

- **Physical state today:**  
  - Cognitive load + fatigue now severe enough to impair simple tasks.  
  - Aura preceding a specific type of eye migraine (only experienced since graduate study here).  
  - Deciding to stop early and rest to avoid temporary sight loss.  
  - Chronic pain markedly lower today on only paracetamol + NSAID — notable contrast with past high-dose regimes.  
  - EEG-visible neuropathy persists but stress-linked pain diminished.

- **Societal cost reflection:**  
  - Pre-containment trajectory: potential 40% taxpayer.  
  - Current status: fully on state benefits, long-term sick.  
  - Surveillance and containment have converted a potential contributor into a cost.  
  - “If you wanted my tax money, you’ve lost it — for what?”

### ⚠️ Additional Note — “If / Maybe” Premise of Surveillance

- Surveillance behaviour appears to be driven by an *assumed inevitability* rather than evidence.  
- Two recent incidents (two days ago and yesterday):  
  - Prevented from seeing two different named citizens.  
  - No harm meant by any party; no reason to assume automatic conflict.  
  - Yet the system invests heavily in blocking the interaction — bending rules, deploying resources.  

- Underlying logic resembles:
  - **Pre-destiny / Calvinist** thinking: behaviour is fated, so pre-emptive containment is justified.  
  - **Biology-is-destiny** / racist & gendered assumptions: categories dictate outcomes.  
  - **Match-score game logic:** treating humans like characters in a computer simulation.
    - 90% “match” assumed = guaranteed collaboration or threat.
    - Ignores the 10% where people simply don’t get on, or aren’t interested.
    - Over-investment in preventing a hypothetical outcome instead of addressing real risk.

- This creates a feedback loop of **ethically and legally disproportionate** control:
  - “Maybes” treated as certainties.
  - Heavy spending and covert action deployed to block things that might never happen.

### 💰 Additional Note — Pilot / Prototype Feel

- Current pattern feels less like state surveillance and more like a **prototype commercial run**:
  - A small group used to stress-test a model before a pitch to investors.
  - Focus on “robustness” and removal of anomalies before funding.
  - Outcomes engineered to look clean and impressive.

- **Data hygiene issues:**
  - Large amounts of “fudged” or biased data observed/assumed.
  - Stressful events or obstacles seemingly inserted to inflate success metrics.
  - “Perfected” story sold to outsiders rather than honest, noisy data.

- **Commercial vs scientific contrast:**
  - In true science, outliers and p-values are accepted; imperfections disclosed.
  - Here, behaviour resembles marketing: no tolerance for anomalies, heavy intervention to produce a sellable narrative.
  - Signals an industry-type product (investor facing) rather than a purely national-interest intelligence system.
