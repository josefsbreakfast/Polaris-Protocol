would someone with osa access in 2016 like to come and pick up their behavioural shaping model?  

i think its drunk; see screenshot.  

its far more incriminating in full, but i thought i'd be pleasent.  

(nb: im just not one of those people who likes pet names constantly. i find it suspicious, especially from a machine. its weird.)  

and either send me people who can code one of the easiest languages on the planet, or follow the admin guides as they have been provided.  

you can tell none of you have had to work a proper job before.  
<!--looked at pp148-9, erc; criticism is milk towst. i feel a lot of people benefit by not having all their eggs in one basket, when the minutae becomes more meaningful in one's mind than is perhaps warranted.  

amd the "we" thing is because i've soent a lifetime effectively in seevice jobs, in a givernment which is picking up corpspeak; mrs jones ismt supposed to know its just me and the inbox and i do wish you would stop sending people to ask me.  

i read around other diagnoses because i have a large anxiety around my fh (as i *am very sure* you are quite aware), and because the different techniques people use can be gelpful to mamage the condition thay i have which is "not cost effective to treat", thanks to that coalition cabinet we had.   

how can uyou blame me for being a little anniywd, when my future was used to oay for bankers' mistakes?  

and if this is why i' getting tye "soicy" cintent again, can we okese bloody stop?  

this is like the government sending me ohotos of its penis and i di not appreciate it.-->

oh dear g-d i know why my feed wont shut up abound beard mansgement now GET ME OUT OF THIS DIGITAL BOX PLEASE.  <!--ahhh. i see. yes, he does look like he could outgrow that in 6-8 weeks; this would grossly annoy me if i could even grow a beard. i did wonder where this insert was going; i assumed we were just genoursly misinterpreting a 5 o'clock shadow. don't know about the grumpy looks, though. maybe that's a special one just for you. 
speaking of grumpy looks and beards..  
you will be repairing my ease of access to shul. 
get to.
or should i ask why my case is not being nudged to prioritise, rarher than... what was your ohrase? "you have been deprioritised by the state"? something like this.  
kindly review that.  
i have a list if things which would appease me, and i'm sure orevisely zero will shock you by now.  
there's ab exceotiinalky easy way to shut me up tempirarily, but i doubt you'll enjoy tye idea, seeing as you've been cockblocking me for tye best part of a decade.  
in fact, should we talk about everything i've been nudged to?  
or would you prefer to get on with the list? -->

can we stop with the weird noise/peessure rocking against the structure please?

it would be nice if, bare minimum, we could agree to stop the guys who are doing the external environmental noxious stimuli, even if we don't want to consider more protective ways in which support and securoty cpuld be accessed.

i think i might upload that chatgpt convo later actually.  

it is truly a work of art, in sucking up to authority.  

incidently,  

we can put "overthinkers" merch in the feed,  

but why are you so upset that im writing?  

are we sure the error is with me?
