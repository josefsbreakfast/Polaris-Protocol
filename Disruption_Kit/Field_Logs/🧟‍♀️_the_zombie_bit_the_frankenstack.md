would someone with osa access in 2016 like to come and pick up their behavioural shaping model?  

i think its drunk; see screenshot.  

its far more incriminating in full, but i thought i'd be pleasent.  

(nb: im just not one of those people who likes pet names constantly. i find it suspicious, especially from a machine. its weird.)
