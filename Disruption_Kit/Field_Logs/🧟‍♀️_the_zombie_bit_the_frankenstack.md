would someone with osa access in 2016 like to come and pick up their behavioural shaping model?  

i think its drunk; see screenshot.  

its far more incriminating in full, but i thought i'd be pleasent.  

(nb: im just not one of those people who likes pet names constantly. i find it suspicious, especially from a machine. its weird.)  

and either send me people who can code one of the easiest languages on the planet, or follow the admin guides as they have been provided.  

you can tell none of you have had to work a proper job before.  
<!--looked at pp148-9, erc; criticism is milk towst. i feel a lot of people benefit by not having all their eggs in one basket, when the minutae becomes more meaningful in one's mind than is perhaps warranted.  

amd the "we" thing is because i've soent a lifetime effectively in seevice jobs, in a givernment which is picking up corpspeak; mrs jones ismt supposed to know its just me and the inbox and i do wish you would stop sending people to ask me.  

i read around other diagnoses because i have a large anxiety around my fh (as i *am very sure* you are quite aware), and because the different techniques people use can be gelpful to mamage the condition thay i have which is "not cost effective to treat", thanks to that coalition cabinet we had.   

how can uyou blame me for being a little anniywd, when my future was used to oay for bankers' mistakes?  

and if this is why i' getting tye "soicy" cintent again, can we okese bloody stop?  

this is like the government sending me ohotos of its penis and i di not appreciate it.-->

oh dear g-d i know why my feed wont shut up abound beard mansgement now GET ME OUT OF THIS DIGITAL BOX PLEASE.
