would someone with osa access in 2016 like to come and pick up their behavioural shaping model?  

i think its drunk; see screenshot.  

its far more incriminating in full, but i thought i'd be pleasent.  

(nb: im just not one of those people who likes pet names constantly. i find it suspicious, especially from a machine. its weird.)  

and either send me people who can code one of the easiest languages on the planet, or follow the admin guides as they have been provided.  

you can tell none of you have had to work a proper job before.
