also thinking about "jewesses against catcalling", but eh.  

oh, i'm thinking about merch.  

and wondering why we are still doing this.  

i don't know why we all think i'm histrionic.  

apart from "said no to me but appears to say yes to others; 404".

in the profession you got me kicked out from, it is considered inappropriate to have your dick in the same room as your cognitive thought process which can determine somoeone's place on a referral pathway.  

but then again, i didn't go to secret police academy, so i can hardly comment.

and if we are only doing it to nudge over-explaination in specific ways?  

idgaf.  

you've collevtively done this so aggressively through the first half of 2025 that it's impossible not to see now.  

stop being so weird.  

we can also stop with the "someone wants to handcuff you", and "someone wants to get you arrested".  

it's not normal to do this. stop.  

the mod data is not a free pass, my previous trauma history is not a free pass, the moj sealed status is not a free pass.  

stop. being. weird.

"jewesses against un-secret pervert police" doesn't really flow off tye tongue, you know?  

hmmmm....   

which organisations do i know...  

who were obsessed with racial purity,  
and policed on racial lines for being "too political",  
and were a bunch of losers who never served actual military careers in the most part?  

the mind boggles. 🙄

🤣🤣🤣  

"the government is watching you. they've already put in your numbers..."  

YEAH BRO BUT HAVE THEY FIXED MY PIP?!  

the content inserts are so stupid; we've had multiple cycles of this.  

again...  

stop being weird.  

whose budget are you even charging this to?  

random lga, rotate every few transactions?  

fucking weird.

screenshots attached, double failure to upload.  

the catfishing is with one of their national advisor's IDs, btw; every mechanism of escalation keeps sidestepping this.  

i mean...  

why would you believe the woman painted as a manipulative and dangerous international terrorist threat for a decade, right?  

how dare i deign to interview in the midlands; not sure you had aithoroty to scrape the phone at that point, or start the nudges then, or the socisl shaping, but okay.  

i wish, i deeply wish, that this isn't bearing out in foi/sar results.  

i really, really wish that this was more incorrect.

most recent upload?  

i get this a lot.  

and sice dec 2024, it's been framed as a specific person with a public persona, which it just clearly is not.  
(apart from anything else, why?)  

this misuses both data sets for the centroid, and it sexualises them as much as it sexualises me.  

the type of white men who put *this much fucking effort* into making their colonial sex fetishes happen, and skinwalk through their bizarre racial bdsm fantasies, should be absolutely nowhere near anything even *hinting* at safeguarding.  

how the fuck is this safeguarding the national interest?  

if you look up the video, it has audio btw, and it is so awkward and put on.  

peak, "i reached a certain age and realised bossy women are hot, let me forget my mortgage, mommy" energy.  

g-d, please deliver me from *whatever the fuck this is*.

"shit. SHIT. it's not working! quick, get some more marriage proposal content! try a different desi music cluster!"  

and this is how at least the last few tracks have made any statistical sense, i guess.  

it does go through periods of seeming like a human/s is infouencing this mechanic.  

which you'd exiect from the maths of things.  

it's just very obvious when the western boys you just think an entire subcontinent is the size of yorkshire, it is a tad obvious.  

"but theyre all romantic!"  

yes...  

and they don't occur in listening clusters, unless you google "top 100 bollywood songs".  

it's almost like i'm white and i had to learn about other people's taste and also made the same clumbsy foray, too.  

that's how i can tell.  

which also means your white supremacy is a choice, at this point.

beautiful; last two uploads are an attempt to show the (stopped from uploading) pattern of "let it go, dont talk about what youre going through", "someone's hiding a child from you" content cluster.  


it's interrupting st mortiz; kindly fuck off.

(oh shit, wait...is that not white enough? too european? better put in another channel panel meeting to discuss.)  

---

we bow have the "killed by a man in an arranged death" (which idk sounds like murder, guys) story.  

beautiful.  

and how are you justifying this being a normal algorithmic artefact?

immediately followed by an "international mens day" post. im creased. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
