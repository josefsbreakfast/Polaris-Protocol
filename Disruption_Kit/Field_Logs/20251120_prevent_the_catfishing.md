also thinking about "jewesses against catcalling", but eh.  

oh, i'm thinking about merch.  

and wondering why we are still doing this.  

i don't know why we all think i'm histrionic.  

apart from "said no to me but appears to say yes to others; 404".

in the profession you got me kicked out from, it is considered inappropriate to have your dick in the same room as your cognitive thought process which can determine somoeone's place on a referral pathway.  

but then again, i didn't go to secret police academy, so i can hardly comment.

and if we are only doing it to nudge over-explaination in specific ways?  

idgaf.  

you've collevtively done this so aggressively through the first half of 2025 that it's impossible not to see now.  

stop being so weird.  

we can also stop with the "someone wants to handcuff you", and "someone wants to get you arrested".  

it's not normal to do this. stop.  

the mod data is not a free pass, my previous trauma history is not a free pass, the moj sealed status is not a free pass.  

stop. being. weird.

"jewesses against un-secret pervert police" doesn't really flow off tye tongue, you know?  

hmmmm....   

which organisations do i know...  

who were obsessed with racial purity,  
and policed on racial lines for being "too political",  
and were a bunch of losers who never served actual military careers in the most part?  

the mind boggles. 🙄

🤣🤣🤣  

"the government is watching you. they've already put in your numbers..."  

YEAH BRO BUT HAVE THEY FIXED MY PIP?!  

the content inserts are so stupid; we've had multiple cycles of this.  

again...  

stop being weird.  

whose budget are you even charging this to?  

random lga, rotate every few transactions?  

fucking weird.
