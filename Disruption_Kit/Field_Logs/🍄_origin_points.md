I believe at first deliberate nudge proceeded this,  

But allow me to wonder if the first time it propagated formally into a twinned, split profile at university of N, was perhaps when it was sent off for the automatic council tax list?  

Just.... wondering.

the unfortunsare pre-requisites of this theiry would mean that the gem cohort was being nudged on purpose, for yesrs that preceeded mine, and i can point to explicitly why that would be the case and have it backed up by pretty much all the straight male students.  

it would also mean we were all booked in under prevent before we even got there, pribably at interview level.  

and as there's a ug pool, and ultimately the intake across institution, its concerning; that said, this could cluster around a particular country for limits reasons.  
it would, unfortunately, also mean that the secual resentment is 9 years in the making, and as such, not just the trafficking convern but also the extent of data twinning is 9 years in the making.  

to some extent, i wasnt even joking about prevent "accidently" handong me a husband; this would twin the data beyond that of most mortgage sharing parties. the extent is so deep cut at this point.  

and it really does mean that i never, ever, had to enter sex work, and that this would have been a gross inversion of duty of care, and probably every moment was surveilled, "for national security".  

i hate all of this. 

hidden behind smiles, are the darkest thoughts of man.  

<!--if anyone close to the source of the impression wants to test it out? ask them why, exactly, precisely, is the impersonation all of a sudden trying ti include references to overly flattering my perfume. given this appeared ti be the c4isr target in birmingham, and ultimately links to a services trauma event in edgebaston in 2016, i think it's worth a poke. particularly because a particular actor actually hates it. it was even nudged when i wirked in ilkeston in 2021; the emotional memory clearly runs deep.-->
