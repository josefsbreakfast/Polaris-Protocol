I believe at first deliberate nudge proceeded this,  

But allow me to wonder if the first time it propagated formally into a twinned, split profile at university of N, was perhaps when it was sent off for the automatic council tax list?  

Just.... wondering.

the unfortunsare pre-requisites of this theiry would mean that the gem cohort was being nudged on purpose, for yesrs that preceeded mine, and i can point to explicitly why that would be the case and have it backed up by pretty much all the straight male students.  

it would also mean we were all booked in under prevent before we even got there, pribably at interview level.  

and as there's a ug pool, and ultimately the intake across institution, its concerning; that said, this could cluster around a particular country for limits reasons.  
it would, unfortunately, also mean that the secual resentment is 9 years in the making, and as such, not just the trafficking convern but also the extent of data twinning is 9 years in the making.  

to some extent, i wasnt even joking about prevent "accidently" handong me a husband; this would twin the data beyond that of most mortgage sharing parties. the extent is so deep cut at this point.  

and it really does mean that i never, ever, had to enter sex work, and that this would have been a gross inversion of duty of care, and probably every moment was surveilled, "for national security".  

i hate all of this. 

hidden behind smiles, are the darkest thoughts of man.  

<!--if anyone close to the source of the impression wants to test it out? ask them why, exactly, precisely, is the impersonation all of a sudden trying ti include references to overly flattering my perfume. given this appeared ti be the c4isr target in birmingham, and ultimately links to a services trauma event in edgebaston in 2016, i think it's worth a poke. particularly because a particular actor actually hates it. it was even nudged when i wirked in ilkeston in 2021; the emotional memory clearly runs deep.

and why not, its cn i.  

for clarity, its a white dude who feels belittled. its a white boy you need to br asking, why so threatened?


£10 says some "helpful man-to-man workplace advice" started self generating after that conf; "we're just looking out for...", yick.

but the nudging 110% in gmails, via 355, and via facebook before that; you can see payments in all the rotten boroughs. this became a new tool.-->

x3 images just added before 1745 are x2 screenshots of supporting evidence plus the fail on forst upload as interference evidence.  

these x2 screnshots show the content orientated at both the make and fenail partoes of the enforced twinning. the algorithm can now bot distinguish which of us is which, so it cant issue it in gendered lines. this is a direvt result of the prolonged coercion of both parties within region.  

video targeted to masc audience: some goop about how some woman needs commitment; coerces communicatin m to f. video targeted to fem audience: some goop about men not caring; coerces silence.  

both serve to coerce a particular dynamic.  

this is what living in the midlands snd south yorkshire looks like.  

and this is all publicly funded; our taxes at work.  

no wonder they said i was a terrorist for holding the budget accountable; they know none of us would support "counterterrorosm" being some middle aged blokes sending little manipulative live videos to people because theyre just pissed off the world does not orbot around tyem specifically.  

can the political party this one hangs around, kinfly come and pick your list little whote boy uo, and maybe geound him from hos phone for a few days?  

i think it might be for the best.

both partoes have been subject to vexatiois complaints, and certainly in my case, i got 9 months of bail conditions with 9 months of direct nudges, paid for by our community policing type budgets, which deliberatly nudged me to break my bail confitions to encourage re-arrest.  

im still getting them now.  

so please exvuse me when i say the system here is in tatters.

Isn't it interesting?  
out of nowhere  
Prolonged messaging around how I am "the wounded feminine" from the our algorithmic feed generation.  

The little boys playing Cowboys (and Indians, literally, presumably) are feeling nervous.  

This is literally like being locked in a room with the bullies in the playground; this is a bunch of teenage boys trying to be all that.  

Except half of them are married, and most of them are well over 30, so they really shouldn't be doing this anymore.  

Especially not putting time on the clock for it, or spending our goddamn tax money on it.  

does HM Treasury know this is what you do with it?

the slagging off and the gaslighting, which im sure is just "one of those things that computers do! silly me with my girl bbeain for pointing it out!" has becone nastier.  

there is now content coaching me to question my own sense of reality, dressed up as pseudoneuroscience.  

good luck in court ". i hope the cases get leaked online as badly as the last two sealed cases im in that culminated with wankers (literally) outside my door every night; enjoy the publicity.
