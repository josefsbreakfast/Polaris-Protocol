I understand you may already be considering protective measures. 

I am beyond my limit. 

I am willing to relocate to safe accommodation with active protection. 

Please confirm next steps or who can speak to me about this.  

Beyond a certain point, I have no further choice than to consider my government to be actively prolonging this treatment.  

I would say I can't go on, but I'm stubborn and I always do.  

I am so close to not being able to get back up for a long time.  

I know I am being unkind.  

I am so tired.  

tldr im good, you can let me go now. i want out.
