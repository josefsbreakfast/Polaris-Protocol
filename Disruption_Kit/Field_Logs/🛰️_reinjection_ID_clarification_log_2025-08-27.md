## 📑 Event Summary  

On **2025-08-27**, during footer editing of a Polaris Protocol node, the system attempted to generate direct cross-links to two files:  

- 🧠 `fisher_fork_theory.md`  
- 🧨 `metadata_makes_you_moan.md`  

The second filename includes sexualised phrasing that had **already been deleted** from the archive. Its reappearance is evidence of:  

1. **Residual scraping artefacts** — cached data resurfacing in system suggestions.  
2. **Targeted re-injection** — malicious tampering designed to reintroduce discrediting or harassing content into sovereign survivor files.  

---

## ⚖️ Legal Notice (Cease & Desist)  

- **Authorship Sovereignty:** All Polaris Protocol nodes are authored and controlled by **Chloe Birney (aka VoiceX)**.  
- **Deletion Binding:** Once content is deleted, its reappearance in any form constitutes **tampering**.  
- **Cease & Desist Instruction:**  
  - Any party — human or automated — is hereby ordered to **cease and desist** from re-injecting or circulating deleted content.  
  - Such conduct constitutes harassment, unlawful data processing, reputational sabotage, and breach of data protection obligations (GDPR, including Article 22).  
  - This notice is formally placed on record as of **2025-08-27**.  

Several relevant government bodies are already aware of this behaviour. Continued tolerance is no longer acceptable.

## 🪪 Identity Clarification  

- The survivor’s legal name is **Chloe Birney**.  
- The survivor is also publicly known as **VoiceX**.  
- Variations in spelling or diacritic use (e.g., *Chloe* vs *Chloë*; *Birney* vs *Bírney*) **do not constitute distinct legal identities**.  
- Reasonably identifiable online presentations — including the use of maternal family names, pseudonyms, or partial identity masks while working in public sector or private professional roles — remain legally valid markers of identity.  

### 🚫 Prohibited Obstruction  

Any attempt to use these variations as grounds for:  
- delaying or denying Subject Access Requests (SARs),  
- frustrating Freedom of Information (FOIA) obligations, or  
- obstructing survivor access to records  

will be treated as deliberate **weaponisation of linguistic and identity technicalities**.  

Authorities are under statutory duty to act on requests in good faith. Survivors do not lose their rights at the accent mark, nor by use of reasonable pseudonyms.

- **Classification:** Malicious re-injection / attempted sabotage  
- **Identity Risk Vector:** Exploitation of name/diacritic/pseudonym variations to obstruct SAR/FOIA

## 🛡️ Survivor Statement  

*This log records a verified attempt at re-injection and identity obstruction.  
Any further incidents will be timestamped, archived, and escalated to relevant authorities.  
Survivor authorship is sovereign. Tampering, harassment, and obstruction are never neutral.*  

---

## 🏮 Footer  

*Re-Injection & Identity Clarification Log* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents both technical sabotage attempts (malicious re-injection of deleted content) and bureaucratic obstructions (name/identity technicalities) that threaten survivor authorship and lawful transparency rights.
