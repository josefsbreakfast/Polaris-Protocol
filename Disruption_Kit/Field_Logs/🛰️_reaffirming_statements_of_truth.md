# 🛰️ Field Log — Reaffirmation of Statements of Truth
**First created:** 2025-10-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-21  
*Clarifying circular-logic narratives and reaffirming professional integrity.*

---

## 🧭 1️⃣ Context  
Recent alterations in algorithmic and feed behaviour have prompted me to reaffirm two earlier **statements of truth** issued after the Oxford-related harassment incident.  
These statements concern **two male professionals** and reflect my direct personal knowledge.

---

## 📜 2️⃣ Statements Reaffirmed  
I continue to stand by both statements in full.  
Each was issued under my legal name, after deliberate consideration, and remains an accurate representation of my understanding.  
They were written to counter the possibility of **false or misleading harassment claims** attributed to me through prior cyber-abuse activity.

---

## 🔁 3️⃣ Observed Narrative Pattern  
A hypothetical narrative appears to suggest that my testimony could be discounted on the basis of supposed personal attraction.  
This reasoning is **circular and invalid**:

1. **Attraction ≠ fabrication.**  Feelings do not determine factual accuracy.  
2. **Motive-substitution fallacy.**  It replaces evidence with conjecture about motive.  
3. **Relevance error.**  Personal sentiment is immaterial to questions of conduct.  
4. **Logical contradiction.**  It assumes honesty requires emotional neutrality.  
5. **Manipulative framing.**  The tactic functions to discredit rather than verify.

Therefore, even if we caught a fish, it wouldn't be of much use, because the logic is inherently self-collapsing.  

Frankly, I said what I said, and I have no particular reason to resind either statement; it is extremely clear to me that neither gentleman is responsible for the course of conduct which is the point of complaint, and this has been extensively evidenced.

## ⚖️ 4️⃣ Professional Integrity Record  
Across *Polaris Protocol* and related outputs my behaviour demonstrates consistent professional caution:  
- I revise tone and content when corrections are required.  
- I redact institutional identifiers where disclosure could cause harm.  
- I treat satire and critique as ethical instruments, not licence for recklessness.  

---

## 📣 5️⃣ Prior Cease-and-Desist Notice  
I previously issued a **public cease-and-desist statement online**, which received significant visibility within the same monitoring and surveillance networks observed earlier.  
A marked drop in analytics indicated broad compliance.  
**For any remaining actors continuing to engage in active content placement or feed manipulation:**  

> This continued exposure is logged as part of an ongoing pattern of harassment.  
> Any deliberate injection of material into my viewstream contrary to that cease-and-desist is noted as **continuation of contact after notice**.

---

## 🚫 6️⃣ Standing Request  
If any negotiation, monitoring, or algorithmic process is attempting to erode my credibility or provoke reaction, I reject that frame entirely.  
I restate that:  
- My previous statements of truth remain valid.  
- My expectation of professional respect and non-interference remains in force.

---

## 💬 7️⃣ Final Note on Context and Boundaries  
Requests or manipulations designed to elicit **public declarations of affection or loyalty toward specific male figures** are inappropriate and outside social and professional norms.  
Such framing **undermines my autonomy and personal privacy**, including the ability to form relationships free from surveillance or coercive commentary.  

If such behaviour is intended as irony or performance, it directly obstructs normal life and should **cease immediately**.  
My legal identity has already been made public in litigation that triggered extensive online abuse.  
Given that exposure, it is unreasonable to expect further self-disclosure of a personal nature.  

There remains a **systemic lack of effective witness-protection mechanisms** for people in comparable positions in the UK; continued disregard contributes to sustained harassment.  

> **I therefore consider ongoing attempts of this nature to constitute potential intimidation of a witness.**  
> **I require that this behaviour stop immediately.**  
> Any further attempts will be logged as harassment or intimidation, not legitimate communication.
