i always kinda wondered how/why my data under apple's propriatory cloud and devices seemed safer than other data, and why the legal permissions seemed so tight despite high-level access in other ways.  

guess that bridge got burned some time ago huh.  

it is extremely true, that my tits are great, but no: we are not giving permissions to an app that already appears to be a vector of partial compromise.  

we seed no ground until demands are met.  

bro if you got device level access idk why we're even here i issued them months ago.  

you think you got power? prove it.  

looks like sticking your divk in a bunch of api plugs to me.  

(i heard wrapping the thing in a little tin foil "hat" works really well.)  

....  

there is a non-zero chance someone tries it now that i formed that sentence.  

please dont use behavoural modification tools for that...  

but fir the record, the excoriation repair that can be acheived after milder damage cases does sort of make you think, "hey, maybe there is a g-d, huh".  

Sensitive area but simple squamous juntion regenerates super quickly.  

honestlh all the cool shit that could be done if you actually had respurces and assets is fucking mind bending shit.  

wasting it on this fr.  

but as we know.  

i have been saying stuff like this...  

albeit in my private convos and drafts...  

for fuckkng YEARS.  

so that exploitation money?  

it be mine by tort, innit.  

might help fix the nhs.  

oh and don't worry.  

if you don't want the court case?  

i am *extremely good* at helping very rich men spend their money.  

cast your mind back to 2020; i have not changed *in the fucking slightest*.  

al nobel, man.  

the obvious "out" is *right fucking there*.  

the funniest thing is...  

that would actually, by the grace of the west's own hypocracy...  

be the biggest "fuck you" move you could do.  

and don't worry;  

anything at all that powerful men do, that has any positive impact or beneficial longevity at all, is because:  

- a woman told them to;
- a woman said it first;
- thet were trying to impress a specific woman.

usually sone mixture of the 3. ðŸ™„  


and that's why every expression of political hypermasculinity fails;  

the system favours equilibrium.  

not unlike, as we have extensively discussed, the principles set forth by le chatelier.  

stop letting the smart kids' team down.  

3.5 does not get that reputation from the structure but from attitude of its fans.
