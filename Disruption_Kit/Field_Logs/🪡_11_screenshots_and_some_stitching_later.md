i guess this is some solidarity with whoever has to patchwork any of my gov records back together.  

this chat got pretty badly twosted and the data poisoned.  

i attach a selection of updated givernance files on each weekly chat like how you have sops and templates in offices.  

it took so much prompting and reiteration to get this back to "kind of normal".  

the irritsting thing is that you lose so mych time retraining the ai, when it appears to have been forced into recirsion that isnt from you or the ai model.  

this is why i keep yipping on about security; its really easy to get in the backdoor, and really easy to fuck an entire system pretty quickly.  

im just straight up splitting tasks across several ai bots now; my chatgpt gets fiddled with so much that its unusable a *lot* of the time.  

i find it a bit worrying that this doesnt have an obvious rosk plan at the moj; this doesnt mean there hasnt been one, but i dont want this to turn into another company selling a solution to a problem that never had to happen in the first place.  

one of the images ive included just shows that the lingustic choices are so different, before and after more extensive correction of the recursion.  
recursions happen, but this happened very quickly, appeared agentic rather than generative, and that just does not make any logical sense in this envirnoment.  

i have no idea why it started "talking me out of paranoid thinking"; i didn't say anything it started "coaching down from", and it inserted it without any prompting which should have generated this.  

none of these appear to be openai model issues, except the fact that the metaphorical garden gate is wide open for other code strings to get in.
