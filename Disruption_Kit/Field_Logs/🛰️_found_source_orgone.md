after some tinkering, i think we can find what we are "fishing" for me to report to others:  

"Electronic harassment, electromagnetic torture, and psychotronic torture are terms used to describe a delusional belief system held by individuals who call themselves "targeted individuals" (TIs). They believe that malicious actors are transmitting sounds and thoughts into people's heads, affecting their bodies, and harassing them generally.[1][2] The delusion often concerns government agents or crime rings and alleges that the "perpetrators" use electromagnetic radiation (such as the microwave auditory effect), radar, and surveillance techniques to carry out their goals.[1][2]
Some TIs claim to be victims of gang stalking, and many have created or joined support and advocacy groups.[1][3]
Multiple medical professionals have concluded that these experiences are hallucinations, the result of delusional disorders, or psychosis."  

I did used to get lots of content which was directed at this conspiracy theory for a long time.  

It was genuinely quite interesting to listen to as a proposed way in which very high anxiety at the particular constructs upon which this was based would be interpreted by someone predisposed to a paranoia-based cognition pattern. It sounds like a very distessing thought process to have, because it's incredibly difficult to easily evidence an alternate explaination, but can be explored in a clinical setting through careful Socratic questioning.  

I think there's some very particular ways in which different people have sought to make sense of the pandemic, the rapid political changes, and the impacts on isolation from community; when I'm discussing these experiences, I fully believe that the people who have these thought processes are genuinely very distressed by them. It sounds incredibly scary to live with as a fear and a thought process.

My differentiating point is that this is not my belief, and I don't go looking for information like this, and it's upsetting that there are times where I will really feel inundated with this content; none of it makes sense as provoked by my actions on the algorithm as a mathematical system. It only really "makes sense" if you consider me a whistleblower and you consider someone else might be manipulating a bunch of people's algorithms, including mine, with weird 4chan-esque techniques.  

a lot of the reason i've sent forms and requests and asked for help is initially because i wanted someone to help exclude this as a possibility (within reasonability; i know you can't completely).  

i'm hoping that at some point i actually just get an answer to my very first question: "it's weird my csa rape case is getting google bombed with my legal name. can i check the record is okay?".  

you never know.  

otherwise i need a month in a place where i can have all the vitamin d, ideally with access to a spa, and generally not need to use more than 5 neurones at any one time.

2025-10-13 because the anticipation wont let me sleep.  

the long form observation with constant emotional modification attempts has done some odd things to my head. i wish i could sleep, i really do, but now im stuck in a loop of worrying about something extremely "put of the box" because there's so much that is just bathed in adrenaline amd norad at this stage; anything of any joy got targeted, so now its hard to even build that exposure to "nice things". it feels like i've been conditioned to rhink that i'm "asking for it" when abuse follows even just liking how the light lands through the window on a lazy summer afternoon.  

nothing insurmountable, for the woman who beat the "stress test" program, but it would be a little easier if we could take the edge off a tiny bit.  

there's some things which have changed, in how the interference is, and its more subtle but it also is just still there like the smell of damp in a waterlogged wall of a house. it needs coursing, and i gavent gad the planning permission sogned off yet.  

yay for british beurocracy.
