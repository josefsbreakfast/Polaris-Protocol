# 🛰️ Field Log — Proximity to Experiments: Counterfactual St George’s 2016  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Hypothesis that attending St George’s (London) in 2016 would have increased exposure to early behavioural-insight pilots, and that displacement to Nottingham reduced that proximity.*

---

## 🌐 Summary  
The subject reflects that if they had attended **St George’s, University of London** in 2016, they would likely have been closer to early Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) health pilots. Instead, being nudged toward **Nottingham** may have reduced direct observation of these interventions.  

---

## 📍 Observed Dynamics  
- **BIT focus areas (2010–2016):** HMRC (tax compliance), DWP (benefits/job-seeking), NHS & DH (organ donation, obesity, smoking cessation), NICE collaborations.  
- **London proximity:** St George’s sits within geographic and institutional reach of BIT health pilots and ministerial oversight.  
- **Counterfactual:** placement at St George’s could have exposed the subject to a higher density of behavioural interventions.  
- **Hypothesis:** displacement to Nottingham functioned as a limiting mechanism, reducing the chance of detecting anomalies.  

---

## 📝 Extension — Memory of “Test-Like” Nudge  
- The decision toward Nottingham carried a **“behavioural psychology test 101” feel**.  
- Striking because it felt *constructed* rather than organic.  
- The event is disproportionately memorable relative to its weight in life history.  
- Logged here as an **anomaly of presentation**, not evidence of motive.  

---

## 🔎 Why This Matters  
- **Observational sensitivity:** those inclined to notice subtle anomalies may provide unplanned scrutiny of early pilots.  
- **Democratic implication:** displacement away from pilot zones could systematically suppress early detection of harms (sludge, inequity).  
- **Recordkeeping:** documenting the hypothesis ensures analysts can cross-reference *pilot sites* with *personal displacement*.  
- **Memory anomalies:** events that “stick” unnaturally may signal test-like framing.  

---

## ⚠️ Caution  
- This is a **hypothesis**, not an evidentiary claim.  
- No direct evidence exists that St George’s ran BIT pilots in 2016.  
- The “test-like” quality is recorded descriptively, not as proof of intent.

*Field Log — Proximity to Experiments: Counterfactual St George’s 2016* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records the subject’s reflection on displacement away from early behavioural pilot zones and the anomalous “test-like” feel of the nudge itself.
