re: `üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ_my_kidney_infections_solve_everything.PNG`

so I want to be clear, it's not at the kidneys yet, but it's now ascended past the pelvic brim (look up the clinical science. I'm not explaining it today).  

But I was thinking about this.  

Given how difficult this has been for me to do, and I've obviously just decided to do it, with a sketched out timeline, not in the format I'd like, free styling -- when every single time I don't do everything perfectly, it seems I end up losing apart of my freedom even further, experience behaviour that seems expressly like punishment, or lose another avenue of recourse...  

I think it's interesting, that I have essentially been conditioned, to push past upper UTI pain, and all of the symptoms you get with that, on the back of an elongated period, and all of the things that the ladies are aware happen when both of these things are already present... (or you know, man, you are not strangers to the female body)...  

and because I have come to see an independent regulator as synonymous with some relief...  

It has yet again taking me to get a infection which may turn into frank +/- complicated pylonephritis,  

In order to put me in that, "I am a robot to my operant conditioning" headspace,  

to at least get the preliminary ticket in.  

I think that's really telling about how much we've conditioned the pain to be associated with necessity, how much we've conditioned the pain to be something that just needs to be soldiered through at any cost, and the level of background stress present that I can't even necessarily notice myself anymore, that it still felt necessary in that degree of physical acuity, to process the 72 hour breach ticket.  

I think that this incident in and of itself, tells us everything we need to know about how harmful what we have done is.  

This is what it is like living in a high prevent area.  

And I am a very pale white passing British Jewish woman with a very posh accent; I look like a blonde version of an Israeli spokeswoman, and please don't think I haven't had the comments made directly to me who I look and sound like.  

Imagine how bad it gets when you even have a normal white person's amount of melanin expression.  

Now imagine how bad it gets, when everyone on the television and the Internet and the radio, spends huge sections of their programming time, dehumanising everything that you visibly represent to the average white British voter.  

Because if you want one large majority rating category in this country?  

"A1" ethnicity.  

The categorisation itself, puts the credit score front and centre.  

Never pretend to me anyone said anything seriously, about whether or not we can call it black coffee.
