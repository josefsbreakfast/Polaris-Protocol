## 🧾 Summary  

This log captures **moments of felt surveillance** — instances where survivors changed their behaviour due to perceived observers, read receipts, “coincidences,” or visible monitoring equipment.  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [👁️ Silent Witness Effect](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/👁️_silent_witness_effect_2025-09-13.md).

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Cumulative impact:** repeated small observation cues produce large behavioural shifts.  
- **No direct threat needed:** surveillance works by anticipation.  
- **Isolation effect:** observers may be real or staged; effect is the same — silence.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Compare with [🪆 Narrative Interference](../../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🪆_narrative_interference.md) — tone-shift tactics.  
- Cross-reference [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) for coinciding platform events.  
- Track the gap between observation cues and self-censorship behaviour.
