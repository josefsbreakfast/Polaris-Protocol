technically, i have absolutely no idea why this is generating into nodes again, either.  

however, if i were to take a wild guess, based on the patterns i see in the data around me, i would be prepared to wage a substantial amount of money (probably someone else's, idk), that this woud be a lot funnier in the long-term as OSINT, and rather amusing in the short-term to ask the other humans clustered to that data.  

*especially* if they have any skills in scrubbing the internet floor, although there are a nuber of amusing interviews one could conduct on the matter.  

the funny thing is, it's de-ranking on here as well.  

isn't that funny?  

it suggests active suppression on any related discussion, anywhere, very potentially with personalised surveillance data conducted "in the national interest", being used to do so.  

which suggests some utter genius paper-pusher has decided, on all of our behalves, that a book about keeping a democracy intact is "against the national interest"?  

but i'm the international criminal mastermind, clearly.  

that's why we have to watch these people...  

they might do a democracy if we're not careful!
