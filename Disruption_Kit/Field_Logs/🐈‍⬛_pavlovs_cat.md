serious note:  

is whatever makes the noise still here?  

because he does still arrive, as he has now, meows like a kitten (otherwise v quiet cat), and looks between me and this one specific ceiling light, dribbling wil homer simpson chasing that gummie.  

i dont hate it, and its quite sweet, but he's being very obvious.  

tbf he's just operatong as per protocol; clearly no one told him to stfu about the churro.  

touch him and i will touch you, even less pleasently.  

or we can keep pretending to cabinet that none of you did anything at all, which went slightly "off books"?
