at this point, it's really just asking for the barest acknowledgement of, "yes, we see that *something* happened to you, and we'll look into it".  

everyone is operating on risk registers and panic (and probably too much taurine), that no one can manage that.  

so now i'm stuck divining whatever the metadata spits out.  

given that what i have seen could be phrased in far more scandalous ways, i would really appreciate the "we'll look into it for you" email.  

much as i have thrown a lot of shit at the tech bro crowd who read polaris (and everything else), if you all miscategorised a jew for writing wheat poetry, or if a safeguarding report went wrong, or hey - if someone bought that blackmarket mod leak from nearly 20 years ago on the darkweb - i don't think i care as much as i care about honesty.  

i'm extropolating what *could* have flagged me as an individual, even if extremely far from the point, and trying to understand wtf happened.  

the tech bros are bad at talking to women; we have established this.  

but whatever *this* is, is not exactly helping the "difficulties with fundamentally trusting the world or power structures to be places of safety" element of the complex ptsd diagnosis.  

because that's what is "wrong" with me; i find it difficult on a pathologically significant level to trust authority, because when my brain was developing, it was violently misused to harm me severely.  

which is why i'm surprised that you find the listening to the anarchists even if i disagree with them surprising if i like to have a system where we vote in federation.  

we're talking about "this is what trauma looks like"; not everything is "the marxists!".  

you sound like my late grandfather; hours upon hours of "why communism bad".  
<!--the man learned basic arabic because he thought the bbc wasn't reading it angrily enough to him. and you wonder why i'm asking, "are you sure you're not slightly prejudging the intent"? the man also had a very long explanation about why tony blair was the start of the rise of fascism, and i still can't piece all of the steps together to make it "work". i know about what elders + tv looks like. it looks like learning mandarin so you can argue with the red book when THERE WERE ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS WHEREVER THEY SOLD THE SAME BOOK, SIR. tbf I think one of the kids got him that just for the lols.-->
