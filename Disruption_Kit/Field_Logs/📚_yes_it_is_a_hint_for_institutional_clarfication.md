at this point, it's really just asking for the barest acknowledgement of, "yes, we see that *something* happened to you, and we'll look into it".  

everyone is operating on risk registers and panic (and probably too much taurine), that no one can manage that.  

so now i'm stuck divining whatever the metadata spits out.  

given that what i have seen could be phrased in far more scandalous ways, i would really appreciate the "we'll look into it for you" email.  

much as i have thrown a lot of shit at the tech bro crowd who read polaris (and everything else), if you all miscategorised a jew for writing wheat poetry, or if a safeguarding report went wrong, or hey - if someone bought that blackmarket mod leak from nearly 20 years ago on the darkweb - i don't think i care as much as i care about honesty.  

i'm extropolating what *could* have flagged me as an individual, even if extremely far from the point, and trying to understand wtf happened.  

the tech bros are bad at talking to women; we have established this.  

but whatever *this* is, is not exactly helping the "difficulties with fundamentally trusting the world or power structures to be places of safety" element of the complex ptsd diagnosis.  

because that's what is "wrong" with me; i find it difficult on a pathologically significant level to trust authority, because when my brain was developing, it was violently misused to harm me severely.  

which is why i'm surprised that you find the listening to the anarchists even if i disagree with them surprising if i like to have a system where we vote in federation.  

we're talking about "this is what trauma looks like"; not everything is "the marxists!".  

you sound like my late grandfather; hours upon hours of "why communism bad".  
<!--the man learned basic arabic because he thought the bbc wasn't reading it angrily enough to him. and you wonder why i'm asking, "are you sure you're not slightly prejudging the intent"? the man also had a very long explanation about why tony blair was the start of the rise of fascism, and i still can't piece all of the steps together to make it "work". i know about what elders + tv looks like. it looks like learning mandarin so you can argue with the red book when THERE WERE ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS WHEREVER THEY SOLD THE SAME BOOK, SIR. tbf I think one of the kids got him that just for the lols. this is why it looks silly to millenials and downwards; we are just seeing all our grandparents argue with the bbc, but now it's in government office. generational thing, perhaps. yes, sadly that makes you over 21, probably. welcome to the golden years, where you can eat ice cream at 3am *just because*.-->
given what happened with the whole safeguardin flag/foia debacle, on top of what i had to send to the ico this week, one can see why i'm in a bit of a bind when people say "just call crisis", no?  

firstly: it's not a mental health crisis, so we are not pissing that resource up the wall like that.  

secondly, are any of the data processes in place for confidentiality? unclear.  

so even if i'm very distressed, i am constantly being made to choose how much to disclose because *i don't know if that's even acknowledges, let alone under control*.  

given we are still doing behavioural nudges as a proxy for healthcare, and given how spectacularly that failed on the most basic and bare reading on how to apply that to a subject with ptsd, can we perhaps all agree that we are past the "if we keep our heads in the sand, she will disappear off the face of the earth" point?  

i'm literally only writing....nearly 1 million words... because no one is able to say enough for me to feel safe in my own home or when i am out of it, reasonably.  

and given the details i am clearly desperate to talk about but i am holding to disclose, i am being beyond reasonable, i feel.  

one might say "stupid", but that implies i don't know or haven't realised that that is the case.
