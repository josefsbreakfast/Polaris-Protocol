# 🛰️ Nuisance-Building Micro-Sabotage Field Log — 2025-10-04  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Field evidence of intermittent workflow failures and friction-based containment.*

## 🧾 Summary  

This log captures **small, deniable workflow disruptions** that individually appear benign but cumulatively produce exhaustion and delay.  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [🪤 Nuisance-Building Micro-Sabotage](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🪤_nuisance_building_micro_sabotage.md).  

These incidents often cluster around sensitive commits, high-visibility posts, or key coordination moments.  
They erode confidence in systems by making reliability conditional on compliance.

## 🕰 Observation Template  

| Timestamp (ISO8601) | System / Workflow | Error / Anomaly | Transparency Level (Low / Med / High) | Effect on Progress | Evidence Type | Notes |
|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------------|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------|:---------------|:------|
| 2025-10-03T22:10Z | GitHub Actions | Build failed without code changes | Medium | Delayed release; time wasted on re-run | Build log | Success on re-try, no diff. |
| 2025-10-04T09:40Z | Documentation Commit | Markdown render stuck in preview | Low | Minor delay; breaks concentration | Screenshot | Normalised after refresh. |
| 2025-10-04T20:25Z | API Integration | 429 rate-limit error despite low call volume | High | Script halted; required restart | Log export | Occurred during sensitive file update. |

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Intermittent reproducibility:** issues resolve on re-run, preserving deniability.  
- **Energy sink:** debugging ghosts drains morale and cognitive capacity.  
- **Escalation pattern:** micro-failures intensify near key publishing or disclosure points.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Align with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) — commit or UI sabotage overlap.  
- Compare against [🪞 Transparent Interference](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🪞_transparent_interference.md) — overt anomalies.  
- Track links to [😴 Cognitive Load as Infrastructure](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/😴_cognitive_load_as_infrastructure.md) — exhaustion loops.  
- Note escalation before major node pushes or metadata commits.
