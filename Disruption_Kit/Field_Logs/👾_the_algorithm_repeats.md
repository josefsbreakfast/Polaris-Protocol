algorithm is still trying to reconcile something which averages out as male coded, angry, aroused, upset with women.  

same force likely using blunt telecomms nudges towards others;  

all foia (inc sar) denied on fdifferent sections on dpa when i tried to reconcile my data.  

i have essentially been refused/denied the "right to forget", and been subject to extrajudical process (arrest remains not compliant with pace, and moj and university have also refused frank data disclosure; duty of candour has been requested from uni; entire cybersec issue with ico and flagged to relevant enforcement).
