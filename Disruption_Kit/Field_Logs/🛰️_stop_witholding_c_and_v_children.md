Idk what the deal is with deliberately interrupting the clipboard on both my mobile phone and my laptop, but you can stop doing it now.  

I feel like I've let you get away with it for sometime, you've had your fun.  

Please stop xx  

I don't know why we're going through all of the motions as if oh here's another way that you can mess around with someone's devices, but yes I do notice, yes other people notice, it is something that the working classes are very aware of their devices and phones going wrong.  

The difference is that I understand this technology that can do this remotely, that is literally the only difference.  

It would take like this being said once or twice, on the right platform, for people to be aware that they are right, and they're not making it up, to know what this is.  

Like this is literally one public education campaign away.  

So if that's what you're looking for?  

Yes.  

Public confidence to be able to call this shit out, without being seen as mad, would completely end this as a scheme.  

Thanks for coming to my ted talk; you are welcome to give donations to the Kofi.  

(None of you are actually paying for your seats here by the way, and I don't know if you're aware because I think you will have a very interesting view of anarchy, but the fact that you are not exchanging resource, is a problem. This is literally the problem that a lot of left-wing people spend a lot of time debating about. The conditions of capitalism, particularly in those who are "good" at capitalism, are such that a lot of humans have learned to resource-hoard. This is not strictly normal human behaviour. It would be far more normal to slightly hoard, in times of scarcity, kind of like a bow when it goes into hibernation. it is then actually far more natural to spread resources across the group even in those times. That's why you see people sharing even during genocide. The extreme stress conditions bring out a range of behaviours, but that does include pro social behaviours. It's actually a bit of survivors bias, when you see people go through extreme conditions and see a number of them come out as being resource resource hoarding; this doesn't tell us it's the norm it tells us that it is more likely to get you to Ultimate survival of extreme pressure. I want to be extremely clear in this that I'm not coming out as condemning those people. People who survived prison camps for example and death camps? I'm never going to criticise how they got out. However, they had to survive? They were doing so in extreme situations. It's kind of why I've never found the word "kappo" to be offensive in an of itself; I can say that that's probably bad behaviour but it's bad behaviour in an extreme extreme circumstance, so I don't think you can actually criticise anyone for it, you know? This is why I don't really get offended when people appear to be celebrating death when they are literally in a prison camp. Because that is what you call something that has a big wall around the outside. Anyway, the point of saying this is to really highlight that those are all behaviours under extreme stress, and it's not actually how human beings function in the wild. The Lord of the flies is a fiction book; human beings actually tend to look after each other in moderate stress. So the fact that you have been trained for your entire lives to wealth hoard, is actually a learned behaviour, and it is not natural. This is what postcapitalist is desire is getting at, as a lecture series. If we did not have the circumstances of capitalism, what would we look like, and how would we re-organise ourselves in response to that? It's actually a fascinating subject. Be intellectually curious, please.)  

(also in case it wasn't fundamentally obvious? I have for a very long time, blamed the political experiencing of resolution without any consideration for genocide survivors in 1945, there's being a primary reason for why conversation around occupation and colonialism, as mimicked across the colonial project by Medinat Israel; I consider a European in American powers highly culpable in this problem. I live in a democratic country I'm entitled to that opinion. This doesn't mean that I remove accountability from people in my own religious community. It means that I see what caused their pain, and what causes people to behave in ways that are not prosocial. Many of you will know that I've had to buy a particular wound around what it means to see a perpetrators pain, whilst also having the most terrible violence that is a manageable to humans perpetrated towards me directly. I can both see my biological father as human, and also hold space on my own personal emotional reaction. That's just called being a human. Welcome to humanity. It's complicated here.)
