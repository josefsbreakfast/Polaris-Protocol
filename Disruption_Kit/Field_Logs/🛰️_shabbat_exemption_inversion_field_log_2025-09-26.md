## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Asymmetric observance:** faith invoked for halting relief, not for halting harm.  
- **Routinisation:** repeated weekly cycle normalises structural delay.  
- **Containment function:** moral legitimacy used to quiet critique of obstruction.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Compare timestamps to operational logs showing ongoing activity.  
- Cross-reference with humanitarian coordination notices (OCHA, WHO, Red Crescent).  
- Analyse official religious justifications against *pikuach nefesh* citations.
