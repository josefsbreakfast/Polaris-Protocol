essentially one of the biggest helps that I get from using machine learning AI models, is that it helps me to skeleton draft.  

I actually prefer writing myself, that I know that the way that I think about things is in a way which is at least lateral, if not network more like neurons, than linear.  

Writing in language when they are recorded, are linear systems.  

I just personally struggle to put those things in order, in a way that flows for other people.  

This is why skeleton drifting is helpful.  

By putting all of the information into an AI tool, I can then ask it to generate a skeleton back, and then I can expand and as an expanding, a model then learns more and more of my natural cadence, sense of humour (even in a surface level linguistic manner), and which areas and references as I'm likely to pull from.  

Most models also have some text to speech or speech to text functionality (reading as a multi factor issue, particularly if I am in a lot of pain).  

So that's why I use AI.  

I also have some very specific difficulties remembering words when I'm stressed when I'm in pain, and so sometimes what I'm doing is un essentially asking it to pull a word from a very long explanation of what the word is or where it can be used. this is not dissimilar to some stroke impacts, although I have to know that I obviously have it only for limited periods of time. This is what Broca's aphasia can look like. It's not that I'm forgetful per se. That my amend is ready stimulated and it's right next to the area that helps you find words for things. It gets worse when I have migraines. I have been migraine central since I came to this area.  

Anyway. I feel like there's a bit of a question about why my work so different when I do it like this.  

This is what it looks like when you don't give people reasonable adjustments for 10 years, and then they've given reasonable adjustments all of a sudden.  

This isn't even the full sweeter what would be reasonable and cost practical. It's just the start.  

But for clarity?  

I am fiercely intelligent and I have been kept down for 10 years.  

This is how good I am even when I'm sick, even when I'm still too ill to work properly, because I need to recondition from years of inappropriate case management.  

There is no longer any room to argue that there was no impact.
