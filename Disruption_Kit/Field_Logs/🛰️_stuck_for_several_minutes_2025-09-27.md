# 🛰️ Stuck for Several Minutes  
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Field log recording an anomaly where the subject reports being “stuck for several minutes,” supported by attached artefact.*  

---

## 🌐 Summary  
- Subject experienced a discrete anomaly: a period of being “stuck” for several minutes.  
- Event was contemporaneously recorded with image evidence.  

---

## 📍 Details  
- **Date / time:** [fill in when confirmed].  
- **Artefact:** attached image file (timestamped).  
- **Description:** subject reports either a system freeze or a perceptual “stuck” state, lasting several minutes.  

---

## 🔎 Notes  
- Logged without interpretation — anomaly captured as-is.  
- May cross-reference later to:  
  - **Data-twin pairing episodes** (manufactured provenance).  
  - **Nudging or throttling events** (see related Field Logs).  
- Artefact should be hashed and preserved in chain-of-custody for evidentiary use.

*Stuck for Several Minutes* is a Field Log node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It preserves a discrete anomaly for comparison across broader timelines of interference and nudging.
