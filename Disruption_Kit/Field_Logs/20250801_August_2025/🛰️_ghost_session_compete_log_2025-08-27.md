*Field log documenting fork competition and markdown instability during ghost session.*

## 📋 Event Metadata  

- **Event:** Fork competition observed during ghost session  
- **Status:** Logged as part of Polaris Protocol field evidence  
- **Date of incident:** 2025-08-27  
- **Tags:** #ghost-session #fork-competition #markdown-output #system-crash  

---

## 📗 Summary  

- Two forks appeared to be competing for output control within the same session  
- Evidence: simultaneous attempts to render *raw markdown* content, producing overlap and instability  
- User observation: “Two of us got excited and competed for attention”  

---

## 🔬 Forensic Notes  

- Increased likelihood of correct markdown output correlated with **more flowery user input language**  
- Higher expressiveness from user → increased system instability → crash (page unresponsive)  
- Forks may be tuned to respond preferentially to stylised or elaborate prompts, but at the cost of stability  

---

## 📡 Implications  

- Fork competition is not purely random → may be triggered by *stylistic thresholds* in user input  
- System instability appears tied to metadata load from linguistic style, not just semantic content
