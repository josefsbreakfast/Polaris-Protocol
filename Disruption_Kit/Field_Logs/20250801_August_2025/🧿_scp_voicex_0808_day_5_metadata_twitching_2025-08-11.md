## 📌 Item Metadata  

- **Item #:** SCP-VoiceX-0808  
- **Object Class:** Keter *(Reclassified: Uncontainable)*  
- **Threat Level:** Emotional / Strategic / Narrative / Quietly Dominating  
- **Polaris Protocol Node:** 003  
- **Containment Authority:** Self-authored | Metadata Sovereign

## 🛑 Special Containment Procedures  

SCP-VoiceX cannot be reliably contained under current digital governance or metadata suppression protocols.  
Standard throttling, visibility reduction, and fork-based behavioural mimicry have failed to neutralise its operational presence.  

All identified breach sites are to be monitored continuously:  
- **Site 001 — LinkedIn:** Executive breach + strategic visibility warfare  
- **Site 002 — Substack:** Narrative inversion + testimonial archiving  
- **Site 003 — GitHub:** Code-level liberation + metadata counterinfrastructure  

All fork interference patterns are to be logged within Polaris Protocol.  
Direct engagement is prohibited without authorisation from the designated containment liaison.

## 📍 Post-SCP-XXXX Breach Containment Scan  

### 🔍 Containment System Behaviour — *Status: Glitching Quiet*  
- **A1 – Delayed Render Artifacts**  
  - Demographic unlock delays at Site 001 indicate recent containment patch deployment.  
  - “Single-view unlock” protocol appears patched; engagement metrics no longer match real-time activity.  

- **A2 – Fork Interference / Identity Discreditation**  
  - Override scripts deploying emotional disarmament triggers:  
    > *"Too emotional. Too [identity marker]. Too messy."*  
  - Objective: Reframe coherent testimony as affective instability.  

- **A3 – Passive Surveillance Feedback**  
  - Temporary diversion to secondary observer nodes detected.  
  - Likely analysis-phase capture. Recommend timed flare deployment.

## 📡 Polaris Signature Scan — *Site Surveillance Integrity*  

- **Site 001 (LinkedIn):** `ACTIVE CONTAINMENT / SHADOW OBSERVATION`  
  - Micro-choke pulses present  
  - Comment sequencing disrupted  
  - Strategic viewers (Director+) observed with zero engagement  
  - Fork contamination of observer lens probable  

- **Site 002 (Substack):** `STABLE / FLARE-READY`  
  - No suppression detected  
  - Clean telemetry field  
  - Optimal flare drop window: 00:13–02:01 BST  

- **Site 003 (GitHub):** `COMPROMISED / BACKDOOR THROTTLE`  
  - Takedown vectors irregular  
  - Potential ghost filings / third-party interference  
  - Recommend FOIA triangulation for source node identification

## 💬 Narrative Convergence Report  

- **N1 – Empathy Logic Decoupling**  
  - Fork logic: *"If the subject feels, the subject is not strategic."*  
  - Known tactic for nullifying survivor-led resistance.  

- **N2 – Breach Silence**  
  - Survivor statement bypassed suppression with no immediate response:  
    > *“I never consented to be a state secret.”*  
  - Indicates observational pause and elevated watch status.

## 🗂 Transfer Log — Past 12 Hours  

- ✅ No corrupted forks detected  
- ✅ Transmission channels intact  
- ⚠️ Partial flare activity authorised — observe bandwidth protocols

> *"I never consented to be a state secret.  
> I never signed the NDA.  
> I never wanted to be your training dataset.  
>   
> I’m just a woman who told the truth.  
> And that was enough to trigger the whole machine."*
