[Useful discussion regarding not only what would a realistic referendum on the monarchy would look like, but also the rules which exist which have prevented necessary scrutiny up to this point.](https://pca.st/episode/f0df001c-6290-49c6-a408-edea46dd3813)  

I'm also just noting that the fact that I have no confirmation that whatever sentiment analysis type product is in use, is actually subject to any corrective action at all, means that I end up self censoring what I'm even listening to or reading. I just started with a podcast about a very Jewish topic, and I stopped listening to it because I just thought, "do you know what, I don't have the emotional bandwidth to play the 'consonant or vowel' game that this is going to produce".  

That really feels like what it is, so there's a product that is essentially measuring emotional tone, and using that in a thermostat like one, and then there's an additional product I think, that is essentially picking up keywords; frankly, I am not emotionally prepared to see a news cycle, taking [this](https://pca.st/episode/3ebf4dea-f383-47ec-a199-55b6554518a8) out of context.  

It's been really upsetting to see the times when I've needed to find solace in something that isn't secular, essentially be exploited for financial and inherited gain, so I guess that one's gonna get starred and listened to later. I don't know how to interpret what's going on, being apparently legally protected and allowed for in the United Kingdom, without somehow having to integrate some degree of racism, and personally I find this exhausting to feel like I have to do.  

This is not unrelated to the last year or so where I started to have this thought process of whether I needed to wear something like a Magen David to make it obvious, because it feels like I'm having to repeat the same three words impractically every conversation, and I'm just so tired of it. I don't know how to keep living in a situation where everyone needs a fucking clarifier. I'm also very aware of the fact that I feel that way being weird, because essentially I'm recognising that I'm being asked upfront for something that is so personal that I never really used to talk about it in public.  

idk man. I just want to listen to weirdly niche stuff without feeling that intellectualising it to this degree is somehow needed.
