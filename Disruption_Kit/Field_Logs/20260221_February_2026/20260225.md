[Useful discussion regarding not only what would a realistic referendum on the monarchy would look like, but also the rules which exist which have prevented necessary scrutiny up to this point.](https://pca.st/episode/f0df001c-6290-49c6-a408-edea46dd3813)  

I'm also just noting that the fact that I have no confirmation that whatever sentiment analysis type product is in use, is actually subject to any corrective action at all, means that I end up self censoring what I'm even listening to or reading. I just started with a podcast about a very Jewish topic, and I stopped listening to it because I just thought, "do you know what, I don't have the emotional bandwidth to play the 'consonant or vowel' game that this is going to produce".  

That really feels like what it is, so there's a product that is essentially measuring emotional tone, and using that in a thermostat like one, and then there's an additional product I think, that is essentially picking up keywords; frankly, I am not emotionally prepared to see newsroom "what's trending" output, taking [this](https://pca.st/episode/3ebf4dea-f383-47ec-a199-55b6554518a8) out of context.  

It's been really upsetting to see the times when I've needed to find solace in something that isn't secular, essentially be exploited for financial and inherited gain, so I guess that one's gonna get starred and listened to later. I don't know how to interpret what's going on, being apparently legally protected and allowed for in the United Kingdom, without somehow having to integrate some degree of racism, and personally I find this exhausting to feel like I have to do.  

This is not unrelated to the last year or so where I started to have this thought process of whether I needed to wear something like a Magen David to make it obvious, because it feels like I'm having to repeat the same three words impractically every conversation, and I'm just so tired of it. I don't know how to keep living in a situation where everyone needs a fucking clarifier. I'm also very aware of the fact that I feel that way being weird, because essentially I'm recognising that I'm being asked upfront for something that is so personal that I never really used to talk about it in public.  

idk man. I just want to listen to weirdly niche stuff without feeling that intellectualising it to this degree is somehow needed.  

I need to kick some more emails back to defence companies that I've given odd responses or no response at all, and probably kick something back to the MOD regarding this week, but it is very frustrating to me that I'm essentially arguing with brick walls when it's supposed to be my identifiable data, that I'm not even sure why some of them even have. It feels like it's perfectly legal to just steal someone's identity, and do what you want with it. Realistically, it takes months to be able to do anything about, you can be stonewalled from loads of different places, the ICO operates on a good faith basis (which has an obvious weakness), and the cost of going to court to get an order for discovery can still essentially not be honoured (so any process is going to cost money, and presumably most of us are only going to notice once there is already impact). It just feels like a system where you can use an abuse people however you want, when it comes to how the law actually functions in practice.  


The worst thing about that is that a lot of the markers that make my data interesting are things that do appear on lots of people's data, and century indicates some degree of pre-existing vulnerability, so it really does feel like we're just kicking people when they're down.

[Regarding this "riots" and "food shortages" business](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5xXvad/), has anyone actually negotiated with the food suppliers regarding the supply chain issue if this is what it is?  

I've seen a couple of social media posts with empty shelves, but they appear to be in really select supermarkets and shops, and I appreciate that capitalism is a supply and demand thing, but we also have to recognise that some degree food is an infrastructure issue.  

It's very difficult to understand whether or not this is actually a problem beyond supermarket planning in a capital society, because any further field and well looking at global supply chains, all of the conflicts which are currently active, any use of airspace of shipping or rail that has been diverted, and any of the current genocides happening. These are the things that drive food shortages. Oh, except this one other really obvious one, and it's white chocolate is in security boxes. But the last time I checked, enough politicians were so sewn up with oil and gas money, that it was essentially impossible to have a conversation about climate change and systems resilience around that, seeing as there are so many heads in the sand.  

[Two minutes on Google confirms that this is essentially all around one paper, and it's about the potential not an active current emergency.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/food-insecurity-uk-climate-change-b2925847.html)  

None of this is going to actually improve if we don't have breathing space to think through anything, and arguably if we're looking at why we don't have resilience as a country, we can look at the last 20 to 40 years, were any resilience and any amount of "give" in the system was stripped away.
