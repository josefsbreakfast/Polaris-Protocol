[Useful discussion regarding not only what would a realistic referendum on the monarchy would look like, but also the rules which exist which have prevented necessary scrutiny up to this point.](https://pca.st/episode/f0df001c-6290-49c6-a408-edea46dd3813)  

I'm also just noting that the fact that I have no confirmation that whatever sentiment analysis type product is in use, is actually subject to any corrective action at all, means that I end up self censoring what I'm even listening to or reading. I just started with a podcast about a very Jewish topic, and I stopped listening to it because I just thought, "do you know what, I don't have the emotional bandwidth to play the 'consonant or vowel' game that this is going to produce".  

That really feels like what it is, so there's a product that is essentially measuring emotional tone, and using that in a thermostat like one, and then there's an additional product I think, that is essentially picking up keywords; frankly, I am not emotionally prepared to see newsroom "what's trending" output, taking [this](https://pca.st/episode/3ebf4dea-f383-47ec-a199-55b6554518a8) out of context.  

It's been really upsetting to see the times when I've needed to find solace in something that isn't secular, essentially be exploited for financial and inherited gain, so I guess that one's gonna get starred and listened to later. I don't know how to interpret what's going on, being apparently legally protected and allowed for in the United Kingdom, without somehow having to integrate some degree of racism, and personally I find this exhausting to feel like I have to do.  

This is not unrelated to the last year or so where I started to have this thought process of whether I needed to wear something like a Magen David to make it obvious, because it feels like I'm having to repeat the same three words impractically every conversation, and I'm just so tired of it. I don't know how to keep living in a situation where everyone needs a fucking clarifier. I'm also very aware of the fact that I feel that way being weird, because essentially I'm recognising that I'm being asked upfront for something that is so personal that I never really used to talk about it in public.  

idk man. I just want to listen to weirdly niche stuff without feeling that intellectualising it to this degree is somehow needed.  

I need to kick some more emails back to defence companies that I've given odd responses or no response at all, and probably kick something back to the MOD regarding this week, but it is very frustrating to me that I'm essentially arguing with brick walls when it's supposed to be my identifiable data, that I'm not even sure why some of them even have. It feels like it's perfectly legal to just steal someone's identity, and do what you want with it. Realistically, it takes months to be able to do anything about, you can be stonewalled from loads of different places, the ICO operates on a good faith basis (which has an obvious weakness), and the cost of going to court to get an order for discovery can still essentially not be honoured (so any process is going to cost money, and presumably most of us are only going to notice once there is already impact). It just feels like a system where you can use an abuse people however you want, when it comes to how the law actually functions in practice.  


The worst thing about that is that a lot of the markers that make my data interesting are things that do appear on lots of people's data, and century indicates some degree of pre-existing vulnerability, so it really does feel like we're just kicking people when they're down.

[Regarding this "riots" and "food shortages" business](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5xXvad/), has anyone actually negotiated with the food suppliers regarding the supply chain issue if this is what it is?  

I've seen a couple of social media posts with empty shelves, but they appear to be in really select supermarkets and shops, and I appreciate that capitalism is a supply and demand thing, but we also have to recognise that some degree food is an infrastructure issue.  

It's very difficult to understand whether or not this is actually a problem beyond supermarket planning in a capital society, because any further field and well looking at global supply chains, all of the conflicts which are currently active, any use of airspace of shipping or rail that has been diverted, and any of the current genocides happening. These are the things that drive food shortages. Oh, except this one other really obvious one, and it's white chocolate is in security boxes. But the last time I checked, enough politicians were so sewn up with oil and gas money, that it was essentially impossible to have a conversation about climate change and systems resilience around that, seeing as there are so many heads in the sand.  

[Two minutes on Google confirms that this is essentially all around one paper, and it's about the potential not an active current emergency.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/food-insecurity-uk-climate-change-b2925847.html)  

None of this is going to actually improve if we don't have breathing space to think through anything, and arguably if we're looking at why we don't have resilience as a country, we can look at the last 20 to 40 years, were any resilience and any amount of "give" in the system was stripped away.  

[Here is an older article showing that this has been an active issue for some time.](https://news.sky.com/story/uk-criminally-unprepared-to-feed-itself-in-crisis-our-diets-may-have-to-change-13415199)  

One of the current cabinet minister is used to be one of the best subcommittee chairs, specifically in business and trade, and was quite rare and being able to hold a strong accountability checking to the witnesses giving evidence of subcommittee level. This included the sea suite of very large companies, including international ones, and I believe that there was a period where that was work done on the supermarket supply chain.  

It's really strange that so many news highlights have run with this story from Sustainability, as if this is a wild departure from a real reality that we've been living with for some years now.  

It reminds me a lot of that Australian TV presenter stood in front of the toilet paper rolls, and then we were inundated with rules about how many bog rolls you could buy for months because people panicked.  

Remember how much it was selling for on eBay? Crazy times.  

i'm just curious what has tapped the scales on that, such that it's become something which actually quite a lot of news agents are running as if it's an emergent issue within the last 72 hours.

[Thank G-d someone said this on TV.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5xvHhm/)  

The idea of discounting the potential for any harm to these two women when they were children, even though we don't have information either way, is really harmful to any survivors ever abuse. I'm glad somebody's actually said this using a mainstream-enough forum where this might start becoming part of the wider conversation. there was some ready strange stories that look like briefing from the Household (rather than from the people who are in that family as individuals, like we all have families), which appeared to try and scapegoat them within their generation so that it preserved other figures in that generation, which just seemed really weird. We are in a world which is post-MeToo, so while there is undoubtably going to be some PR work being done, there is a need to balance trauma informed practice here. They should always have been a need to balance trauma informed work, but this is becoming less acceptable to the public, and there is a very vocal part of social media that will be, and has been, very hot on the heels of those stories to call out that particular problem. we are living in a world where people understand complex relational dynamics, certainly within a younger audience, and this is part of why sometimes the PR reads as being out of touch, particularly with that generation.  

To give that generation it's due, this is a healthier psychological place to be in, even though it feels difficult at the time, it does tend to produce a more effective resolution of the narratives in our own heads, and contributes to more stable ongoing narrative.  

The stories we tell, either to ourselves or two others, or all very powerful; we need look no further than the placebo effect being more effective than doing nothing at all, and often sometimes only marginally less effective than drugs that we still commonly use due to their potential, to understand that our brains and our nervous systems are incredibly powerful, often without us even trying. The idea that this all gets clustered under crisis management, and often doesn't get resolved on a longer term, does impact everyone who is exposed to it, and as uncomfortable as we may be about how powerful that it is, it is something that we need to reckon with, especially as we go forward in the age of information being such a large factor in modern warfare. No one needs bombs, if you have the right words, and in the wrong hands or without appropriate defence, they can do many very harmful things, even simply by their absence, as well as their presence.

My professional analytics away from this, would suggest that I'm potentially being viewed in a small group chat, and possibly there is some reassessment of the seriousness of anything that I might have said in the past, potentially indicating that information is in the present.  

I would really, really appreciate some form via update or just confirmation that whatever the SLAPP was, is no longer there. You're making it look like it was a superinjunction at this point, which one would have to say would sound absolutely ridiculous.  

It's really painful in the context of why I've been reporting these problems, which to be honest I don't even want to have to say out loud to dictate. See previous.  

I'm not unaware that there was probably a very interesting story put around about me, and that this might have significantly influence people who were in the position of delivering services or answering legal requests. I just really would like the silence to end, so I can continue with the rest of the things that I need to do in order to sort out the rest of the problems with my digital identity.  

It might also be worth noting that I frequently get things that come up more raggedy for me than for someone else using the Internet of my demographics, that strongly suggest that there is either a revenge porn or AI porn element, including the other worse bit, and so I just really want to be put out of my misery at this point. I am pretty desperate to be at least reassuringly informed that the issue was under control, even if it's not fully resolved at this point. I just want to be able to feel safe enough to sleep when it's dark outside.

These are two of the biggest forces of antifascism currently, so show some fucking respect.  

Things are cooking up in the mainstream media as well, and it's all very exciting; we can start to see the picking a part of the underlying mechanisms of policy again, even worse sometimes it's quite contentious to do so, so we are getting somewhere.

By the way, I do know why we're all supposed to be arguing about disability now, because a number of conservative news outlets putting pictures out of the late scientist with children who are being trafficked and by definition in the photos sexually exploited, including by Jeffrey Epstein, and expecting us to action in particular way that removes any responsibility simply because he was a disabled person.  

This is interesting because it's suggests that at least part of the news media are aware of a number of controllers and bots on the Internet and how they function, and specifically how they can be manipulated for the semantics.  

This does ask some serious questions of a number of owners and executives in the main stream impress, for what the fuck they knew about Jeffrey Epstein, and why they're so fucking uncomfortable with us talking about it.  

I thought you were pro us getting involved in doing something about grooming gangs, or is it literally only if we avoid talking about the white ones?
