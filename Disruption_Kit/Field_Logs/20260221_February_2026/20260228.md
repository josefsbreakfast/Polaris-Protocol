[Regarding this conversation about autonomous military decisions with AI...](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRarvhjn/)  

I really don't feel that some people in what might be called the centre or the moderate part of politics, in the west, really understand what Mr Hegseth was prepared to commit to on paper in what is published and called a "book". If you're finding it difficult to imagine that his judgement may not be hugely motivated by the international rule based order or our shared moral norms or international humanitarian law, then I do recommend looking at precisely what he is prepared to say and commit to on paper, because he is not hiding who he is, or what he believes.
