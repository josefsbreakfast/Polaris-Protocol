I might quibble about the minutae, but for broad brushes, I think this is the best take that I've seen so far.

[Regarding this conversation about autonomous military decisions with AI...](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRarvhjn/)  

I really don't feel that some people in what might be called the centre or the moderate part of politics, in the west, really understand what Mr Hegseth was prepared to commit to on paper in what is published and called a "book". If you're finding it difficult to imagine that his judgement may not be hugely motivated by the international rule based order or our shared moral norms or international humanitarian law, then I do recommend looking at precisely what he is prepared to say and commit to on paper, because he is not hiding who he is, or what he believes.

Just admit that it sucked.  

just admit that other rich man decided that you were not worth helping.  

You wonder why I can see through you all, it's because I grew up in the fucking north; we are all like this, because admitting to ourselves that a small group of men in the South decided it was more important to make them in their friends even richer, and that we were worthy collateral, it's hard. So we decide instead to frame us all as being survivors of the true experience of what it is to be human, rather than just admit that it sucked. 

This is the real difference between someone who votes right and votes left, in the pleb classes. The only difference is how you decide to deal with the outcome of failures of governance. Neither is necessarily right or wrong morally, but one is going to indulge an illusion that survival is about being inherentky strong, and one is probably more in line with actually getting something done, however heavily flawed that particular "getting something done" is.

That was a reason that Richmond decided to put breweries in contracts with working men's clubs. They encouraged it because it made us choose the opium of the masses, rather than choose what we were originally doing in working men's clubs, which was reading and organising.

Alcohol was very much part of making water safe to drink in the United Kingdom, but we also can't ignore how many times it has been used as a deliberate tool to quash working class uprising.  

This is why you don't trust anyone who wants to grab a two child benefit cap, and move the savings onto beer; it's very on the nose.  

And while I personally don't really go in for the painting of statues, some of you need to work out what Churchill was doing about working class uprising before he became Prime Minister during World War II. He faced us down with guns. we can have our favourites, and we can have times where we use figures as being symbols of our resistance to foreign invasion during that war, but we also need to be appreciate the Churchill was doing a lot of shit before and after, that wasn't exactly working class friendly. And yes, he was horrifically racist, and yes, even after World War II was a terrible peace time Prime Minister.  

That doesn't mean you have to abandon the pride of the homefront, but it doesn't mean you need to celebrate him and every single way for every single thing that he did, either. It's okay that your favourite also did some really fucked up shit, and if you would rather have a "cleaner" favourite, there are plenty and this is essentially what Wikipedia offers the masses. That's why Wikipedia was so heavily targeted during a very recent information war; all of the Jewish historical content on that has been altered significantly in the last three years. That's how powerful knowledge is.
