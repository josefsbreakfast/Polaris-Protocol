I might quibble about the minutae, but for broad brushes, I think this is the best take that I've seen so far.

[Regarding this conversation about autonomous military decisions with AI...](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRarvhjn/)  

I really don't feel that some people in what might be called the centre or the moderate part of politics, in the west, really understand what Mr Hegseth was prepared to commit to on paper in what is published and called a "book". If you're finding it difficult to imagine that his judgement may not be hugely motivated by the international rule based order or our shared moral norms or international humanitarian law, then I do recommend looking at precisely what he is prepared to say and commit to on paper, because he is not hiding who he is, or what he believes.

Just admit that it sucked.  

just admit that other rich man decided that you were not worth helping.  

You wonder why I can see through you all, it's because I grew up in the fucking north; we are all like this, because admitting to ourselves that a small group of men in the South decided it was more important to make them in their friends even richer, and that we were worthy collateral, it's hard. So we decide instead to frame us all as being survivors of the true experience of what it is to be human, rather than just admit that it sucked. 

This is the real difference between someone who votes right and votes left, in the pleb classes. The only difference is how you decide to deal with the outcome of failures of governance. Neither is necessarily right or wrong morally, but one is going to indulge an illusion that survival is about being inherentky strong, and one is probably more in line with actually getting something done, however heavily flawed that particular "getting something done" is.

That was a reason that Richmond decided to put breweries in contracts with working men's clubs. They encouraged it because it made us choose the opium of the masses, rather than choose what we were originally doing in working men's clubs, which was reading and organising.
