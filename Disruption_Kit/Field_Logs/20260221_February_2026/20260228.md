I might quibble about the minutae, but for broad brushes, I think this is the best take that I've seen so far.

[Regarding this conversation about autonomous military decisions with AI...](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRarvhjn/)  

I really don't feel that some people in what might be called the centre or the moderate part of politics, in the west, really understand what Mr Hegseth was prepared to commit to on paper in what is published and called a "book". If you're finding it difficult to imagine that his judgement may not be hugely motivated by the international rule based order or our shared moral norms or international humanitarian law, then I do recommend looking at precisely what he is prepared to say and commit to on paper, because he is not hiding who he is, or what he believes.

[Real live footage from every neolib think tag tonight, after the greens won. "When *I* was young, we kept the lead in the pain like real men!"](https://youtu.be/7Lb-2VaJYPw?si=2-CwidYEXWaTkCei)  

Just admit that it sucked.  

just admit that other rich man decided that you were not worth helping.  

You wonder why I can see through you all, it's because I grew up in the fucking north; we are all like this, because admitting to ourselves that a small group of men in the South decided it was more important to make them in their friends even richer, and that we were worthy collateral, it's hard. So we decide instead to frame us all as being survivors of the true experience of what it is to be human, rather than just admit that it sucked. 

This is the real difference between someone who votes right and votes left, in the pleb classes. The only difference is how you decide to deal with the outcome of failures of governance. Neither is necessarily right or wrong morally, but one is going to indulge an illusion that survival is about being inherentky strong, and one is probably more in line with actually getting something done, however heavily flawed that particular "getting something done" is.

That was a reason that rich men decided to put breweries in contracts with working men's clubs. They encouraged it because it made us choose the opium of the masses, rather than choose what we were originally doing in working men's clubs, which was reading and organising.  

(Due to the crossover of prohibition in the US in particular, this is also why worker's songs, such as those by the IWW, bare a striking similarity in tune to Salvation Army songs.)  

["As soon as this pub closes, the revolution starts... ... ...I think I'm going be sick."](https://youtu.be/B96qKs4-EI8?si=xWlJXGycTTQZf6vn)  

Alcohol was very much part of making water safe to drink in the United Kingdom, but we also can't ignore how many times it has been used as a deliberate tool to quash working class uprising.  

This is why you don't trust anyone who wants to grab a two child benefit cap, and move the savings onto beer; it's very on the nose.  

And while I personally don't really go in for the painting of statues, some of you need to work out what Churchill was doing about working class uprising before he became Prime Minister during World War II. He faced us down with guns. we can have our favourites, and we can have times where we use figures as being symbols of our resistance to foreign invasion during that war, but we also need to be appreciate the Churchill was doing a lot of shit before and after, that wasn't exactly working class friendly. And yes, he was horrifically racist, and yes, even after World War II was a terrible peace time Prime Minister.  

That doesn't mean you have to abandon the pride of the homefront, but it doesn't mean you need to celebrate him and every single way for every single thing that he did, either. It's okay that your favourite also did some really fucked up shit, and if you would rather have a "cleaner" favourite, there are plenty and this is essentially what Wikipedia offers the masses. That's why Wikipedia was so heavily targeted during a very recent information war; all of the Jewish historical content on that has been altered significantly in the last three years. That's how powerful knowledge is. Large sections of Holocaust history were altered, because they look too much like resistance; there wasn't just one regime that benefited from those alterations. A lot of what resistance to a specific fascist dictatorship looks like, was erased or altered.  

This is why that list from the US Navy of what the administration forcibly took out of their libraries, has been kept by so many people who believe in resisting those kind of regiemes - the regime was telling us exactly what they were scared of us knowing. when you put identity politics and however you conceive it to one side, that list is essentially a list of books that show you how to build solidarity across the working class. You may not think books about black trans experience are that, but that is what they are, enough that a regime was terrified of those books and felt the need to demonise them and remove them from circulation, as far as they had the power to do so.  

Everything gets sexier once you suppress it.

In other news, my preferred version of the mantra (*Om Kreem Kali Kaliyhe Namaha*) was deindexed, but I found it again from an old WhatsApp conversation. Bwahahahahahaha. This is how petty The Men™️ are. And how much they are prepared to coopt any religious belief when it suits them, but not when it actually helps anyone. The fact that is in thousands of years effusion of beliefs and philosophy, and so they choose to misinterpret Hinduism as being in somehow conflict with Abrahamic belief, is an interesting choice. It shouldn't exactly be a mystery why sometimes I do not feel safe even to use masculine terms towards a concept of United divinity, and sometimes I need to see that through an entirely maternal lens, in order to feel it one with it. These are not prosocial men.  

I don't make any bones about the fact that both Buddhism and Hinduism have been able to deepen my religion as someone who ascribes to an Abrahamic religion, much as folk magic has able to deepen my religious practice; none of this is evidence of false idolatry, but instead allows me to get around the fact that I've been deeply harmed by the presence and expression of masculinity in this world. if it wasn't being able to access G-d through plurality, I would just simply not be religious. Why would I be, when child rape exists? It is only as a result of being able to access priority within a democracy that I have been able to deepen that sense of spiritual achievement with these larger philosophical concepts.  

But a handful of coked-up men are unimaginative enough and just hate women enough, that they need to put forward only one way in order to see the world, so why not. 🤦‍♀️  

Speaking of the opium of the masses, they were literally do anything possible to divorce you from a sense of real depth of religiousity; religion is only a useful tool to them, if it advances imperial control. anything which potentially interrupts that control, is what is claimed to be blasphemous.  

I also imagine that the expression of pure feminine anger, in protection of children as a whole, and in protection of the wider world, such that the only thing that can disturb it is mask in humility demonstrating how it must have boundary, is also just a little bit too much for these guys.  

Strong men are able to take the lead of pretending to be corpses in front of women losing their shit. Weak men deindex meditation tools.  

Even worse for them, this is an expression of righteous feminine anger which arises from otherwise tranquil feminine source - it's their worst nightmare.

[Trump hasn't decided what to do about Iran, because his regime has not decided what to do about Iran, which means that they are not confident they know exactly what the fuck they're doing.](https://youtu.be/0fpfWnP197g?si=eTu_PvYytxjQdy1y)  

Because they don't know what the fuck they're doing, they keep going with people who don't know anything about the region. I don't know anything about what's going on, and they have no interest in the actual People of Iran, they just really don't want to release the Epstein files, and they really don't want to talk about why there hasn't been thorough investigation, and they lost their tariff case in a very conservative Supreme Court, and ICE is playing out extremely badly, which is why it's trying to become increasingly brutal at a central level, which are all signs that the regime is in crisis.  

They don't know what to do because they genuinely fear that they might push people a bit too far on this, and they are terrified of what might happen if they lose executive power.  

They know that the world is not behind them like it used to be, and they know that NATO is fed up.  

The regime is terrified. That's why it doesn't know whether or not it should bomb another country.  

Keeping them scared, is not only good domestic politics, but it is also good international politics.  

The age of monsters needs to come to an end; the new era is ready to be birthed. Both psychopomps and midwives are needed for the resistance to complete its goals (primarily not allowing this bunch of losers have this much power; they clearly can't handle it).
