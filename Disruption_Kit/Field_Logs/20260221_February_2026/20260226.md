[I, too, have some questions for the RAF, regarding trafficking, and provisions for safeguarding underage females.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5tsG9L/)  

Who the hell did you give/not check access of my Welbeck data to?  

Anyone who knew, the MOD as a whole stop speaking to me during the subject access request process, when I confirmed that the data should be handled under the Children's Act, and that I was denied any meaningful ability to consent to its current use. I don't know if this means they've identified a problem that they're actually doing something about, or if this means that they are just trying to make the problem go away.  

I would suggest at this point it's quite difficult to make a problem go go away. I would like to see some of this and it's over potentially in the humble address request, because what on earth has been done with it?  

I have never been a Crown Servant, it should not be protected under "national security" unless you've done something particularly unhinged with it, and it is not unrelated of data from a Crown Court trial that has gone missing.  

I'm finding it very difficult to understand why it appears the law applies to everyone else except from me; what the fuck did anyone do with my fucking data, and why have I needed to clarify my nationality to everyone, and why has the FCDO returned no record of any embassy use of any of my data?  

(To be fair, I think tzippy does pull in a "terrorist" ticket on basically anyone Jewish who says anything that she doesn't like outside her embassy, which in the state of Israel under the mandate laws, is technically a correct definition of the word terrorist _according to her government only **and should not be applied within the UK**_.)  

there is a cold water of people who have been defending your democracy here, consistently, for three years, against misuse of these terms; it is political people who have been distorting the capacity for this country to see that none of these laws should be applied as if the UK were in wartime, because no such declaration has been made to the parliament of the United Kingdom, yet in many cases the laws regarding this are being applied as if we are currently within a wartime period. I ask the honourable readership to please wake up if you have not already. you need to stop looking at this as I like right or left, aren't you, because the people who are spearheading the current anti-democratic attempt, are not. They are just looking at it as territorial control, which to be fair is a lot more intelligent than "which side of a specific building does this person sit on". Nor have they all come with one nationality, nor are they all particularly motivated by the same thing, other than a very specific type of governance being in situ, which requires democracy to be undermined. Some of them are just here for the bank.  

This is why I find the term "asset" more helpful. You need to look beyond what was possible only with traditional intelligence and traditional borders, and look at what is possible now that you have the digital infrastructure that you have.  

Likud might be aligned, but it doesn't represent the whole picture necessarily, nor does the territory they operate in, represent the entire picture. It's very deregulated though, and it's very opportunistic, politically. Given how close it is to being bankrupt at given time recently, you have to anticipate that perhaps there will be more than just the traditional allies assisting such an entity. If you genuinely believed that the State of Israel was absolutely necessary for our survival, why would you let it fall by maintaining only loyal support to the West, if they couldn't bankroll you? The answer is: you wouldn't let it fall on those terms. You would reassess alliances accordingly.  

Especially if you felt the West had been infiltrated by the "woke leftist extremists". Doesn't that originate as Russian political speech, anyway? As in PutinProm speech?  

Oh wait, I forgot, you can't possibly be both right wing and infiltrated by Russia, according to the prevent guidelines in training. My bad. Tell your little tsarina bear friend I said hi. I'll stay here defending our island. It's cool.

[The rest that have been made, from holding signs up, even though the prescription has been found to be unlawful, are still going ahead.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5tEwey/) but we can't call a murder at a mosque with armed men, in the same area as a similar attack at a synagogue that was called terrorism, terrorism?  

MI5, The Home Office, prevent, you guys need to sit down and put your heads together, because something is not adding up in this.  

just please make it make any sense. Just any sense at all.  

this is also why it's not possible in this country to have a synagogue which is not actively taking aside on British foreign policy, in line with what Britain is currently putting forward as it's foreign policy, because the synagogue would lose its public protection, but remain at high risk. I'm not meaning to take away from the horrible murder of a young Muslim man. I'm trying to show how ridiculous these rules are, and how they act actively constrain minority religions in this country.  

Every religion that is not Christian, is still constrained by needing to prove that it is not some sort of hot house for terrorists; when that is the case, how can we call ourselves a democracy? The point of democracy is to have plurality. Why do we have to be on side with everything that the British government wants to do in the foreign office, just to get adequate protection from the violent bigots that we apparently cannot get rid of?  

If you want to even it out, I'm going to need to see some Anglican bishops get frisked.

[Six days? Were they moving him out? Was there anything left?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5n18tf/) 🤣🤣  

I guess it's not the type of neighbourhood where you can count on a neighbour to "borrow the telly" from round the back, before they come in.

I think part of the reason why I'm remembering the synagogue attack so vividly, it's because it was just after the first of Epstein files and just after Andrew lost his title, so for me there is a pretty solid line between that happening then, and the very sad murder of a man at mosque just after the second trench has been released and the British government has taken any action in the form of these arrests.  

To make these look like related incidents, in terms of temporal and circumstantial context. But I'm not counter terrorism, and I'm sure those guys can work it out.  

Clearly, I don't understand that holding up a sign is very obviously terrorism, so what would I know?

[I think we can say about the parties on the left have essentially united in support of one candidate, as a united front against the far right.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5ndd47/)  

I don't think the rest of us know what to call labour these days; we do understand the baggage in the history, but it's really difficult to see how it's a leftist party in many ways, not least in this matter in particular.

[Until I see anyone else heckling at the potential child rapist who is running from investigation, I do not need to hear anything but defence and praise for Ilhan Omar.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5n137F/)  

You can all have the decorum back when we are not looking at the big orange nonce every day. Do you understand how many conversations I've had with people who do live in the United States, who find that looking at a rapist every day on the news to be incredibly triggering? The fact that they have to look at someone who is at the very least guilty of crimes which amount to our public understanding of rape, and this was before we got the Epstein drop.

[This would be sensible use of soft power happening right here.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5nBNBX/)  

It is now algorithmically impossible to speak about them, without increasing algorithmic pressure on the subject of Palestine; this is incredibly smart as a move.  

it's actually very difficult to pin down the precise origin of that, which is why whoever thought of that one probably needs a raise.  

[A Duke and Duchess essentially taking part in what looks like a teaching round delivered by your seniors, is not unnoticed.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5ndreb/) It's a habit that a lot of doctors are in - this is the style in which you teach students, and if you listen to what's being said, they are essentially being taught, albeit not as medical students. I think the most interesting perspective is actually that of the Palestinian teenage girl who is in the position of watching them, as an observer to them processing what is being said. Whilst primary language is not English, and this is betrayed by a small piece of Arabic that is spoken, it is interesting to see how she is observing them; most of what we pick up from other people during conversation it is in fact their tone in their body language. She gets to make the final assessment, and while this is not necessarily the intent of the reporting, it is inherently included in it.  

[What is really significant about this, as well, is allowing a Palestinian teenage girl should be of her own heritage.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5nYbtk/)  

The keffiyah, is not a terrorist symbol, unless your mind is so small that it cannot hold in its heart a teenage girl who is on her way to becoming a young woman, who has suffered in this way because of where she lives, and where she was born, irrespective of anything she has done or not done in her life.

We can have the disorder part, but we are all talking about the actual crime bit that came as a result of someone having the disorder, so this is not cool and it's not edgy and it's not liberal and the New York Crimes can go and fuck itself for to be quite honest, quite a lot of of its recent reporting.  

Why is this recirculating, can we ask? perhaps our esteemed information inteligence colleagues to look at the cause there?

By the by, if I find in retrospect that any portion of the request has been held because of the by election, I know exactly which two political parties I am going to eviscerate for that. The one who isn't in government definitely does know something; you are going to need to give me an incredibly specific date and an incredibly specific origin on the request.
