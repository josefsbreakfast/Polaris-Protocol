[I, too, have some questions for the RAF, regarding trafficking, and provisions for safeguarding underage females.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5tsG9L/)  

Who the hell did you give/not check access of my Welbeck data to?  

Anyone who knew, the MOD as a whole stop speaking to me during the subject access request process, when I confirmed that the data should be handled under the Children's Act, and that I was denied any meaningful ability to consent to its current use. I don't know if this means they've identified a problem that they're actually doing something about, or if this means that they are just trying to make the problem go away.  

I would suggest at this point it's quite difficult to make a problem go go away. I would like to see some of this and it's over potentially in the humble address request, because what on earth has been done with it?  

I have never been a Crown Servant, it should not be protected under "national security" unless you've done something particularly unhinged with it, and it is not unrelated of data from a Crown Court trial that has gone missing.  

I'm finding it very difficult to understand why it appears the law applies to everyone else except from me; what the fuck did anyone do with my fucking data, and why have I needed to clarify my nationality to everyone, and why has the FCDO returned no record of any embassy use of any of my data?  

(To be fair, I think tzippy does pull in a "terrorist" ticket on basically anyone Jewish who says anything that she doesn't like outside her embassy, which in the state of Israel under the mandate laws, is technically a correct definition of the word terrorist _according to her government only **and should not be applied within the UK**_.)  

there is a cold water of people who have been defending your democracy here, consistently, for three years, against misuse of these terms; it is political people who have been distorting the capacity for this country to see that none of these laws should be applied as if the UK were in wartime, because no such declaration has been made to the parliament of the United Kingdom, yet in many cases the laws regarding this are being applied as if we are currently within a wartime period. I ask the honourable readership to please wake up if you have not already. You need to stop looking at this as a right or left issue, because the people who are spearheading the current anti-democratic attempt, are not. They are just looking at it as territorial control, which to be fair is a lot more intelligent than "which side of a specific building does this person sit on". Nor have they all come with one nationality, nor are they all particularly motivated by the same thing, other than a very specific type of governance being in situ, which requires democracy to be undermined. Some of them are just here for the bank.  

This is why I find the term "asset" more helpful. You need to look beyond what was possible only with traditional intelligence and traditional borders, and look at what is possible now that you have the digital infrastructure that you have.  

Likud might be aligned, but it doesn't represent the whole picture necessarily, nor does the territory they operate in, represent the entire picture. It's very deregulated though, and it's very opportunistic, politically. Given how close it is to being bankrupt at given time recently, you have to anticipate that perhaps there will be more than just the traditional allies assisting such an entity. If you genuinely believed that the State of Israel was absolutely necessary for our survival, why would you let it fall by maintaining only loyal support to the West, if they couldn't bankroll you? The answer is: you wouldn't let it fall on those terms. You would reassess alliances accordingly.  

Especially if you felt the West had been infiltrated by the "woke leftist extremists". Doesn't that originate as Russian political speech, anyway? As in PutinProm speech?  

Oh wait, I forgot, you can't possibly be both right wing and infiltrated by Russia, according to the prevent guidelines in training. My bad. Tell your little tsarina bear friend I said hi. I'll stay here defending our island. It's cool.

[The rest that have been made, from holding signs up, even though the prescription has been found to be unlawful, are still going ahead.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5tEwey/) but we can't call a murder at a mosque with armed men, in the same area as a similar attack at a synagogue that was called terrorism, terrorism?  

MI5, The Home Office, prevent, you guys need to sit down and put your heads together, because something is not adding up in this.  

just please make it make any sense. Just any sense at all.  

this is also why it's not possible in this country to have a synagogue which is not actively taking aside on British foreign policy, in line with what Britain is currently putting forward as it's foreign policy, because the synagogue would lose its public protection, but remain at high risk. I'm not meaning to take away from the horrible murder of a young Muslim man. I'm trying to show how ridiculous these rules are, and how they act actively constrain minority religions in this country.  

Every religion that is not Christian, is still constrained by needing to prove that it is not some sort of hot house for terrorists; when that is the case, how can we call ourselves a democracy? The point of democracy is to have plurality. Why do we have to be on side with everything that the British government wants to do in the foreign office, just to get adequate protection from the violent bigots that we apparently cannot get rid of?  

If you want to even it out, I'm going to need to see some Anglican bishops get frisked.

I guess it's not the type of neighbourhood where you can count on a neighbour to "borrow the telly" from round the back, before they come in.

I think part of the reason why I'm remembering the synagogue attack so vividly, it's because it was just after the first of Epstein files and just after Andrew lost his title, so for me there is a pretty solid line between that happening then, and the very sad murder of a man at mosque just after the second trench has been released and the British government has taken any action in the form of these arrests.  

To make these look like related incidents, in terms of temporal and circumstantial context. But I'm not counter terrorism, and I'm sure those guys can work it out.  

Clearly, I don't understand that holding up a sign is very obviously terrorism, so what would I know?

You can all have the decorum back when we are not looking at the big orange nonce every day. Do you understand how many conversations I've had with people who do live in the United States, who find that looking at a rapist every day on the news to be incredibly triggering? The fact that they have to look at someone who is at the very least guilty of crimes which amount to our public understanding of rape, and this was before we got the Epstein drop.

It is now algorithmically impossible to speak about them, without increasing algorithmic pressure on the subject of Palestine; this is incredibly smart as a move.  

It's actually very difficult to pin down the precise origin of that, which is why whoever thought of that one probably needs a raise.  

[A Duke and Duchess essentially taking part in what looks like a teaching round delivered by your seniors, is not unnoticed.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5ndreb/) It's a habit that a lot of doctors are in - this is the style in which you teach students, and if you listen to what's being said, they are essentially being taught, albeit not as medical students. I think the most interesting perspective is actually that of the Palestinian teenage girl who is in the position of watching them, as an observer to them processing what is being said. Whilst primary language is not English, and this is betrayed by a small piece of Arabic that is spoken, it is interesting to see how she is observing them; most of what we pick up from other people during conversation it is in fact their tone in their body language. She gets to make the final assessment, and while this is not necessarily the intent of the reporting, it is inherently included in it.  

[What is really significant about this, as well, is allowing a Palestinian teenage girl should be of her own heritage.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5nYbtk/)  

The keffiyah, is not a terrorist symbol, unless your mind is so small that it cannot hold in its heart a teenage girl who is on her way to becoming a young woman, who has suffered in this way because of where she lives, and where she was born, irrespective of anything she has done or not done in her life.

Why is this recirculating, can we ask? perhaps our esteemed information inteligence colleagues to look at the cause there?

[Repeating that it is damning of European democracy, and of its pretenses of not wanting the blood of women on its hands, to be in the position that lawmakers are having to push this so strongly for the upcoming vote that secures safe and legal access to the procedures sometimes known as abortion, but which include the procedures to treat miscarriage where it is not possible to safely pass without intervention, because there is no adequate safeguarding of our digital interfaces so has to be protected from the people who want to push for women to be excluded from a part of necessary women's health healthcare, that significant capital is still invested for algorthmic influence on the matter.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5n6xrB/)  

If your religion is not about butchering women, and if your political opinions do not include the unnecessary death of women, there is no capacity to say that this is a religious issue; you must always support safe and legal access, because to withhold that matter condemns women to death.  

Trust me, I used to "not believe in it". I still believe you should be able to access it if you wanted it, but clearly I've done a lot of work on myself since then, and actually found out what it entails, and find out what harms I would be supporting if I didn't engage in safe and legal access more widely, including if I was a medical professional delivering the procedure myself. I actually have a lot of very wonderful people to thank for that, but I'm assuming that they probably don't want to be named on the Internet. Always be curious. Sometimes we even find out that we are wrong, and sometimes it pertains to an incredibly important matter.  

In the time that I have been online, there are a number of men who are clearly trying to work out why I am pro-choice; in order to save God winning who do not yet have safe and legal access, I refuse to state publicly my gynaecology history pertaining to this. I am thinking about this, however, and I am open to thoughts from other people who have uteruses or who are treated as if they do, only.  

<!--Partially I just like the tiny little bit of unresolved territory in the minds of some of these alt right men who hateread me, who apparently have also considered whether or not I have an actual penis before. I don't hate that that goes on for some of them.

That's how they see penises; why can't I?-->

I just got another piece of holocaust material again, so I'm wondering whether or not this is actually a deliberate thing by the Alt-right guys, or is it more of a algorithmic response to when you view my content?

We are geolocating to Notting Hill now, which the last time I checked? It was quite a way aways from Poland.  

I also getting very specifically tickets on south-eastern, from London to Rochester, so if this is you, you might just want to know that you are very highly scoring in our combined algorithmic placement right now.  

I do not live in either of these places, and I do not regularly take journeys on south-eastern.  

I have two further the locations, but they're a little bit too specific, and one of them contains an architectural commissioned new build. This is how much the digital infrastructure at its current time shares all of our data with each other. This is why this is something that needs regulation. You can see that I'm already not holding back on a lot of things, but the fact that I'm stating it's so niche that it feels like a privacy issue to post it, should tell you how much this desperately needs regulation.  

I have had locations that have come up consistently again and again, which have only disappeared once I have them shown clearly on my phone screen that it is possible to niche down exactly who it is that must have the access all that knowledge, and then the location is disappeared for weeks or months. This is not something which can be easily overcome by just having very good cyber security hygiene. This is something which is very much part of our data in infrastructure, and when you regard people as terrorists and you then end up showing that information to them... can you see how I am not just necessarily "smart" or "intuitive"? Can you see why the way in which we are currently going about counterterrorism monitoring is inherently a security issue? If the same actors in the UK really thought about it, it would be incredibly easy at a higher state security level than that, to hide your location, but to still monitor individuals in the UK within our government structure, and that would not necessarily be apparent through algorithmic placement monitoring done by you yourself. This needs regulation if you want to protect our democracy from external actors; anyone suggesting that we shouldn't be legislating for software that works like Pegasus (but the NSO certainly isn't the only provider), is it declaring their interest upfront, and their interest is not the security of these Islands.  

The only group of people who would instrument have their lives made harder by this, is anyone actively grafting off the counterterrorism sector (I'm happy for these people to lose their cut from the taxpayer), or alternatively, anyone actively utilising these loopholes in security to harm other people in this country (I am also happy for these people to lose their cut from the taxpayer).  

I can also tell that one of you, this morning, is choosing to treat a bad back with codeine and volterol. I mean it could be a bad knee, but I'm gonna go on the economics that I've also had advertise to me, it's probably a bad back, and you're probably not doing the physio exercises you've been told to do. You also seem to be new to this, because you're not choosing heat or times or ice.  

This is how intimately you can get to know people without meaning to; the infrastructure requires securing and it requires regulation.  

I can go further and say you've almost certainly got sciatic nerve pain; this is "man in 50s meets gardening task", type clinical vignette. if we want to play the game of probabilistic AI targeting, I could go further in the state a likely cluster of occupation, and a likely exercise history over the last 20 to 30 years, which I'm going to imagine differs significantly from what we were doing in university. (Depending on how much of circles you are actually counting as being part of the sport.)
