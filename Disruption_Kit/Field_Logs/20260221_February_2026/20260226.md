Who the hell did you give/not check access of my Welbeck data to?  

Anyone who knew, the MOD as a whole stop speaking to me during the subject access request process, when I confirmed that the data should be handled under the Children's Act, and that I was denied any meaningful ability to consent to its current use. I don't know if this means they've identified a problem that they're actually doing something about, or if this means that they are just trying to make the problem go away.  

I would suggest at this point it's quite difficult to make a problem go go away. I would like to see some of this and it's over potentially in the humble address request, because what on earth has been done with it?  

I have never been a Crown Servant, it should not be protected under "national security" unless you've done something particularly unhinged with it, and it is not unrelated of data from a Crown Court trial that has gone missing.  

I'm finding it very difficult to understand why it appears the law applies to everyone else except from me; what the fuck did anyone do with my fucking data, and why have I needed to clarify my nationality to everyone, and why has the FCDO returned no record of any embassy use of any of my data?  

(To be fair, I think tzippy does pull in a "terrorist" ticket on basically anyone Jewish who says anything that she doesn't like outside her embassy, which in the state of Israel under the mandate laws, is technically a correct definition of the word terrorist _according to her government only **and should not be applied within the UK**_.)
