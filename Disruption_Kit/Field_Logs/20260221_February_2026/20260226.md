[I, too, have some questions for the RAF, regarding trafficking, and provisions for safeguarding underage females.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5tsG9L/)  

Who the hell did you give/not check access of my Welbeck data to?  

Anyone who knew, the MOD as a whole stop speaking to me during the subject access request process, when I confirmed that the data should be handled under the Children's Act, and that I was denied any meaningful ability to consent to its current use. I don't know if this means they've identified a problem that they're actually doing something about, or if this means that they are just trying to make the problem go away.  

I would suggest at this point it's quite difficult to make a problem go go away. I would like to see some of this and it's over potentially in the humble address request, because what on earth has been done with it?  

I have never been a Crown Servant, it should not be protected under "national security" unless you've done something particularly unhinged with it, and it is not unrelated of data from a Crown Court trial that has gone missing.  

I'm finding it very difficult to understand why it appears the law applies to everyone else except from me; what the fuck did anyone do with my fucking data, and why have I needed to clarify my nationality to everyone, and why has the FCDO returned no record of any embassy use of any of my data?  

(To be fair, I think tzippy does pull in a "terrorist" ticket on basically anyone Jewish who says anything that she doesn't like outside her embassy, which in the state of Israel under the mandate laws, is technically a correct definition of the word terrorist _according to her government only **and should not be applied within the UK**_.)  

there is a cold water of people who have been defending your democracy here, consistently, for three years, against misuse of these terms; it is political people who have been distorting the capacity for this country to see that none of these laws should be applied as if the UK were in wartime, because no such declaration has been made to the parliament of the United Kingdom, yet in many cases the laws regarding this are being applied as if we are currently within a wartime period. I ask the honourable readership to please wake up if you have not already. you need to stop looking at this as I like right or left, aren't you, because the people who are spearheading the current anti-democratic attempt, are not. They are just looking at it as territorial control, which to be fair is a lot more intelligent than "which side of a specific building does this person sit on". Nor have they all come with one nationality, nor are they all particularly motivated by the same thing, other than a very specific type of governance being in situ, which requires democracy to be undermined. Some of them are just here for the bank.  

This is why I find the term "asset" more helpful. You need to look beyond what was possible only with traditional intelligence and traditional borders, and look at what is possible now that you have the digital infrastructure that you have.  

Likud might be aligned, but it doesn't represent the whole picture necessarily, nor does the territory they operate in, represent the entire picture. It's very deregulated though, and it's very opportunistic, politically. Given how close it is to being bankrupt at given time recently, you have to anticipate that perhaps there will be more than just the traditional allies assisting such an entity. If you genuinely believed that the State of Israel was absolutely necessary for our survival, why would you let it fall by maintaining only loyal support to the West, if they couldn't bankroll you? The answer is: you wouldn't let it fall on those terms. You would reassess alliances accordingly.  

Especially if you felt the West had been infiltrated by the "woke leftist extremists". Doesn't that originate as Russian political speech, anyway? As in PutinProm speech?  

Oh wait, I forgot, you can't possibly be both right wing and infiltrated by Russia, according to the prevent guidelines in training. My bad. Tell your little tsarina bear friend I said hi. I'll stay here defending our island. It's cool.

[The rest that have been made, from holding signs up, even though the prescription has been found to be unlawful, are still going ahead.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5tEwey/) but we can't call a murder at a mosque with armed men, in the same area as a similar attack at a synagogue that was called terrorism, terrorism?  

MI5, The Home Office, prevent, you guys need to sit down and put your heads together, because something is not adding up in this.  

just please make it make any sense. Just any sense at all.  

this is also why it's not possible in this country to have a synagogue which is not actively taking aside on British foreign policy, in line with what Britain is currently putting forward as it's foreign policy, because the synagogue would lose its public protection, but remain at high risk. I'm not meaning to take away from the horrible murder of a young Muslim man. I'm trying to show how ridiculous these rules are, and how they act actively constrain minority religions in this country.  

Every religion that is not Christian, is still constrained by needing to prove that it is not some sort of hot house for terrorists; when that is the case, how can we call ourselves a democracy? The point of democracy is to have plurality. Why do we have to be on side with everything that the British government wants to do in the foreign office, just to get adequate protection from the violent bigots that we apparently cannot get rid of?  

If you want to even it out, I'm going to need to see some Anglican bishops get frisked.
