I'm not casting literary style aside, I'm just fixing skeletons before making the same nodes sound nice again.  

This will be a theme over future weeks, as things get built to represent their place in a larger system, rather than just, "ahhhhh I need a *somewhere* to put this!!".  

This is an example of "sometimes the house looks a bit shit whilst you're fixing it up".  

We can normalise "being in progress"; nothing needs to be shiny from the get.

The entitled little LLM gremlin does appear to have come back to haint, so tapping out for now; the text efits are getting weirder and drift is sticking. (Not correcting even when using prompts to correct errors, repeating exactly the same error, which obviously is a good way to wind People up. I am tired and I will not be engaging in this game.)  

I often find this annoying explicitly because you then have to make a decision of whether or not it's worth correcting, because the amount of time you spent doing it, you have to weigh against what's already in the chat, and then decide whether or not you want to create a new chat. With projects that require instructions and several prompts to get it going, this is inherently very annoying.  

I know it got stuck on with democratic recovery, safeguarding of British democracy, and anything about a sock puppet campaign which was adjacent to the hunger strikers for Palestine.

The comments are telling.  

Unfortunately, it's actually quite difficult to look into the story, specifically because there is this really performed anti-trans language. The reason why we all came up with this queer theory and gender theory informed language, to describe trans people accurately, is because of the confusion that previously existed. Now, because half of you can't decide whether or not to be angry if you're attracted to someone, we have this whole situation and where it's actually really difficult to understand who is referring to who.  

Just for the record, you have made it more complicated, not easier.  

Okay, yeah, I know after a few more videos, I'm definitely in an alt right algorithmic placement, please the love of G-d come and rescue me.  

It's almost as if we are looking for stories. The experience of whichever party is what I'm being placed with, is almost like we are a researcher for a particularly nutty group peddling alt right nonsense.  

Again, please for the love of G-d, get me out of here. If no one can fix the data, can you just get the other side of the centroid to all quit their jobs? Do we need to sue to get a company under, I'm happy to do it at this point. [Just reminding us all, this is who they worship as their king.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58cJ6G/)  

[Let us see if we can predict a certain news channel's headlines for tomorrow.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58cumb/)  

[I suppose this might be a little awkward for them to cover, I don't think they really know what their audience wants as far as the Royals go.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58Q58A/) it's quite interesting because there's two very different demographics that clash for them.  

I mean, what would help all of us as if you could tell us how you managed to get the algorithmic AI product?  

[This is frequently what I'm getting advertised properties, and while looking at properties exclusively in the south of England, which I think is a terrible idea. It's full of Southerners. Why would you want that?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58X8oT/)  

If this is still the Breitbart Britain lot, why is it that you are so closely tied to me? Because we're tired not just like you're reading this, we're tied like there's been some splicing. and look, clearly I will come down like a ton of bricks if I need to, as you can plainly see, but that doesn't mean that you're safe. Who gave you the information you needed, who gave you the product?  

Bet you're really glad I let you have the extra two months. Please note the *exact* wording for legal purposes in my responses.  

[Complaining about a group of people as communists when you're all literally trying to match each other, with all your perfectly alike flags in the right size in the right material, you're all wearing the same clothes... I mean it's not looking not communist.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58HyRG/)  

You complain about sheep, and yet.  

The feed actually looks like it's probably representing two or three different people, clustered together as the other portion.  

We are definitely proving for opinions about Iran. We only have what could possibly be one party that is placed near the Red Sea. There is something which is very interested in labour policy, particular elections, and there is something which is interested in the perception of reform during the election.  

I don't think spying on a Jewish woman is part of the rules that are approved by the electoral commission.  

And I don't know who gave out the information, who would have access to the electoral register, and also know that I was Jewish, but given the course of conduct over time, regardless of how this squares up in terms of the legal accountability, please understand this particular behaviour towards people who are like Me does not usually have a good outcome for people like me, and it is inherently quite alarming.  

I am really tired of going through this.  

I am really tired of the fact that whatever holds so much control over how my data is used, has not yet been neutralised as a threat.  

I'm really tired of listening to the institutional Darvo, and having to tolerate being framed as a crazy lady; I don't even think I care who this is at this point, but whoever is sitting in this weird space of being previously labour aligned but now somehow very far right, I'm not interested in being part of your little data bubble.  

I'm sick and tired of being farmed for opinions and behavioural proxy behaviour. I'm so tired of it.  

I'm almost at 2.5m words, and whilst there are significant changes, the base issue still isn't sorted, and I'm literally in a legal gridlock. I really hope that this resolved tomorrow with the deadline on one of the subject access requests. I really hope that it does. I don't know what touch my days are in 2016, but there is a line that can be drawn from that, and my current experience of essentially being watched by the slg right. This does not feel inherently safe.  

[Are we just going to watch men twatting around with flags all day?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5LLN2k/)  

[I'm also getting these edits on repeat, which is not helping.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5LNg4a/) can I ask whichever weird man is, to please fuck off? Seeing as I literally cannot report it to the police because I've already tried so many times, and I've already tried the oversight for a policing. Kindly just fuck off and leave me alone.  

[Respectfully, what is this, in a Jewish woman's feed?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58wGvQ/)  

They should show that this is what this experience is like, and it has times where it gets worse, there are times where it gets angrier, there are times where it starts to really shame women and women's bodies, there are times when it becomes even more "forced conversion", and I'm just tired of the fact that there was literally nowhere in this country that you're allowed to go or can go and say hey, I don't know what's doing this, but it's clearly being done and it's very temporal to my emails as well, so it suggests that there's something in the counterterrorism space which just hates women.  

(Given that it's also incredibly alt right, I'm going to guess that being a Jewish woman is a problem; I understand how I am sometimes very fetish, unlike to a literal object with no personality, even more so than a white woman. I have been denied every single route that exists to report this, and I have commonly been given the incorrect advice.)  

It's as if I'm supposed to be being operant conditioned to hate myself, to not write publically but still react for device data capture, and to fold myself into nothing. It's as if something or someone wants to erase me, but quietly.  

The way that this reflecivly gets kinder, but only if I say it publically, suggests that someone in this data bubble is able to recognise that it's harmful and is trying to improve the skew. I literally don't know who knows what, and it's frustrating that so far, I'm left in silence.  

I am terrofied that one of the key stakeholders will ignore the deadline tomorrow out of embarrassment, because that's become so normal in this process.  

I literally have at least one neonazi with a badge who floods the feed with controlling misogynistic content; bet they talk the ihra talk in public because why else would you snoop on a Jew like this.
