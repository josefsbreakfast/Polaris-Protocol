I'm not casting literary style aside, I'm just fixing skeletons before making the same nodes sound nice again.  

This will be a theme over future weeks, as things get built to represent their place in a larger system, rather than just, "ahhhhh I need a *somewhere* to put this!!".  

This is an example of "sometimes the house looks a bit shit whilst you're fixing it up".  

We can normalise "being in progress"; nothing needs to be shiny from the get.

The entitled little LLM gremlin does appear to have come back to haint, so tapping out for now; the text efits are getting weirder and drift is sticking. (Not correcting even when using prompts to correct errors, repeating exactly the same error, which obviously is a good way to wind People up. I am tired and I will not be engaging in this game.)  

I often find this annoying explicitly because you then have to make a decision of whether or not it's worth correcting, because the amount of time you spent doing it, you have to weigh against what's already in the chat, and then decide whether or not you want to create a new chat. With projects that require instructions and several prompts to get it going, this is inherently very annoying.  

I know it got stuck on with democratic recovery, safeguarding of British democracy, and anything about a sock puppet campaign which was adjacent to the hunger strikers for Palestine.  

[This was very quickly after a filton 24 release video, and a labour election video.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58Ga9s/)  
The comments are telling.  

Unfortunately, it's actually quite difficult to look into the story, specifically because there is this really performed anti-trans language. The reason why we all came up with this queer theory and gender theory informed language, to describe trans people accurately, is because of the confusion that previously existed. Now, because half of you can't decide whether or not to be angry if you're attracted to someone, we have this whole situation and where it's actually really difficult to understand who is referring to who.  

Just for the record, you have made it more complicated, not easier.  

Okay, yeah, I know after a few more videos, I'm definitely in an alt right algorithmic placement, please the love of G-d come and rescue me.  

It's almost as if we are looking for stories. The experience of whichever party is what I'm being placed with, is almost like we are a researcher for a particularly nutty group peddling alt right nonsense.  

Again, please for the love of G-d, get me out of here. If no one can fix the data, can you just get the other side of the centroid to all quit their jobs? Do we need to sue to get a company under, I'm happy to do it at this point. [Just reminding us all, this is who they worship as their king.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58cJ6G/)

I mean, what would help all of us as if you could tell us how you managed to get the algorithmic AI product?

If this is still the Breitbart Britain lot, why is it that you are so closely tied to me? Because we're tired not just like you're reading this, we're tied like there's been some splicing. and look, clearly I will come down like a ton of bricks if I need to, as you can plainly see, but that doesn't mean that you're safe. Who gave you the information you needed, who gave you the product?  

Bet you're really glad I let you have the extra two months. Please note the *exact* wording for legal purposes in my responses.

You complain about sheep, and yet.  

The feed actually looks like it's probably representing two or three different people, clustered together as the other portion.  

We are definitely proving for opinions about Iran. We only have what could possibly be one party that is placed near the Red Sea. There is something which is very interested in labour policy, particular elections, and there is something which is interested in the perception of reform during the election.  

I don't think spying on a Jewish woman is part of the rules that are approved by the electoral commission.  

And I don't know who gave out the information, who would have access to the electoral register, and also know that I was Jewish, but given the course of conduct over time, regardless of how this squares up in terms of the legal accountability, please understand this particular behaviour towards people who are like Me does not usually have a good outcome for people like me, and it is inherently quite alarming.  

I am really tired of going through this.  

I am really tired of the fact that whatever holds so much control over how my data is used, has not yet been neutralised as a threat.  

I'm really tired of listening to the institutional Darvo, and having to tolerate being framed as a crazy lady; I don't even think I care who this is at this point, but whoever is sitting in this weird space of being previously labour aligned but now somehow very far right, I'm not interested in being part of your little data bubble.  

I'm sick and tired of being farmed for opinions and behavioural proxy behaviour. I'm so tired of it.  

I'm almost at 2.5m words, and whilst there are significant changes, the base issue still isn't sorted, and I'm literally in a legal gridlock. I really hope that this resolved tomorrow with the deadline on one of the subject access requests. I really hope that it does. I don't know what touch my days are in 2016, but there is a line that can be drawn from that, and my current experience of essentially being watched by the slg right. This does not feel inherently safe.

[I'm also getting these edits on repeat, which is not helping.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5LNg4a/) can I ask whichever weird man is, to please fuck off? Seeing as I literally cannot report it to the police because I've already tried so many times, and I've already tried the oversight for a policing. Kindly just fuck off and leave me alone.  

[Respectfully, what is this, in a Jewish woman's feed?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR58wGvQ/)  

They should show that this is what this experience is like, and it has times where it gets worse, there are times where it gets angrier, there are times where it starts to really shame women and women's bodies, there are times when it becomes even more "forced conversion", and I'm just tired of the fact that there was literally nowhere in this country that you're allowed to go or can go and say hey, I don't know what's doing this, but it's clearly being done and it's very temporal to my emails as well, so it suggests that there's something in the counterterrorism space which just hates women.  

(Given that it's also incredibly alt right, I'm going to guess that being a Jewish woman is a problem; I understand how I am sometimes very fetish, unlike to a literal object with no personality, even more so than a white woman. I have been denied every single route that exists to report this, and I have commonly been given the incorrect advice.)  

It's as if I'm supposed to be being operant conditioned to hate myself, to not write publically but still react for device data capture, and to fold myself into nothing. It's as if something or someone wants to erase me, but quietly.  

The way that this reflecivly gets kinder, but only if I say it publically, suggests that someone in this data bubble is able to recognise that it's harmful and is trying to improve the skew. I literally don't know who knows what, and it's frustrating that so far, I'm left in silence.  

I am terrofied that one of the key stakeholders will ignore the deadline tomorrow out of embarrassment, because that's become so normal in this process.  

I literally have at least one neonazi with a badge who floods the feed with controlling misogynistic content; bet they talk the ihra talk in public because why else would you snoop on a Jew like this.   

[🤨](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5Lh9Xo/)  
I'm done recording this. I've had everything taken and stripped from me. I never deserved any of what I've faced from this. SAR tomorrow, and if you're all silent, it escalates lefally, with/without the 5501s when I try to get legal rep.  

I am now getting posts about NMO and SPOs; I was denied, because the East Midlands does not work. I have tried every route; I am not allowed to be safe. That's why we're here writing this ridiculous repo about power structures.  

I am also aware that this means, probably, but whatever this is is currently feeling under discretion, and is feeling like it needs to chuck males under the bus. Could be interesting.

["A master of spin who, in the end, was largely lying to himself"](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio/2026/02/17/the-tony-blair-story-a-master-of-spin-who-in-the-end-was-largely-lying-to-himself/) I'm dying. 💀💀💀  

Why is this half-a-man (40% plastic, 10% veneers), still in politics?  

How is he still here?  

"brimming with charm yet blank behind the eyes" - pretty sure that's a reletive compliament, actually.  

Review of same, from the Guardian: "...where major events happen because a personality has **imposed itself** on the world?"  

"...took up politics in the early 1980s and vowed not just to become a Labour MP, but to lead profound reform of the party". Translation: Had confusing thoughts about Margaret Thatcher being a Whip, and incorrectly applied Conservative policy to Labour.  
"But The Tony Blair Story finds the Blair cult of personality a little too alluring." What personality?  

Idk this just feels like we're mourning for when computers yellowed and got scuzz in the nooks, and floppy disks were a flex.  

"It’s being billed as “landmark”, which here just means long"; New Statesman is also over this shit.  

"When he says, as he does often, that something was 'the right thing to do', you know you’re witnessing not a statement of political rhetoric, but one of political belief.  

Honestly if I knew what I'd done on false pretenses, to make money from oil, and how many bunker busters had brought forth so many dead children, I would probably repeat that sentence like a mantra to myself, too.  

It must be nice to bevable to ignore alk the dead children.  

Like the dead children of Gaza.  

Oh, look. We are... not learning at all, it seems.  

What gives us the right?  

What gives us the right, as people from a tiny island, to go and cause such catastrophe somewhere else in the world? You can't do this and not believe on some level that either, you're above people, or that your actions don't come with consequences.  

We were supposed to be able to trust politicians to take us into war only when it was considered just.  

That war was not just, and this war is not just.  

It's very tempting to use a clinical word and an adjective, here.

[This stuff is truly hilarious because you all know that I need an FOIA naming him, specifically.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5Ls78v/)  


Because our country protects one of the roles in particular, you all know that I can't speak out against him until I have a piece of favour that I'm very unlikely to get, so anybody really feels that I'm the one who should be able to raise something more easily, I'm afraid not. I can only prove it through bureaucracy because he's such a fucking moron when it comes to paperwork, and he's been doing it for 20 years.  


But if you think that he didn't rotate me to fucking every surface in the world, you obviously don't know how about the man can be.  

Imagine what it must be like, if there is plausible deniability and anonymity essentially promised to him.  

That's my position. Telling me to look elsewhere, although I need to look further, or that somebody else will have it, none of this actually helps. 
Silence is betrayal.  

At least if what you want to do is to self-protect, or to self-preserve, just to be fucking honest about it.  

---

All I know for sure, is that whatever it is, and this could be an average of more than one person, is a massive blairite, in office during the second cabinet when my data first went missing, is supposedly labour voting but also fucking loves a bit of Nazi right wing, has a superficial ability to appease you but essentially enjoys the process of watching you pain and your struggle; it's probably a barrister, and lives between legal, policy, and counterterrorism. I know that it protects and gatekeeps for other abusive men too, so presumably I am not the only woman who's experienced this, and let's remember that I was under age, very under age, when this first happened. Given everything, this is someone who knows vulnerabilities, and weaponising those, is probably the vast majority of their skill.  

Now, if you think that I occupied a particularly strong place in this, it's only because I am so deeply under the skin at this point, because they thought I'd never fight back.  

Snip snip. ✂️  

Given the figures that have been shoved under the bus recently, and the fact that they are men?

[Do we need to start asking the lodges nicely? I really do just feel that some of you could be a little more honest.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5Lnm5E/)  

I actually kind of hate it whenever anybody suggests that something that happened that's bad, can be subscribed to a society like the Freemasons, because you can be a Mason and not be a raging dickhead. There's not actually anything in Freemasonry that suggests that you have to do bad shit, anyone who uses the Freemasons as an excuse to do horrific things, is just gonna be doing horrific things wherever they are, they're just kind of feel like this is a sexier way to explain it.  

The concept of brotherhood in Masonry, does not include a sub clause that allows it to be at the expense of women. If you're choosing to do that, that is your choice. No one in the Masons is making you do it.  

freemasonry is actually a very interesting culmination of secular instincts, under incredibly oppressive empirical Christian rule, and it was a way to ensure each other, without necessarily having to be aristocracy. The vast majority of everything that Mason's teach as part of the self improvement style of learning, is that. It is self-improvement. Does it have a lot of concepts from ceremonial magic? Yes, it does. Is that a bad thing? Not inherently.  

The reason that there is tension between loyalty towards other masons, and loyalty to religions for example, really shows how this was one of the first ways in which the merchant class couldn't work outside of business itself, and how you got that first break in societal care system in Europe, and started to build into disciplinary ties. That would've been incredibly scary for the religious authority, as well as it would've been scary for any aristocracy. This is not unrelated to how nuns got banned in many places. (we were obviously all just having a great time without you all.)  

tldr: If someone justifies something bad they did with something about loyalty and Freemasons, they're talking out of their fucking arse.

[Soooo... all of the treaties then?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5LU2C1/)  

we're just going to leave every single treaty, internationally, because a small number of families own the majority of the land in this country, and they personally don't want to give it up so that we can develop a few more houses?  

Do we all hear how insane this sounds?  
Something that I do have to give to the right narrative here, is that while they're drifting of this situation, essentially there is a massive fucking issue, and that could be easily solved if some very rich people pitched in and shared their land.  

I've been in the feed recently day with some very rich people, and I can tell you now, there are some huge estates that could be turned into very livable small hamlet size developmentss.  

Yeah, I dream of a massive house in the country too, but when it comes down to it, we also just need to house people.  

I love it when anybody proposes an idea like this, you'll always get stuff like it will be lower the value of other people's house prices, that it will lose foreign investment... I just thought you really wanted to house people that you felt had done things for your country, and that worked hard and pay taxes. We're not gonna be able to do that if we don't build houses. At this point, can't we just have some land back into the public distribution as a bit of a swap for not going crazy over all of the elites who are coming out out of office?  

Like remove them from post, but we might decide not to do a revolution if we're actually happier and secure and have a roof over our heads?  

I'm not organising one. I'm just saying this would be a really good way to make sure people don't get angry.

So if you know you know, if you're reading this because you're friends with our government gadgie, and you are genuinely giving him the advice which has been responsible for the last 24 to 48 hours, I need you to ask him about the intelligence test style tests from when I was a teenager.  

I know that he is likely to know them, I need you to ask him what the scoring was and where that was in terms of centile. You could also compare and contrast with GAMSAT. And then consider that I read and write slower than I'm able to mentally process, to such an extent that I can get extra time, but I didn't take it for either of those.  

I need you to ask him to be really honest, because I don't think we're playing on the same level.  

He just needs to answer the subject access request, in respect to fulfilling whatever obligations he has to the party that I asked subject access request of, and if this is what is holding up cabinet office he needs to be honest with them as well.  

I know that a lot of people interpret this is sounding arrogant, and that's not how I mean it, because this is only one tiny little bit of who you are as a person or what really answers the question of what intelligence says, believe you may I am dumb as shit in many ways, but I need you to ask him what those scores were. He is not telling you the full truth about who he is dealing with.  

I wasn't just chosen because of empathy or because I looked "cute". I was chosen for my usefulness.

removing my own thoughts and opinions from the actual content of the report, that report that's trying to slander Keir Starmer, because of a decision he made when he was practising as a QC, and for which there are operational reasons to back up what was probably suggested (as much as it is incredibly frustrating; I'm not saying we can't have the conversation of how that policy has errors... you can tell them I'm really choosing my words to keep calm), just seems a bit suspicious to me in the context of the Labour Party, actively trying to clean house.  

It just seems weird to me. Given that we've chucked Mandelson to the bus, his company is behind his administration, Andrew has been arrested (although not laboured connected directly, still in the elite circles), it just seems very strange.  

It almost feels like we are looking for desperate measures at a point where the benzene ring is trying not to collapse, under the pressure of reality.  

I say, labour aligned, not because every single area that has been implicated for child grooming is labour, it's a mix, it's bipartisan, but a number of them are. So it's really difficult to tell whether or not this is a really fair thing to bring up, or whether this is an indication that labour is trying to clean house, and this is a way of trying to undermine the person who is potentially leading on that.  

It would be really helpful if the press could do some very good questions at the level that they have access to these people.  

This is the problem about people who are embedded, and hold social capital, but are doing things that we would generally say are bad things. They often tire a lot of other people up, so it is very difficult to get rid of them without becoming implicated or without being chucked under the bus first yourself.  

The reason I'm suspicious, is that it would seem that that it would be such an obvious report to have brought up a couple of weeks ago. It feels like that would be an obvious report to have brought up during the first I've seen Files released six months ago, it feels like a really obvious report to brought up at any opportunity that you've ever 10 years that he's been leader.  

It feels really strange that it's being brought up now.  

That doesn't mean that it's not relevant, it doesn't mean that it may not have huge error in it, it just feels very strange that this is the timing. I feel like I'm doing a lot of defence of the Prime Minister, I'm not as big as fan, but I really have a lot of ire for, is using serious issues as political porn is, I'm just a bit suspicious about how this entered process.  

It could be completely coincidental, if so, I have to ask about the appropriateness of the release of that information.  

I feel like we had trolling and informed principles at one point, and we just dumped them on the side of the road, and left them.  

About 10 years ago, we had an era of this was almost becoming very normalised. There have been multiple attacks on trauma informed principles since, which is ridiculous, because this is a normal part of practice and law.  

what's really difficult for a lot of people who survived sexual violence, is because you are giving fucking nothing in most ways for most departments and most stakeholders, it becomes difficult not to grab onto any little breadcrumb that is thrown at you.  

I don't make any judgement over survivors who had just trying to get something done, or just trying to get some action. I've learned the very hard way that people will use you as a political porn, and then they'll do fuck all for you although they will cut you down and kick and spit on you at your very worst moments.  

A lot of people will actively seek to use you because they see you as being vulnerable and broken and able to be used.  

That is really the dreadful shame which repeats itself and repeats itself in this country.  

Again, I'm not saying that any particular person is meaning badly in this whole thing, i'm just saying that this is highly suspect timing.  

I'm also very aware of the alt right having a bit of a moment, I'm grooming gang is one of their pet she used to make us scared enough, that we vote for that bunch of morons. Even though they'd basically be happy to turn women into objects legally.

In other news, I'm getting a lot of Rothschild conspiracy theory stuff at the moment, which means that I'm either in a centroid with the alt right, or it means they're sending me this deliberately to wind me up.  

As previously discussed on many occasions, Rothschild is an incredibly common Jewish surname. This is like saying "the Baker Family are all the devil!". Like okay... which Baker family? Are you going to be more specific?  

It's also just pretty weird to be putting the entirety of the world's evil on individual people, and really interesting that you don't pick any white guys.  

Are you saying you seriously can't think of any white billionaires who are essentially are so exploitative that you could make those same insults towards them?  

This is what really pisses me off about the whole world banking conspiracy thing, that seems to be having a resurgence in recent years, because that there are a lot of banks, chiefly full of white people, who are not seen as foreign in their own countries, who make a shit tonne of money, and they seem pretty exploitative tbqh.  

Until I see you angry at the exploitation, and/or that people are doing exploitation as a whole group, I just can't take you seriously. Someone with that specific name could actually genuinely have some sort of crazy horrible set up going on, and I would just be sat here going, "yeah whatever, next".  

I'm also not here saying that the entire family, the one you're thinking of, and all the different parts of that family (because it's a huge family), are absolute saints.  

It's fascinating that this comes as the Epstein file scandal drags on, and I don't think that's coincidental at all. I think I'm just gonna need to buckle up and get used to this for the meantime.  

This is just the world, when people think there's really bad things happening and power doesn't seem to be doing anything huge and explosive, they start to look for hidden secret groups that are the "blockage", and one of the people that they look at are people like me.  

So yeah. I love everything about this.  🫠

So given how much the impersonation attempts have been pushed, and how much these white guys are trying to racial Muslim men directly in the digital harassment inexperience, I have no idea if this is true or not, but as discussed earlier, all men who have power in this world are the same fucking men. [So if we're still trying to make Project Esther UK Edition happen, can we not?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5NhbDh/)  

i'm not interested in this bullshit, but I am recording it because it is very interesting. This is happening just before the subject request is due back, because we're not in office hours yet, which means that the third-party that held on for six months under some form of gag order, may not yet have turned in their paperwork to the labour party.  

And I am far more interested in that, then I am about whatever weird racialised sex fantasy you guys are having, as predominantly white men.  

This may or may not involve my favourite embassy. Somewhat difficult to tell.  

It does however involve a huge amount of racism, perpetrated by, I imagine completely, but I'm going to say at least majority white guys.  

These men, and there may be one or two women are not saying they can't be, or specifically threatened by the fact that I have had in the past partners you'll have melanin that exceeds my own.  

Do we all appreciate the level of masculinised white psychosis that would need to be present for this to be something that you keep pushing into a woman's feed, to the extent that this is a course of conduct over years?  

The fact that it's accompanied by some of old US and UK aircraft recon from like months or years ago, does suggest that someone is trying to repost those, in order to build up the association.  

This is an attempt of intimidation, impersonation, and slander, towards the current MOD member of staff.
