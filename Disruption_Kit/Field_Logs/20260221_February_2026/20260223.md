I'm not casting literary style aside, I'm just fixing skeletons before making the same nodes sound nice again.  

This will be a theme over future weeks, as things get built to represent their place in a larger system, rather than just, "ahhhhh I need a *somewhere* to put this!!".  

This is an example of "sometimes the house looks a bit shit whilst you're fixing it up".  

We can normalise "being in progress"; nothing needs to be shiny from the get.

The entitled little LLM gremlin does appear to have come back to haint, so tapping out for now; the text efits are getting weirder and drift is sticking. (Not correcting even when using prompts to correct errors, repeating exactly the same error, which obviously is a good way to wind People up. I am tired and I will not be engaging in this game.)
