I'm not casting literary style aside, I'm just fixing skeletons before making the same nodes sound nice again.  

This will be a theme over future weeks, as things get built to represent their place in a larger system, rather than just, "ahhhhh I need a *somewhere* to put this!!".  

This is an example of "sometimes the house looks a bit shit whilst you're fixing it up".  

We can normalise "being in progress"; nothing needs to be shiny from the get.

The entitled little LLM gremlin does appear to have come back to haint, so tapping out for now; the text efits are getting weirder and drift is sticking. (Not correcting even when using prompts to correct errors, repeating exactly the same error, which obviously is a good way to wind People up. I am tired and I will not be engaging in this game.)  

I often find this annoying explicitly because you then have to make a decision of whether or not it's worth correcting, because the amount of time you spent doing it, you have to weigh against what's already in the chat, and then decide whether or not you want to create a new chat. With projects that require instructions and several prompts to get it going, this is inherently very annoying.  

I know it got stuck on with democratic recovery, safeguarding of British democracy, and anything about a sock puppet campaign which was adjacent to the hunger strikers for Palestine.
