I am working over Shabbos for obvious reasons.  

["When I mention I'm Jewish on the internet, like 12 times a day..."](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPt8Gnc/)  

It do be like that, though.  

I've got more time for people who I can tell I just incredibly hurt inside and so it's almost a reaction thing whenever they see any post, probably.  

I think it just feels so weird to have to clarify it that many times, and I just want to say a special thank you to the WASPie society who helped get us here, whilst putting themselves off the back for being saviours of the Jews. We really couldn't have done it without you.
