I am working over Shabbos for obvious reasons.  

["When I mention I'm Jewish on the internet, like 12 times a day..."](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPt8Gnc/)  

It do be like that, though.  

I've got more time for people who I can tell I just incredibly hurt inside and so it's almost a reaction thing whenever they see any post, probably.  

I think it just feels so weird to have to clarify it that many times, and I just want to say a special thank you to the WASPie society who helped get us here, whilst putting themselves off the back for being saviours of the Jews. We really couldn't have done it without you.

[1. Which classrooms teach kids to shame themselves? 2. What is this ideology you speak of that isn't just biological science applied to our deeply sexist culture? I am confuse.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPtjPLT/)  

but this right I'm gonna end up having to write a note specifically on queer theory because a lot of you are making speeches which are just fundamentally not in line with factual "how the body works" science. I don't think there are mainstream schools that are doing anything which encourages a child to significantly alter the gender expression. I think what you are picking at is very niche parts of guidance, that arguably our only ever delivered in specialist services, and for which there is actually quite a good degree of ignorance across public services regarding. What I don't like about the people who are using this is a talking point, is that refusing to acknowledge the science on trans identity, is part of the reason why we have waiting lists for appropriate clinics to even be assessed, there are so long that a large number of those individuals unfortunately die by suicide. This is preventable death at the hands of a state. To encourage division which piggyback on that blindspot for many people's knowledge, is pretty damn low.  

But you know I also like to do my research, so whilst I do believe that this is probably part of a political strategy which more on more or less lifts off the templates that have been using in the United States and applies them to the UK, I will make sure that I do a little bit more digging for the actual current data point of things before I comment further and put a node up.  

Given that is a genuine concern regarding the United States potentially being in the first stages of genocide in regards to this population, bringing exactly the same trick to this country is.. a choice.  

I also do like the fact that everyone on the extreme right who uses Electric around shamming, essentially is admitting what they themselves are uncomfortable with, in reference to this British history point (I assume that we mean history, when we say that children are being shamed for their identity). It relies on an idea that British people are incredibly fragile, and that children can't process the fact that you can do bad things and do good things at the same time. To assume that children can't cope with that by the time that you even teach British history in an imperial sense - it's pretty telling. I do understand that a lot of the people here are saying it because that's part of the brand, and it's not recently they believe, but for those people who do believe it who are at that policy level - that is ridiculous, and please stop being ridiculous. There is no shame in recognising a dual history where you are part of a group which has both suffered of violence and also perpetrated violence. That is very common in a lot of countries, because of the history of those countries, and it's very common across different identities. Refusing to resolve it as a really strange decision. That's like choosing to live in a state of just being angry and confused, when you could just chill and eat berries.  

Oh, I've just had flashbacks to the particular Conservative Cabinet when Stella was the talking head for bringing this into the training modules, and my goodness did that make the training modules very silly. Listening to you all complain about protesting done by groups like extinction rebellion, at the same time that it was a rising and very serious alt right threat, which obviously didn't get mentioned.. and we don't need to mention it now, clearly there is none of that, nothing ever happened, jobs a guddin let's move on. nothing ever became of that. There was never a report within encounter terrorism about this. Nope. Everything is fine. 🐶🔥
