I am working over Shabbos for obvious reasons.  

["When I mention I'm Jewish on the internet, like 12 times a day..."](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPt8Gnc/)  

It do be like that, though.  

I've got more time for people who I can tell I just incredibly hurt inside and so it's almost a reaction thing whenever they see any post, probably.  

I think it just feels so weird to have to clarify it that many times, and I just want to say a special thank you to the WASPie society who helped get us here, whilst putting themselves off the back for being saviours of the Jews. We really couldn't have done it without you.

[1. Which classrooms teach kids to shame themselves? 2. What is this ideology you speak of that isn't just biological science applied to our deeply sexist culture? I am confuse.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPtjPLT/)  

but this right I'm gonna end up having to write a note specifically on queer theory because a lot of you are making speeches which are just fundamentally not in line with factual "how the body works" science. I don't think there are mainstream schools that are doing anything which encourages a child to significantly alter the gender expression. I think what you are picking at is very niche parts of guidance, that arguably our only ever delivered in specialist services, and for which there is actually quite a good degree of ignorance across public services regarding. What I don't like about the people who are using this is a talking point, is that refusing to acknowledge the science on trans identity, is part of the reason why we have waiting lists for appropriate clinics to even be assessed, there are so long that a large number of those individuals unfortunately die by suicide. This is preventable death at the hands of a state. To encourage division which piggyback on that blindspot for many people's knowledge, is pretty damn low.  

But you know I also like to do my research, so whilst I do believe that this is probably part of a political strategy which more on more or less lifts off the templates that have been using in the United States and applies them to the UK, I will make sure that I do a little bit more digging for the actual current data point of things before I comment further and put a node up.  

Given that is a genuine concern regarding the United States potentially being in the first stages of genocide in regards to this population, bringing exactly the same trick to this country is.. a choice.
