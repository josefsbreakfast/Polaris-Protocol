Given the number of people who were international pride and relations who are impact files, and two investigations into serious misconduct in public office, does anyone like to ask the question about whether or not part of Britain's power is provision of human resource? It's not like we haven't done this before. It's not as other countries don't do it more often than we do.

This is why we need to stop having carveouts for national security, Royal Family, or counterterrorism.  

We can't keep putting key infrastructure car out, we can't keep carving out something that people can hide behind.  

Every time we carve out law, what we are doing is admitting to ourselves that we know that there is something going on that we wouldn't want the public to know about.  

Whether that's a minor embarrassment, or it's an international trade which is grossly illegal, it doesn't matter.  
As long as the harm continues, the public is still going to feel it, they just won't necessarily have the words to put to the issue, but they'll still be angry.  

If you really want the British public to not be angry, we probably need to stay away from things like modern slavery and human trafficking.

So is the reason that you don't like him, and probably set up the whistleblowing, because he has opinions like, "maybe the Middle East should decide his own future"?  

Or is it genuinely just because he can write for more than one sentence and actually sounds like he knows anything at all?  

I think it's been very clear that you are a rote learner, and it literally goes in one year and out the other, just stays in long enough for the exam.  

There's a very little depth of understanding.

Do we need to watch *every* single video?  

What is it that concerns you?
