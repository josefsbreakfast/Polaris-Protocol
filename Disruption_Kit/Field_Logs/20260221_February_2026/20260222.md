Given the number of people who were international pride and relations who are impact files, and two investigations into serious misconduct in public office, does anyone like to ask the question about whether or not part of Britain's power is provision of human resource? It's not like we haven't done this before. It's not as other countries don't do it more often than we do.  

[This has the capacity to impact the defence sector on an international basis, particularly in terms of whether or not there was appropriate action taken when wrongdoing was known.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPEGNbF/)  

This is why we need to stop having carveouts for national security, Royal Family, or counterterrorism.  

We can't keep putting key infrastructure car out, we can't keep carving out something that people can hide behind.  

Every time we carve out law, what we are doing is admitting to ourselves that we know that there is something going on that we wouldn't want the public to know about.  

Whether that's a minor embarrassment, or it's an international trade which is grossly illegal, it doesn't matter.  
As long as the harm continues, the public is still going to feel it, they just won't necessarily have the words to put to the issue, but they'll still be angry.  

If you really want the British public to not be angry, we probably need to stay away from things like modern slavery and human trafficking.

So is the reason that you don't like him, and probably set up the whistleblowing, because he has opinions like, "maybe the Middle East should decide his own future"?  

Or is it genuinely just because he can write for more than one sentence and actually sounds like he knows anything at all?  

I think it's been very clear that you are a rote learner, and it literally goes in one year and out the other, just stays in long enough for the exam.  

There's a very little depth of understanding.

[Why are you so bothered about the search being conducted at that property?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPEo8dM/)  

Do we need to watch *every* single video?  

What is it that concerns you?  

It is not possible to carve out "privacy", when there is a criminal investigation ongoing.  

& yes, we're looking at documents and devices, but we're also putting police in a place where if they do see anything that's obviously immoral or illegal, depending on what they find, that may be included as part of the investigation.  

To use the classical example that we all usually use, if the police stumbled on a load of weed or cocaine, they don't need you just leave it there.  

that's not to say that any of that actually existed at that property, it's just to say that if it did, it would be picked up. Because of the amount of gifts that you can get from being a trade envoy, it wouldn't be completely irrational to be taking actual goods as well.  

[I mean the answer to this whole discussion about the Epstein files and what they were up to, is that they were up to crimes against humanity, and being disgusting.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPE7Ajv/)  

Whenever I hear discussion about this, it's not that hard to look at Regis even in the last hundred years and pick out so many of the things that other regimes have done and look at this and go, "yeah, that tracks".  

These women who are obsessed with control, obsessed with having access to children and young women and young boys, and where and are willing to leverage huge amount amounts of power for their own selfish goals.  

The only thing that is complicated about this, is the difficulty of getting them tried and conflicted now, but a really good way to start that would be to fulfil the US law that requires full disclosure of the files.  
Bear in mind that these are the same people who have done the most to undermine and the road international humanitarian law, and undermine the ICJ.  

They understood that they could go to the Hague.  

when I was first trying to push this past regional level, because regional had failed, something that was really notable was that however this network interact with my data, they were incredibly scared of two entitoes only: the Royal Household and the ICC.  
I'm going to clarify now that they were not scared of any other government or professional body, although with mild discomfort at the ICO.  

This does mean that they were not scared of the Cabinet or the Prime Minister.  

Not then, anyway. Not at that point. things seem a lot more squirmy, now.

[Thiel getting the scrutiny he deserves, is not unwelcome.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPEgcAw/)  

I appreciate that focusing on women and children in the Epstein files, but it's not completely ridiculous to question that if that market was there, that wouldn't there also be a market for young boys, and I appreciate that something that we are all deeply uncomfortable with, but we see it in institutional abuse so why wouldn't it have a modern day equivalent?  

It should be as unacceptable to rape boys as it is unacceptable to rape girls, and is unacceptable to rape men as it is to rape women.  

It is the act of violence that I have a problem with.  

The idea that all of this technology and surveillance industry exists, but we can't solve missing persons cases and we can't protect people? It doesn't really add up.

[Given how the parent company operates, this is not a small series of acts to take, and it is proof that even at a high level you can refuse to work with these people.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPEKtgB/)  

This doesn't mean that the supply chain is perfect in every way, but it does mean that there were certain red lines put up, and that even at the high-level it was possible to avoid this person.

[Don't worry the antifascists have got this.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPEVsr7/)  

One of my favourite things about watching this whole charade, if you can say that there is a favourite thing in watching the alt right attempt to gain power...  

Matt Goodwin clearly thought that he could rise a power on the basis of his knowledge of the alt right through history, but unfortunately the man has all the personality of a slightly damp sock they got stuck to the peeling wallpaper at the back of a radiator, so it's not going exactly as intended.  
[We are very interested in this apparently, in our little centroid.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPE4JyE/)  

It does appear that GMP have made a really interesting decision in terms of how to put up that line of officers.  

Not equipping with shields and having visors up, is already interesting security stance, which is attempting to give some protection, without completely rolling out deescalation.  

(When you've got shields and batons, you've ruled out the escalation.)  

Given the historic positioning of GMP, this is actually a really interesting operational change.  

As the antifascists are usually a collection of all of the "too woke", "lefty" groups, and given the previous prevalence of alternatives to standard conservative politics and policing, just because you will see that after austerity and in a profession that tends to lend itself to respect respect for a system of authority, it's incredibly interesting that therapy is to be a less aggressive physical stance by the police.  

This is interesting because it's suggests that synthesis of intelligence has changed.  

And Greater Manchester tend to be quite Metropolitan police like in their stance.  

The fact that this is timed with the investigations into serious misconduct in public office, should probably put our brain cells into gear on who might have been advocating for the prescription of a particular group.  

Especially seeing us, given the loyalty that will tend to run between policing and protection of veterans, having two police that, would have required a significant amount of "additional information" which appeared to support that prescription and actually have it been enforced that aggressively.  

This is a significant change in who is being given weight to their knowledge provision and information sharing.  

It's subtle, perhaps, but this is huge.  

I am not unaware of how this changes the interpretation of my own arrest; the line of questioning was very peculiar.
