Given the number of people who were international pride and relations who are impact files, and two investigations into serious misconduct in public office, does anyone like to ask the question about whether or not part of Britain's power is provision of human resource? It's not like we haven't done this before. It's not as other countries don't do it more often than we do.

This is why we need to stop having carveouts for national security, Royal Family, or counterterrorism.  

We can't keep putting key infrastructure car out, we can't keep carving out something that people can hide behind.  

Every time we carve out law, what we are doing is admitting to ourselves that we know that there is something going on that we wouldn't want the public to know about.  

Whether that's a minor embarrassment, or it's an international trade which is grossly illegal, it doesn't matter.  
As long as the harm continues, the public is still going to feel it, they just won't necessarily have the words to put to the issue, but they'll still be angry.  

If you really want the British public to not be angry, we probably need to stay away from things like modern slavery and human trafficking.

So is the reason that you don't like him, and probably set up the whistleblowing, because he has opinions like, "maybe the Middle East should decide his own future"?  

Or is it genuinely just because he can write for more than one sentence and actually sounds like he knows anything at all?  

I think it's been very clear that you are a rote learner, and it literally goes in one year and out the other, just stays in long enough for the exam.  

There's a very little depth of understanding.

[Why are you so bothered about the search being conducted at that property?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPEo8dM/)  

Do we need to watch *every* single video?  

What is it that concerns you?  

It is not possible to carve out "privacy", when there is a criminal investigation ongoing.  

& yes, we're looking at documents and devices, but we're also putting police in a place where if they do see anything that's obviously immoral or illegal, depending on what they find, that may be included as part of the investigation.  

To use the classical example that we all usually use, if the police stumbled on a load of weed or cocaine, they don't need you just leave it there.  

that's not to say that any of that actually existed at that property, it's just to say that if it did, it would be picked up. Because of the amount of gifts that you can get from being a trade envoy, it wouldn't be completely irrational to be taking actual goods as well.  

[I mean the answer to this whole discussion about the Epstein files and what they were up to, is that they were up to crimes against humanity, and being disgusting.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPE7Ajv/)  

Whenever I hear discussion about this, it's not that hard to look at Regis even in the last hundred years and pick out so many of the things that other regimes have done and look at this and go, "yeah, that tracks".  

These women who are obsessed with control, obsessed with having access to children and young women and young boys, and where and are willing to leverage huge amount amounts of power for their own selfish goals.  

The only thing that is complicated about this, is the difficulty of getting them tried and conflicted now, but a really good way to start that would be to fulfil the US law that requires full disclosure of the files.  
Bear in mind that these are the same people who have done the most to undermine and the road international humanitarian law, and undermine the ICJ.  

They understood that they could go to the Hague.
