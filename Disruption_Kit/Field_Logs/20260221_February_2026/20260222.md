Given the number of people who were international pride and relations who are impact files, and two investigations into serious misconduct in public office, does anyone like to ask the question about whether or not part of Britain's power is provision of human resource? It's not like we haven't done this before. It's not as other countries don't do it more often than we do.  

[This has the capacity to impact the defence sector on an international basis, particularly in terms of whether or not there was appropriate action taken when wrongdoing was known.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRPEGNbF/)  

This is why we need to stop having carveouts for national security, Royal Family, or counterterrorism.  

We can't keep putting key infrastructure car out, we can't keep carving out something that people can hide behind.  

Every time we carve out law, what we are doing is admitting to ourselves that we know that there is something going on that we wouldn't want the public to know about.  

Whether that's a minor embarrassment, or it's an international trade which is grossly illegal, it doesn't matter.  
As long as the harm continues, the public is still going to feel it, they just won't necessarily have the words to put to the Durango, but they'll still be angry.  

If you really want the British public to not be angry, we probably need to stay away from things like modern slavery and human trafficking.
