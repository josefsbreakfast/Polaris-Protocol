[This](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqxdg01w4rno) is interesting, and peak "where Lib Dems can be very effective as Parliamentary scrutiny".  

Although I'm unclear if (and why if) only the first year?  

Unless this is to reasonably avoid any policing investigation, in which case pushing for anything you feel may be useful is more effective, as it would flag to oversight. The timing of the Coalition Cabinet is not unnoted, when one looks at dates; it would be in party interest to not appear *selective*, when we press for transparency.   

[Hmm.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/23/peter-mandelson-arrested-on-suspicion-of-misconduct-in-public-office) Precisely why are we all being weirdly protective of the 2010 Coalition years?  

"Full transparency, but only if its Labour", doesn't actually help Epstein survivors on the whole gain transparency, nor does it help actually solve the root causes of grooming gangs in the UK.  

(No, racist white men, it is not exclusively melaninated men. That's your weird obsession, no one else's.)  

The Rupert Lowe interview by Emily Maitis btw? Gold star, and the comments are less sock-puppety/united in racism than usual. Curious.

[Omfg could the owners of GB News call for US annexation of the UK any more loudly?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5STPcb/)  

Does anyone who is listening to this, actually give a fuck about these islands for any other reason that we're being told to be angry, and also did you know they existed before this, and also do you realise that what we are being asked to do here is a huge expense to the UK taxpayer going forward, and also it is only beneficial to the United States and no one else?  

That's slightly oversimplifying it sure, but this is already an ICJ decided issue.  

The deal as it was has already been agreed, and Trump has only kicked off when he isn't getting his own way on something completely separate, and also can we just all remember:  

Donald Trump still has not faced any legal scrutiny for credible accusations of quite serious sexual violence towards children.  

The administration backing him up, are genuinely not operating on the same consensus reality you and I are, and literally believe in getting all the Jewish people in the world putting them in Israel, starting a war with Iran, and then blowing us all up.  

If you want to support the world's most antisemitic government currently, be my fucking guest, but don't say I didn't warn you that it was a stupid idea and it was essentially treacherous to the UK interest.  

It's interesting that they're no longer confident to have white men say it on TV. That should tell you how this is going.  

Unfortunately, we see a lot of editorial decisions like this, and it's something that at several political parties do as well; we can't keep pretending that we are not an inherently racist country, because there is something at our elite level, which essentially chooses to keep plugging a form of racism whilst it may be difficult for white people to see at first glance, it is deeply harmful, tokenistic, and if nothing else insulting to the public.  

I also don't need this much of this news channel in my feed, but to comment on [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5SoXqM/): I keep telling everyone that racists are not very creative, and again I can't really help the fact that after using words like globalist on your channel, frequently and for years, well literally bringing up the murder of Jesus Christ as being rhetoric that we use against people that we want to other... and I'm just saying that as a Jew, I see it, I know what's been done here on a rhetorical level, and I don't care what word we use to describe it, it's not cool.  

I did really enjoy the perhaps unintentional win, of asking a lawyer who primarily deals with migration cases, how much money they're making out of it, like there's some secret multimillion pound industry.  

The only secret multimillion pound industry is the one that makes money out of the process of incarceration, which appears to be unresolved by progressively longer waiting lists for application processing.  

Just as the United States has the prison industrial complex, there is a migration industrial complex in the UK, and the primary beneficiaries are white guys who are already in the UK, or another predominantly white anglophone country.  

There is money being taken out the public purse, and the public bar being exploited in this narrative, but the businesses that are making money, are the ones who are making an industry out of an efficiency problem which can be resolved via better bureaucracy.  

This is also such an aggressive interview, and it actually makes the guy who is being interviewed look a lot better than I think the editors intended.  

Is Steve Bannon officially at GB Mews, or is that just a high degree of political overlap? For a guy who was hanging around Jeffrey Epstein quite a lot, and given GB News apparently having such an interest in reducing violence against women and girls when it is a *foreigner*, I just feel that if there is a pre-existing relationship, we should all be very honest about it and very transparent.  

Just to highlight the UK and Chagos Islands point, because this has been an ICJ case, the reason that we kept our overseas territories primarily, was to support worldwide coverage of the Royal Navy; it literally maps to a circumference plan of the globe. At a time when we were sailing, this would've been very useful and advantageous territorial, but we are not sailing in the same ships that we used to, and quite frankly... the world looks very different now, and we have things called aircraft carriers, and we have refuelling ships.  

It doesn't really make sense to keep hold of land, unless you want to do very specific types of strikes, which are generally not the types of strikes that the UK admits to leading in.  

I'm just saying: if you want to make this a thing, can you all at least make it make some degree of sense, at least more tactical or operational interview, rather than making it the fuck up?  

Alternatively, we could just release the Epstein files for the survivors, as the deadline for that has now passed in US law, and utilising disaster capitalism and shock doctrine as a way to obscure that, is deeply cruel to those who survived that network.  

It also looks weak as shit, I won't lie.

[All of this, because the BBC is our cultural representative to the world, and the fact that it can bleep out Free Palestine but it can't bleep out one word?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5S3uLM/)  

So many missed opportunities, and the realistic future of our country is closer to countries who are far more affected by this, then it is to the elite white people running the United States at the present time.  

Even if you don't care about how much you offended people, this is literally a problem of mortgage in our future because it makes it slightly more comfortable in the moment right now.  

Given that extrajudicial murders of black people in the United States are even higher than they usually are under the administration, I really would not want to go down this route of appeasing a bunch of fascists. This is making us look bad internationally.  
Some of you really can't imagine even the present world that we are in, whether the major majority of the world is not white. It's okay that majority of the world isn't white. We are excluding ourselves from international trade by being a bunch of pillocks.  

No one should be endorsing apartheid this hard, although that does seem to be one of the BBC's primary hobbies these days, regardless of where the apartheid exists.  

For the BBC to also be claiming that it actually gives a fuck about disability, when it's engaging some of the most dehumanising retro against disabled people for years, is fucking laughable.  

Just handover anyone who knew Savile, and maybe we can start negotiating; I'm sure none of this is a distraction from the fact that Donald Trump still is in breach of the law in the United States by not releasing the files, and is very tenuous in his regime due to the terrorist failure at Supreme Court, and his general inability to get anything done other than tank the US economy for the workers.

[Don't tempt me with a good time; the inquiry needs to be anyone who was connected, that reads like scapegoating, which does not read as transparency in democracy.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/23/inquiry-andrew-links-jeffrey-epstein-matter-for-mps-says-no-10)  

We've moved down the transparency index again, so it would be nice to get ourselves together a little bit more on this.

[What are you going to do about regional accent then, Mr Lowe?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5AfQTx/)  

An interesting little thing about London hospitals in particular, is that sometimes it is genuinely so hard for South to understand very very broad northern and Scottish accents, but assistance is required.  

Which I find fascinating because everybody has adjusted to be able to understand the BBC, so we can either do this by increasing your language diversity, or by backing off translation services, which are already cut to the bone terms of funding.  

I mean, if you personally want to pay more money, for when People only managed to give us indications of their diagnosis late, because they couldn't see a translator, how are you going to justify that funding?  

Furthermore, many people speak English very well, but they code switch into a greater degree of familiarity and intimacy in a different language; we should be happy to receive people in whatever state makes them able to discuss them for the most serious symptoms of their lives, surely if we all cared about men's mental health and men's physical health, we would also support this in heightened state of vulnerability being something that we welcome and tolerate and cater to.  

It's always interesting to me how much men undermine themselves, when they come on different issues like this, arguing that other people should be restrained and put into boxes. It does tell us all quite a lot about how the patriarchy is fundamentally undermining you being yourself.  

also, there is quite a large amount of money that the NHS makes off people flying here to have treatment in this country, because where that fucking good, so does that mean we'd also have to turn away all of that capital?  

Because commonly the translation service is actually end up serving across more than just the private area, so you'd effectively have these translators that you are not doing anything with, because... culture?  

I also have to ask how you feel about Welsh speaking NHS patients, because this is an area of concern in Wales, which is interesting that reform UK when you were in it, was so keen to expand into Wales, if what you're saying is that you don't want to tolerate any language other than English being spoken. There is a huge shortage of Welsh speaking doctors and healthcare staff in the NHS, and it is a huge problem for rural communities in Wales, many of whom fit into the population which presumably Restore Britain or Reform Britain or Reclaim Britain or Reunite Britain or Replant Britain or Replumb Britain or Ecycle Britain or whatever it is that you are all doing over there, would seek to appeal to.  

It just amazes me how loud the contempt for the poor white working class really is, when you listen to some of these people in Reform UK and whatever Rupert Lowe is doing these days.  

The Epstein class was focused on dividing the public and the demos for a reason; we are far easier to control and manipulate when we count back each other up, because we are distracted by some nonsense bullshit that stops us from just not being a dick.  

Di you want to know what is really harming the white working class? It's listening to this lot. They know that what they are doing is a grift. They have made their peace with the fact that it is a grift. We all do some weird jobs for money. The longer we all listen to this and give it our time, the longer it's going to take us to actually fix this place up. Quite honestly, I think the fact that there is poo in our drinking water, is slightly more concerning than anything to do with which languages are being spoken in a GP surgery.  

I also cannot understand why everyone wants to listen to everyone else's conversations. This is really peculiar to me. Why are you that bothered about what somebody else is saying to their relative or to their friend?  

If you actually think about it, and take it out of 9/11 logic, it literally makes no sense and it is weird.  

Moreover, if the white working class actually want to see people who sound and look and come from the same backgrounds as them, in professional jobs like healthcare, you are going to have to allow for DEI initiatives because that is how kids from backgrounds like yours can actually even get close to qualifying in those jobs.  

DEI initiatives are what give the basis for the programs that allow kids from state schools to be able to transfer into places like Cambridge and Oxford.  

If you genuinely give a shit about not having a shitty life, and having your kids grew up in a world that gives them more opportunity, and actually gives some basis or pays the way for them to be judged on their merit and not from their background, you will support DEI initiatives in some form or another. In order to build solidarity across the group of people that we need to build that solidarity with, in order for you to get what you want, you also just need to accept that some of those initiatives are not going to benefit you personally as much as other initiatives. That's fine.  

The enemy of the white working class, is not anyone who is going to be benefiting from a DEI initiative; you are pretending that you are a lot closer to those billionaires than is actually the case. If they wanted to help us or get up the ladder, they would've done it by now.  

But whatever, if you want to be racist so badly that you're willing to sacrifice not only your children's future but also their children's future? You can't expect those other people to help you and stand by your side, when you won't stand with them.  

---

I don't care that it's a very weird way to rationalise to people who are not willing to give up on the fact that they view people differently, we just need to have some common sense right now, and stop seeing us all as potentially being billionaires when that is incredibly unlikely for any of us to ever get into that position.  

This is all rhetoric that protects the Epstein class, literally from some basic accountability for a decades-long child sex trafficking ring.  

I don't know why you're still protecting them.
