[This](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqxdg01w4rno) is interesting, and peak "where Lib Dems can be very effective as Parliamentary scrutiny".  

Although I'm unclear if (and why if) only the first year?  

Unless this is to reasonably avoid any policing investigation, in which case pushing for anything you feel may be useful is more effective, as it would flag to oversight. The timing of the Coalition Cabinet is not unnoted, when one looks at dates; it would be in party interest to not appear *selective*, when we press for transparency.
