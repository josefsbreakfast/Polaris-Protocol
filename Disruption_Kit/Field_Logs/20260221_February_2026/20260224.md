[This](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqxdg01w4rno) is interesting, and peak "where Lib Dems can be very effective as Parliamentary scrutiny".  

Although I'm unclear if (and why if) only the first year?  

Unless this is to reasonably avoid any policing investigation, in which case pushing for anything you feel may be useful is more effective, as it would flag to oversight. The timing of the Coalition Cabinet is not unnoted, when one looks at dates; it would be in party interest to not appear *selective*, when we press for transparency.   

[Hmm.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/23/peter-mandelson-arrested-on-suspicion-of-misconduct-in-public-office) Precisely why are we all being weirdly protective of the 2010 Coalition years?  

"Full transparency, but only if its Labour", doesn't actually help Epstein survivors on the whole gain transparency, nor does it help actually solve the root causes of grooming gangs in the UK.  

(No, racist white men, it is not exclusively melaninated men. That's your weird obsession, no one else's.)  

The Rupert Lowe interview by Emily Maitis btw? Gold star, and the comments are less sock-puppety/united in racism than usual. Curious.

[Omfg could the owners of GB News call for US annexation of the UK any more loudly?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5STPcb/)  

Does anyone who is listening to this, actually give a fuck about these islands for any other reason that we're being told to be angry, and also did you know they existed before this, and also do you realise that what we are being asked to do here is a huge expense to the UK taxpayer going forward, and also it is only beneficial to the United States and no one else?  

That's slightly oversimplifying it sure, but this is already an ICJ decided issue.  

The deal as it was has already been agreed, and Trump has only kicked off when he isn't getting his own way on something completely separate, and also can we just all remember:  

Donald Trump still has not faced any legal scrutiny for credible accusations of quite serious sexual violence towards children.  

The administration backing him up, are genuinely not operating on the same consensus reality you and I are, and literally believe in getting all the Jewish people in the world putting them in Israel, starting a war with Iran, and then blowing us all up.  

If you want to support the world's most antisemitic government currently, be my fucking guest, but don't say I didn't warn you that it was a stupid idea and it was essentially treacherous to the UK interest.  

It's interesting that they're no longer confident to have white men say it on TV. That should tell you how this is going.  

Unfortunately, we see a lot of editorial decisions like this, and it's something that at several political parties do as well; we can't keep pretending that we are not an inherently racist country, because there is something at our elite level, which essentially chooses to keep plugging a form of racism whilst it may be difficult for white people to see at first glance, it is deeply harmful, tokenistic, and if nothing else insulting to the public.  

I also don't need this much of this news channel in my feed, but to comment on [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5SoXqM/): I keep telling everyone that racists are not very creative, and again I can't really help the fact that after using words like globalist on your channel, frequently and for years, well literally bringing up the murder of Jesus Christ as being rhetoric that we use against people that we want to other... and I'm just saying that as a Jew, I see it, I know what's been done here on a rhetorical level, and I don't care what word we use to describe it, it's not cool.  

I did really enjoy the perhaps unintentional win, of asking a lawyer who primarily deals with migration cases, how much money they're making out of it, like there's some secret multimillion pound industry.  

The only secret multimillion pound industry is the one that makes money out of the process of incarceration, which appears to be unresolved by progressively longer waiting lists for application processing.  

Just as the United States has the prison industrial complex, there is a migration industrial complex in the UK, and the primary beneficiaries are white guys who are already in the UK, or another predominantly white anglophone country.  

There is money being taken out the public purse, and the public bar being exploited in this narrative, but the businesses that are making money, are the ones who are making an industry out of an efficiency problem which can be resolved via better bureaucracy.  

This is also such an aggressive interview, and it actually makes the guy who is being interviewed look a lot better than I think the editors intended.  

Is Steve Bannon officially at GB Mews, or is that just a high degree of political overlap? For a guy who was hanging around Jeffrey Epstein quite a lot, and given GB News apparently having such an interest in reducing violence against women and girls when it is a *foreigner*, I just feel that if there is a pre-existing relationship, we should all be very honest about it and very transparent.  

Just to highlight the UK and Chagos Islands point, because this has been an ICJ case, the reason that we kept our overseas territories primarily, was to support worldwide coverage of the Royal Navy; it literally maps to a circumference plan of the globe. At a time when we were sailing, this would've been very useful and advantageous territorial, but we are not sailing in the same ships that we used to, and quite frankly... the world looks very different now, and we have things called aircraft carriers, and we have refuelling ships.  

It doesn't really make sense to keep hold of land, unless you want to do very specific types of strikes, which are generally not the types of strikes that the UK admits to leading in.  

I'm just saying: if you want to make this a thing, can you all at least make it make some degree of sense, at least more tactical or operational interview, rather than making it the fuck up?  

Alternatively, we could just release the Epstein files for the survivors, as the deadline for that has now passed in US law, and utilising disaster capitalism and shock doctrine as a way to obscure that, is deeply cruel to those who survived that network.  

It also looks weak as shit, I won't lie.

[All of this, because the BBC is our cultural representative to the world, and the fact that it can bleep out Free Palestine but it can't bleep out one word?](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5S3uLM/)  

So many missed opportunities, and the realistic future of our country is closer to countries who are far more affected by this, then it is to the elite white people running the United States at the present time.  

Even if you don't care about how much you offended people, this is literally a problem of mortgage in our future because it makes it slightly more comfortable in the moment right now.  

Given that extrajudicial murders of black people in the United States are even higher than they usually are under the administration, I really would not want to go down this route of appeasing a bunch of fascists. This is making us look bad internationally.  
Some of you really can't imagine even the present world that we are in, whether the major majority of the world is not white. It's okay that majority of the world isn't white. We are excluding ourselves from international trade by being a bunch of pillocks.  

No one should be endorsing apartheid this hard, although that does seem to be one of the BBC's primary hobbies these days, regardless of where the apartheid exists.  

For the BBC to also be claiming that it actually gives a fuck about disability, when it's engaging some of the most dehumanising retro against disabled people for years, is fucking laughable.  

Just handover anyone who knew Savile, and maybe we can start negotiating; I'm sure none of this is a distraction from the fact that Donald Trump still is in breach of the law in the United States by not releasing the files, and is very tenuous in his regime due to the terrorist failure at Supreme Court, and his general inability to get anything done other than tank the US economy for the workers.
