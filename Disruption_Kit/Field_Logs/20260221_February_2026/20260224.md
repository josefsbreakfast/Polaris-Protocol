[This](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqxdg01w4rno) is interesting, and peak "where Lib Dems can be very effective as Parliamentary scrutiny".  

Although I'm unclear if (and why if) only the first year?  

Unless this is to reasonably avoid any policing investigation, in which case pushing for anything you feel may be useful is more effective, as it would flag to oversight. The timing of the Coalition Cabinet is not unnoted, when one looks at dates; it would be in party interest to not appear *selective*, when we press for transparency.   

[Hmm.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/23/peter-mandelson-arrested-on-suspicion-of-misconduct-in-public-office) Precisely why are we all being weirdly protective of the 2010 Coalition years?  

"Full transparency, but only if its Labour", doesn't actually help Epstein survivors on the whole gain transparency, nor does it help actually solve the root causes of grooming gangs in the UK.  

(No, racist white men, it is not exclusively melaninated men. That's your weird obsession, no one else's.)  

The Rupert Lowe interview by Emily Maitis btw? Gold star, and the comments are less sock-puppety/united in racism than usual. Curious.
