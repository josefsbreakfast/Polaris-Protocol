[I didn't think a lot of people understand how watching three years of back to back vicarious trauma screen directly in front of your face really changed a lot of voters.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRae7sfK/)  

I appreciate it's been a huge effort to try and bring more people out of the algorithmic placement now, but I honestly wouldn't expect to have to watch something the Holocaust happen screened directly to my phone, be confronted with it whenever I go online, told her I can't talk about it, and then expect to vote for a party that was okay with that being my experience in my own country.  

I'm not at home secretary's biggest fan, but I don't think enough people in mainstream policy are really understanding the reality of what a lot of of us sat through; our digital experience with entirely different to yours, and if you honestly can't see how that would make a difference to someone's well-being or how they would vote, I'm not really sure if this is something that can be caught up on. This isn't something which needs to be understood an intellectual level only, it needs to be understood on an emotional level. If the parties People drifted away from a really serious about regaining their ground, I'm sure that's probably the same kind of experience that's being felt for people who voted perhaps differently and I would when they feel dissaffected. Managing a political policy is not exactly the same as putting out different players for a different match, and it just feels sometimes that's what we're watching from whoever is doing the very central organising of seats, here.  
The problem will essentially not be solved for as long as the centrist part the labour party and the commentators around it, refused to recognise that for some people the labour party does not look like a workers party anymore and it does not look like a progressive party or a leftist party anymore; this may not be your personal experience, but the experience of many people is that it's not that anymore. This is one of those things that happens when you start taking larger cash donations, and as a managerial move that's neither good or bad, but that does need to be some honesty about it, and it needs to be some management of expectations. You can't realistically take money from donor, consistently make policy for donor only, and then wonder why the workers are not voting for you. It's just not really that sensible.  
it's quite interesting man to see leftist parties People bought up as the reason that labour lost votes, on previous to this labour has been consistently positioning itself as needing to win back reform voters. It's just quite confusing, and I'm not sure if that's because different approaches are being tried, especially with the turnover of who's being involved, but from work as this is not a party that they can necessarily go to in the same way that they used to. It feels like "workers party but with significant compromises for the bosses", and for a lot of people who always voted labour, because of the reasons they all voted labour, that doesn't sit right emotionally.  

The issue of visas is not unrelated to how we treat people internationally, and our potential complicity in war crimes; this did not start under the starmer government, it started really under the blair government. If you're going to make a party that focuses more on donors, that's absolutely fine, but you can't expect to count on the same loyal support of the workers as you would've had previously.  

Labour needs to decide what it is.  

[we do know who you are most likely have taken donations or gifts in kind from. It is blaringly obvious.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRaeTKww/)  

on the matter of international humanitarian law, both the two parties of traditional politics have lost Lotus from this; if neither of you are picking it up on analytics, it's because the analytics are not reflecting it. Unfortunately, when a lot of those same companies have a vested interest in keeping that deregulated economy present, in particular as an industry, that is going to surface on algorithms whether you like it or not. Again, this is a data infrastructure issue, it's just how the data exists in the theoretical space that it's in; it is incredibly difficult to program out something but the system analysing the data will recognise as a pattern of reality, and this error will become greater than more advanced the system is, and the greater its capacity for data analysis.

As #QuitGPT goes viral, essentially because most people react with dusguist and anger to other guman beings being harmed, the need to review our relationships with AI, big tech, and technofeudalism entrench further.

[Good news: I am going to be intolerable today.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cp8rjk02r0jt)  

This is being written up as the future of potentially being so unstable, and I understand that that's the markets take, and that would be your take if you're looking primarily at a private portfolio. However, the local people in a constituency where there is palpable exhaustion, when they have felt the effects every year since the crash, and so many people are in survival mode (although it is true, half of the constituency has a highest standard of living; not everyone in every area is all in the same boat), just made a Democratic choice to choose something other than their problems being solved primarily through hatred, and they chose a politician with a hopeful but realistic message.  

This is not a bad thing.  

(Is it hilarious that a place with a regional accent and without a bunch of Oxford in Cambridge degrees, made the sensible choice early? I don't not love this.)  

The reason why this party and this candidate won, are less to do with the reasons that a lot of people would like politics to succeed on, but instead this election win was the result of proper planning, enthusiastic execution, and the hard work of people and all sorts of walks of life when it came down to it.  

In essence, the result of the election had a lot more to do with resonating with how people on the ground felt, and with who they fundamentally were, and by promising them something better, than it had to do about any amount of capital spend, budget, or shiny suit.  

And now, Hannah Spencer gets four years to impress them or be strongly contested - that's how this works.  

If you talk about young people and about the poor having drive and having ambition, you cannot do anything but applauded this win, because this was some very ordinary people in a very ordinary area choosing a candidate who they felt really represented them, who again it's hard-working, professional, but also relatable.  

Performative authenticity started to decline in value in online content a couple of years ago, so respectfully, politics did have a good few years had to start to be able to plan around that.  

(I am so smug about everything in this win; again, I will be absolutely intolerable.)
