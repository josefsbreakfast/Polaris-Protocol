[I didn't think a lot of people understand how watching three years of back to back vicarious trauma screen directly in front of your face really changed a lot of voters.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRae7sfK/)  

I appreciate it's been a huge effort to try and bring more people out of the algorithmic placement now, but I honestly wouldn't expect to have to watch something the Holocaust happen screened directly to my phone, be confronted with it whenever I go online, told her I can't talk about it, and then expect to vote for a party that was okay with that being my experience in my own country.  

I'm not at home secretary's biggest fan, but I don't think enough people in mainstream policy are really understanding the reality of what a lot of of us sat through; our digital experience with entirely different to yours, and if you honestly can't see how that would make a difference to someone's well-being or how they would vote, I'm not really sure if this is something that can be caught up on. This isn't something which needs to be understood an intellectual level only, it needs to be understood on an emotional level. If the parties People drifted away from a really serious about regaining their ground, I'm sure that's probably the same kind of experience that's being felt for people who voted perhaps differently and I would when they feel dissaffected. Managing a political policy is not exactly the same as putting out different players for a different match, and it just feels sometimes that's what we're watching from whoever is doing the very central organising of seats, here.  
The problem will essentially not be solved for as long as the centrist part the labour party and the commentators around it, refused to recognise that for some people the labour party does not look like a workers party anymore and it does not look like a progressive party or a leftist party anymore; this may not be your personal experience, but the experience of many people is that it's not that anymore. This is one of those things that happens when you start taking larger cash donations, and as a managerial move that's neither good or bad, but that does need to be some honesty about it, and it needs to be some management of expectations. You can't realistically take money from donor, consistently make policy for donor only, and then wonder why the workers are not voting for you. It's just not really that sensible.  
it's quite interesting man to see leftist parties People bought up as the reason that labour lost votes, on previous to this labour has been consistently positioning itself as needing to win back reform voters. It's just quite confusing, and I'm not sure if that's because different approaches are being tried, especially with the turnover of who's being involved, but from work as this is not a party that they can necessarily go to in the same way that they used to. It feels like "workers party but with significant compromises for the bosses", and for a lot of people who always voted labour, because of the reasons they all voted labour, that doesn't sit right emotionally.  

The issue of visas is not unrelated to how we treat people internationally, and our potential complicity in war crimes; this did not start under the starmer government, it started really under the blair government. If you're going to make a party that focuses more on donors, that's absolutely fine, but you can't expect to count on the same loyal support of the workers as you would've had previously.  

Labour needs to decide what it is.

on the matter of international humanitarian law, both the two parties of traditional politics have lost Lotus from this; if neither of you are picking it up on analytics, it's because the analytics are not reflecting it. Unfortunately, when a lot of those same companies have a vested interest in keeping that deregulated economy present, in particular as an industry, that is going to surface on algorithms whether you like it or not. Again, this is a data infrastructure issue, it's just how the data exists in the theoretical space that it's in; it is incredibly difficult to program out something but the system analysing the data will recognise as a pattern of reality, and this error will become greater than more advanced the system is, and the greater its capacity for data analysis.

As #QuitGPT goes viral, essentially because most people react with dusguist and anger to other guman beings being harmed, the need to review our relationships with AI, big tech, and technofeudalism entrench further.
