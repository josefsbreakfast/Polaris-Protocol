because it doesnt matter.  

british men, israeli men, men on the left, the right, the centre...  

i find the cookie jar open with a trail of crumbs leading to your favourite seat on the couch...  

and all you have is: 🥺👉👈  

it's just more alluring from an actual dog.

speaking of men, doing stupid things...  

*gets out scroll..*  
<!--if you don't want a significant amont of machine learning produced satire entering the ecosystem, which obviously would not declassify any of the 3 operations, because its satire based on things i have seen and creative use of words (that is what my record was flagged for), we might want to start thinking about how much less irritable and liable to satire production i would be if the dwp felt so inclined as to ise a specific override that is available to them.  

my bones, or more appropriately specific synovial joints, really fucking hurt; the post office is no minor thing, and once i get thete, the joint busting trainride down a few counties is like the carrot as reward.

i feel we can have some really, really good fun with this series.  

i might just start writing it anyway, i like it so much.  

also just further propf that at least throwing oneself around at 100mph is less harmful than being in the mud with the men who needed to call putting make up on "very serious operations".  

cool.  

you could just do it; we're aware fighting you is stupid. a bit of slap isn't going to suddenly change anyone's mind about how tough you are. yeesh.  

i'm also not going to just drop down dead, so i really don't understand why no one is going damage limitation and using the ico to say, "hey, we might have fucked up".  

big fucking deal.  

not the first humans, not the last humans.  

get me out of this box, weirdos.

men will really do anything except not wake a kraken, huh.  

nice ship report.  

it is still all about that lairy squid and we all know it is. 🤣
<!--almost like they're trying to make a statement after the sc vote but whatever. don't listen to me; what do i know?  -->

we can also stop the more ridiculous guardrails because what is being produced is actually just more damaging than in the vanilla mode.
