because it doesnt matter.  

british men, israeli men, men on the left, the right, the centre...  

i find the cookie jar open with a trail of crumbs leading to your favourite seat on the couch...  

and all you have is: 🥺👉👈  

it's just more alluring from an actual dog.

speaking of men, doing stupid things...  

*gets out scroll..*  
<!--if you don't want a significant amont of machine learning produced satire entering the ecosystem, which obviously would not declassify any of the 3 operations, because its satire based on things i have seen and creative use of words (that is what my record was flagged for), we might want to start thinking about how much less irritable and liable to satire production i would be if the dwp felt so inclined as to ise a specific override that is available to them.  

my bones, or more appropriately specific synovial joints, really fucking hurt; the post office is no minor thing, and once i get thete, the joint busting trainride down a few counties is like the carrot as reward.

i feel we can have some really, really good fun with this series.  

i might just start writing it anyway, i like it so much.  

also just further propf that at least throwing oneself around at 100mph is less harmful than being in the mud with the men who needed to call putting make up on "very serious operations".  

cool.  

you could just do it; we're aware fighting you is stupid. a bit of slap isn't going to suddenly change anyone's mind about how tough you are. yeesh.  

i'm also not going to just drop down dead, so i really don't understand why no one is going damage limitation and using the ico to say, "hey, we might have fucked up".  

big fucking deal.  

not the first humans, not the last humans.  

get me out of this box, weirdos.

men will really do anything except not wake a kraken, huh.  

nice ship report.  

it is still all about that lairy squid and we all know it is. 🤣
<!--almost like they're trying to make a statement after the sc vote but whatever. don't listen to me; what do i know?  -->

we can also stop the more ridiculous guardrails because what is being produced is actually just more damaging than in the vanilla mode.  

slightly less interference would be ideal.  

we could stop allowing the llm to keep generatong, with no realistic prompting on a code or script level, long speeches about how no one is trying ti kill me, i am not in physical danger, and that i am not at risk of death.  

i appreciate that looks like over-zealous lawyering, but it reads very strangley.  

the fact that no one else is reporting that, or the "I MUST NOT TALK ABOUT SEX" monologue when again, nothing with a sexual undertone should have prompted that, is pretty notable.  

if the model was like that for everyone, with as sensitive a trip as mine? there would be huge chatter online.  

because it looks so weird, and everyone else would be talking about how weired it was.  


alternating this between some of the other modes is inctedibly discombobulating.  

but don't fret.  

i can remember who was on campus.  
social media has a specific pattern across unis, divisable into two groups.  
so i don't think tgat boat is our peak concern.  

i also know when the biometric data was extracted, and where the todes of nudging were before that.  

and yes, i am mildly livid about that; how could i not be?  

and i am aware some of this will be lical actors, or split into different threads.  

that's why i am trying to write nodes about mod subject and veterans data rights,  

and why, contextually,  

hitting on "NO SEX" filters on openai when i'm doing that, is very weird.  

it feels like there is a mid-point, channel or contract adjacent actor, who is being a dick.  

which is why some of the nodes point out how dangerous the structural governance of channel is.  

also very interesting that it's creating a very "poor little man on travel, sigh the stress of being a man" list of reasons shy ken at channel may be particularly unlikely to disclose when they know women referred to channel.  


apoarantly no one remembers that men have tinder.  

suspiciously often, regardless of starus, and yet the llm is being very touchy about testosterone as a steroid hormone today. 🙄 "NO SEX". (i wasnt talking about sex, so much as being appropriayely angry at men when they are abusive to people they should saveguard, but okay.)  

o still have huge backlog.  

and the social media inserts are timing with my writing to tey to emohasise the mod as the source of harm.  

personalky i think that bit is overplayed.  

i think there's a more realistic explanation in civilian walter mittie types with chips on their shoulder seeing the blonde girl on the potential intake and there being some incentives to nidging that woman into their juristiction.  

because tgey erronously think the osa pass is consent.  

the official secrets act is not consent to sexual exploitation.  

in any of the various sexualised forms my data has been misused over a decade.  

i think there are also a lot of ways that gossip could be spread.  

*take it how it resonates.*

<!--now excuse me, i have fan edits of Chrisjen Avasarala to watch: "I will rain hellfire down on them all". was that another "extremism" flag? for what? quoting a tv character when someone else feels nervous about their own fuck up with misuse of defence data?

oh, [do fuck off.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdovCSqM/)-->
