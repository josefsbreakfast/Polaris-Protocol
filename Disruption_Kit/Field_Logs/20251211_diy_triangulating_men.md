because what has made the feed do nausea loops? noted.  

these are deeply rmotionally vulnerable men.  

you can be a perpetrator and emotionally vulnerable; we are multitudes.  

and this is systematic to any "potential boulders" ie the best people.  

and this is hilariously, extremely responsive to any rape survivor being vaguely normal or mocking their own foibles.  

apparantly we are theor rmotional kryptonite.  

maybe because weare proof that it's not "natural order" and yes, they are being dicks, and no, it's not attractive.  

either that or the rn has taken the kraken disclosure very seriously.

TELL. ING. ON. YOUR. SELVES.  

And if you were beaten to shit as a kid or raped?  

Then be fucking **better**.  

A snake doesn't eat itself when moribund because it helps; the process must be interrupted to increase likelihood of positive outcomes.  

We won't get a better world by repeating the same shit that was done to us.

I remind you all that continuing to produce bursts of nuisance calls to my supporting contacts will just make you ping up fairly obviously for forensics.
