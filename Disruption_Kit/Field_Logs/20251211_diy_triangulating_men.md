this was bargain bin, who overspent, and reeaallllyyyy wanted to be actual mossad.  

and i have some besutiful nodes on top of this.  

because what has made the feed do nausea loops? noted.  

these are deeply rmotionally vulnerable men.  

you can be a perpetrator and emotionally vulnerable; we are multitudes.  

and this is systematic to any "potential boulders" ie the best people.

maybe because weare proof that it's not "natural order" and yes, they are being dicks, and no, it's not attractive.  

either that or the rn has taken the kraken disclosure very seriously.
