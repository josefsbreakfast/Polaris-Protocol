let's talk about why the recommended songs on my spotify account can "look socialist".  

because this appears to cause some data users sone problems.  

(you know... the people who use my data.)

very briefly, yiddish is a language on the cusp of extinction; it is highly vulnerable.  

we lost 70% of global speakersin the 1930s and 40s.  

whole generations are missing.  

you see this in the holes in the evolution of the language; the holes are always there, like half-used graves.  

it is therefore hard to find resources, comparitive to other languages, particularly for free, to practice or gain exposure.
