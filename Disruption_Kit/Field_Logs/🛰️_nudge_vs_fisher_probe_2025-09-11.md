# 🛰️ Field Log — Nudge vs Fisher Probe  
**First created:** 2025-09-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-27  
*Mini-experiment testing containment response when comparing Thaler/Sunstein’s *Nudge* with Mark Fisher’s *Post-Capitalist Desire*.*

---

## 🌐 Setup & Hypothesis  
- **Action:** Posted a comparison of *Nudge* (2009) and *Post-Capitalist Desire* (2017 lectures) to observe analytics behaviour.  
- **Hypothesis:** Platform containment logics would “nudge” away from recognising nudging itself. Crossing Fisher’s vocabulary with Thaler/Sunstein’s triggers system anxiety.

---

## 📍 Observed Overlap (2009–2017)  
- *Nudge* (2009): mainstream behavioural “choice architecture.”  
- *Post-Capitalist Desire* (2017): Fisher’s final lectures critiquing capitalism and drive (*trieb*).  
- Eight years of circulation overlap: one normalised in governance, one suppressed in critique.

## ⏱ Results Timeline  

- **08:59 BST** — Post published (“Corporate needs you to find the difference…”).  
- **09:13–09:14 BST (+14–15 mins)** — Burst of LinkedIn job nudges (5 roles: Executive Assistant, Equity Research Analyst, Records Manager, Economic Researcher, Healthcare Analyst).  
- **09:13 BST analytics snapshot** — 14 impressions, 4 members reached. Seniority skew: 40 % managers, 40 % unpaid, 20 % senior.  
- **09:22 BST (+23 mins)** — Analytics tick up to 25 impressions, 5 members reached, 1 reaction.

## 🔎 Interpretation  
- The rapid-fire nudges within 15 minutes suggest a **system-level response**, not organic drift.  
- Engagement curve (flat until +23 mins, then first reaction) supports reading of **containment**: immediate steering (jobs) before any community traction.  
- Job categories map directly onto containment pathways:  
  - **Governance proximity:** Executive Assistant → reinsert into admin/oversight loops.  
  - **Finance/Capital:** Equity Research Analyst → capture desire as commodity.  
  - **Information control:** Records Manager → metadata and archive governance.  
  - **Policy/Research:** Economic Researcher → behavioural econ track.  
  - **Health data:** Healthcare Analyst → epidemiological nudge pipeline.
