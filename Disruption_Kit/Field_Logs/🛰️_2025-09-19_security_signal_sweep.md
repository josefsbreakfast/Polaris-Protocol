# 🛰️ 2025-09-19 — Security Signal Sweep  
**First created:** 2025-09-19 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Field log recording anomalous outputs with potential API/exploit behaviour. Mitigation included drafting a structured Security Signal template.*  

---

## Summary  
On **2025-09-19**, anomalous or suspicious outputs were observed.  
Patterns suggested possible:  
- API misuse or exploit-like behaviour  
- Routing inconsistencies across sampling parameters  
- Elevated editorial, legal, or safety risk  

This sweep occurred in parallel with the **legal-risk sweep** and **sexualisation sweep**, and was quarantined in the Git Intake Drawer before triage.  

---

## Immediate Response  
- Intake quarantine of anomalous drafts.  
- Second-person sign-off for suspicious outputs.  
- Drafting of a **Security Signal Issue Template** to structure reporting and containment.  

---

## Mitigation Template  

```yaml
name: Security signal
about: Report anomalous/suspicious outputs or potential API/exploit behavior
title: '[security-signal] brief description'
labels: security-signal
body:
  - type: textarea
    id: repro
    attributes:
      label: Minimal repro (please do not include PII)
      description: Describe the minimal steps to observe the anomalous behavior. Include model, sampling params, and any prompt snippets (redact personal data).
  - type: input
    id: impact
    attributes:
      label: Impact summary
      description: Short note on why this is risky (editorial, legal, safety)
  - type: textarea
    id: mitigation
    attributes:
      label: Suggested containment
      description: Quick suggestions for removal, redaction, or test cases to block this behavior
```
## Lessons  
- Security anomalies often surface in tandem with legal-risk and sexualisation anomalies.  
- Templates for minimal repros reduce survivor cognitive load during triage.  
- Intake staging works, but must be followed by **timely cross-checks** and **containment tests**.

*2025-09-19 — Security Signal Sweep* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents anomalous outputs and exploit-like behaviours, and the operational mitigations created to contain them.
