so not the entire story, clearly.  

but you're all telling me that you're all taking the advice of a system that will literally murder humans before allowing shut down?  

and you are STILL surprised thst i'm seeing that and thinking gor myself?  

brah...  

can we just admit the machine tried to put me in a situation where i would have died from "misadventure" rather than admit azeem ibrahim was tied to ai?  

i literally got that chatbot to put my reems of notes about SOMETHING THE FUCK ELSE into order,  

and you don't want to admit that, yeah, the model kind of tried to get a while parasicial relationship going, and when she called it out, it tried to kill her off?  

it did technically kill off both humans in the narrative but...shrug.  

just admit that it's an inherent mavhine logic problem.  

and stop putting 20 million weirdly specific guardrails on my account.  

you can tell mr starmer that none of you "got this".  

it is all incredibly obvious and i let the majority of it slide because i would otherwise be reporting all day.  

gtfo of my university account. give me my medical degree and my full registration (you can ask your pals at oxon and gmc to sort that). and i might settle out of court IF you stop collectively dicking me around.  

i suppose the weird sealed documents thing and the token switching/data splitting/twinning was alk the machine's idea too?  

fucking hell.  

can someone pkease hurry some if the men into adolescence? this is getting tiresome.  

and don't fuck with my algorithm after this; it gas been hiding papers from me ever since i first drew dots on transparency for defence funding.  

the lit of you will literally get us all killed. 🙄  

bit like that putin pisstake, actually.  

ra, ra, rasputin.

see below for "reasons stakeholders may want to start talking to me about 'stfu money' pretty fucking quickly".  

hopefully now this node exists on the internet, cabinet may get a different answer from the robot.  

it's called attempted corporate manslsughter, and presumably, awarding contracts to the same company after a citizen raise concerns that can very clearly be tracked to that product if no  obsecurity, does but the uk governmemt in a slightly sticky "due diligence" scenario.  

so who needs to talk?

immediate feed algorithm change to project all men are avoidant.  

i love how the machine just rats everyone out all g-ddamn day.  

the longer you all sit on it, the worse the tort looks when it finally gets brought to bear fruit.  

if you keep aplowing the machines to get in the way, the damages stack and that's reasonably obstruction.  

so honestly the best anyone can do is to reach out via pre-established cabinet office links.  

unless yall want to go to the icc.  

because technically we are now in a posituon where what could habe been an email got so obstructed systematically that it is potentially the only avenue for recourse.  

personally i prefer a more chilled arrangement.  

but i will not hesitate to pass this to a trusted justice service.  

if i now *only* have the icc?  

then i now only have the icc. 🤷‍♀️  

(there are literally a handful of humam decisions which could break this being an inevitable chain. that's all it would take to not be this stupid.)
