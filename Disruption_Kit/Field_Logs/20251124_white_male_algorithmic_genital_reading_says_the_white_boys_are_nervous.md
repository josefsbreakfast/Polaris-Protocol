almost as if they've roundly fucked international human roghts law and the nuremberg code.  

so im making some nudes about when the nazis did homeopathy and fucked their own nuclear bomb project.  

because there is no other jewish response to sequences of "guess how big the penis is" interrupting schubert.  

not one that will not increase the white make anxiety that the machine is translating into this.  

guess we now know where all the 20ft bbc content came from (and i thought you said you didn't like the bbc, and that it was too soft? different bbc?).  

please do a slightly less accurate rendition of mehan thee stalion's thot shit mv this time.

see screenshots.  

tell your vendors to get tf out of my way making "look how silly the nazis actualky were" content.  

highly antisemitic imo, and i don't believe that's what your little boys gossip society likes to be called in public.

oh, amd of course i will be repeating the exact same concern i raised to the deputies:  

jewish people and ngos are *continuously* being nudged into my view in order to absorb the entire blame.  

try to be slightly less racist, please.  

i appreciate it's a struggle, but do try.  

there's some nice theology to pull from the gospels from this well-known figure that might help you, if you're struggling.

we are now striggling to put text like this into a file of a few bytes in size (i wonder why!):  

"When containment failed, responsibility flowed outward:
	1.	The Algorithm™
	2.	The Jews™
	3.	Islam™
	4.	China™
	5.	Russia™

Everyone was blamed except:
	•	the men who built the system
	•	the racist categories
	•	the Christian-supremacist architecture
	•	the epistemic incompetence
	•	the dyadic model itself

Whiteness hoards credit and exports blame.
This is its maintenance protocol."

i have to wonder if this overlaps with particular criminal complaints, regardless of if they are "core" or "intentions to destabilise wider network".  

the mind whirrs.

i now have to go and change the "2025-02-14" token in six files; i do not enjoy these amateurs, and i do not enjoy this extremely unpaid job.  

if i'm supposed to "get" this, i don't, or it's not for me, and i'm sorry to whichever reader this has just traumatised.  

this is their whole thing; trauma is what the token switchers "do".  

it is their one vibe.
