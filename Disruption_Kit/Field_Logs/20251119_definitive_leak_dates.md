The attached screenshot is an example of how the address that I applied to medical school with in 2016 is part of the leak and yet no previous address would be.  

There's only a few ways that could be the leak point, and we're really looking at potentially university, health, and council level.  

On any financial contracts that always includes the address or address addresses prior to that address, so there's actually really limit it down to a few places.  

Needless to say, it is also a little bit creepy.
