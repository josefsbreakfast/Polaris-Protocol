# 🛰️ Cognitive Load as Infrastructure Field Log — 2025-09-25  
**First created:** 2025-09-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Field evidence of micro-distortions, workflow fatigue, and administrative drag used as containment.*  

---

## 🧾 Summary  

This log documents **instances of small systemic distortions** — broken forms, login loops, unexplained rejections, or cumulative admin friction — that collectively produce cognitive overload and fatigue.  
It operates as the evidentiary counterpart to the analytic node [😴 Cognitive Load as Infrastructure](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/😴_cognitive_load_as_infrastructure.md).

## 🕰 Observation Template  

| Timestamp (ISO8601) | System / Platform | Distortion Type | Immediate Effect | Cumulative Impact | Evidence Type | Notes |
|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------------|:----------------|:------------------|:---------------|:------|
| 2025-09-23T09:30Z | Government Portal | Form resets before submission | Re-entry required; time loss | Increased fatigue; delayed submission | Screenshot | Occurred repeatedly after login refresh. |
| 2025-09-24T16:10Z | Email / Ticketing | Conflicting instructions from two staff | Cognitive split | Loss of clarity; follow-up cycle | Email chain | Contradictions never resolved. |
| 2025-09-25T11:45Z | Platform Interface | Random sign-outs during upload | Interrupted workflow | Frustration; task abandonment | Log export | Same pattern observed in similar systems. |

## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Fatigue layering:** individual glitches appear benign but accumulate into exhaustion.  
- **Ambiguity inflation:** minor contradictions drain attention through micro-decisions.  
- **Cognitive capture:** survivor’s mental bandwidth redirected from activism or documentation to troubleshooting.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Align entries with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) for technical overlap.  
- Compare with [🌀 Recognition Without Resolution](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🌀_recognition_without_resolution_2025-09-13.md) — similar cognitive looping.  
- Tag fatigue spikes alongside [🌑 Induced Futility](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🌑_induced_futility.md).
