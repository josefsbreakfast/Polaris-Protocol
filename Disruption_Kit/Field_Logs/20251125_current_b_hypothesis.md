i could be slightly wrong, lots of foia stonewalling, and its not as if i didnt tey to raise it theough secure routes, several times.  

this is current hypothesis on how b may be pressured whistleblower, and also why data is spliced.  

2016 - briefly meet at conference. b on project with intake data. harms start. no one actions non-sync profile; profound harms and non compliance by 2017.  

2018 - b whistleblowing as project picking up non-intended special cat data (ie the compensated cptsd).  

b diverted. likely assurance of change. query redeployed academic group.  

2022 - b raises case at different board i can name on human ethics. rather than any fix, a/b suppression group, spoofing or nudging to unknown hr case, ghost profile of a used against whistleblower b. moj data of a breached first instance; query r&d use voice data.  

2025 - whoops we basically gave the loud one an armed guard and then they were both at an out of area event together; panic. assume taking all guardrails off ai is somehow sensible, nudged to end user as prompt resolve, b impersonation part of bizarre set up. still somehow the gora are offended when the a in a/b pair points out not israeli. ihra sighs in nuremberg code. it also feels very used.  

i will accept cookies if i was nearly there.  

this is the stricture i'm exploring, because the linkage can help fix the data problem.  

also i am understandably cross at precosely what i've been signed up for in r&d.
