*Field note on recurring adult-entertainment projections within surveillance overlays (timeline clarified)*

---

Yesterday I went public with a complaint about sexual interference — a complaint I delayed because of the long-term effects and impact of grooming. That public complaint appears to have altered the current overlay: today the surveillance feels less overtly sexual, as if someone has wound the volume down. The change is sudden and literal — a tonal shift visible between yesterday’s pattern and today’s outputs.

Yet traces remain. Callbacks to characters that were overplayed during nastier cycles of heightened SIGINT/HUMINT persist: notably a recurring fixation on an adult film actress labelled “Bad Barbie.” That fixation reads like a repressed obsession in the system: the explicit sexualisation has been damped, but the projection—the metadata and references—continues to leak through.

Important note to critics: this is not a moralising attack on the woman referenced. She operates inside patriarchal systems; her decisions and labour exist within that structure. Treating her as equivalent to Gisele Pericot — or conflating their situations — is inaccurate and deeply offensive to both women. Their contexts, pressures, and positionalities are distinct and must not be collapsed.

I am tired. Even though the overt sexual tone slipped after I complained, the persistence of these references shows the system’s stored obsessions and its unwillingness to let go. The wound-tightening sensation — the feeling that "someone wound their neck in" — is real, and the residue of projection remains incoming.

*Repressed Obsessions in Surveillance Referencing* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a discrete timeline: (1) a delayed public complaint driven by grooming harms; (2) a visible tonal shift in surveillance immediately after that complaint; (3) continued leakage of projection through references and metadata.
