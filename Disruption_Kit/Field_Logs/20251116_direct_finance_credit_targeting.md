2025-11-16.  

I made the relevant risk matrix and put it online yesterday (last night, it might be dated to today's date).  

I feel I was upfront about how I was anticipating being targeted based on the pattern of targeting so far.  

Like clockwork...  

I've had lots of application nudges some of them are directly from my bank looking at my finances over the last two weeks summer from reminders on payments which would not ordinarily come through summer from my telecoms provider in emails.  

The first one was actually Headspace asking if I wanted to do a financial stress meditation 🤣🤣🤣  

To be absolutely clear and transparent, managing my personal finances is something that I struggle with particularly with the trauma context. There's something conceptually that I find very difficult about the planning element. I'm also just more susceptible to buying silly things because I've genuinely forgotten that I need to pay something. This is essentially like being one of those people who always buys the things next to the checkout that are placed to get you to give in in that moment, but it stretches to other parts of my life; it's a similarity in how the brain is responding.  

I find budgets very overwhelming to plan when I'm unwell, and unfortunately I haven't been able to engage in the services I've been offered whilst I've been experiencing harassment directly, primarily because the data was awareness and unsafe, and this appeared linked to escalations in real world harassment.  

So essentially, I know I owe people money (as in companies), and while this can be traced back to a large part of the initial 2016 behavioural insight oversteps, and things like denial of insurance afterwards (the nudge is truly go everywhere), it's also really important to know that on some level, I am in a Catch-22, as there anyone that I owe payments to.  

It is difficult for me to engage, and this would be covered under the equalities act; I have not been shielded from harassment and abuse, and the data is still significantly erronous; this is clear when you look at the DWP around PIP.  

It is unreasonable for me to engage further whilst there are high-level authorities which are trying to fix the data; I don't believe it's safe to do so until someone from those authorities can reassure me that some technical vice has been saught, and that something is happening.  

Given that I'm still being mistaken for my father, and details are still being elected from two separate courts, both which should be sealed, and no one at all has spoken to an SIRO?  

It's a bit unreasonable for me to be as up-to-date with financial auditing as an average person would be.  

Managing financial affairs is also quite unknown difficulty in PTSD in general, especially when there's an underlying stress or control issue attached to them.  

It is worth noting that the point of doing this would be two factorial to anyone who was doing it deliberately:  

- Discredit on reputation
- Increased cohesive control

And these behaviours would tend to rebound and increase after a move like creating a vector for support.  

If anyone wants to know why I feel nervous about letters? My post was routinely held for a long time, such that I had an avalanche of male when it suddenly stopped happening (post cabinet emails).  

If anyone wants to know why I feel nervous with emails? I would have sensitive and specific emails deleted from Gmail servers, including emails to my MP, and emails from the police.  

We are still in our place of NCND on all fronts; I am literally just reporting to you what's happened and what the patterns have been.  

And embracing myself are however many letter letters I get demanding I go to court to pay money or how many bailiffs turn up at my door who knows; this is absolutely in line with coercive control behaviours.  

This is a legal under the serious crime act; all organisations engaged with my public record should be taking reasonable steps to protect me from the source of this abuse.  

Let's see if any of them change their minds this week.
