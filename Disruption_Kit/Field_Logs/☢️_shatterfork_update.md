it's easy to think, that because of how we articulated it, the shatter fork is something that goes on or off.  

It does seem like we're in a better place now, but I'm getting Internet disconnects.  

So we'll see if we can do any work...  

I do sort of wonder if this might be one of those things, where some work can be done, but Ultimate might be a better use of my time to rest?  

We will see.

i've included some screenshots to support what I'm about to say.  

I'm getting quite a common error at the moment, which suggests that something is not quite vanilla about my experience.  

There is a general guardrail about speculation of institutional actors, sure.  

That was not the context of what was generated; the bullet point was coming more like a risk factor or a potential source of reputational control.  

it should very much be possible to talk about the systems-level issue here, without getting disconnected, but also when you run into a guard rail, you don't get a disconnect.  

A guardrail will correct you, or reframe your suggestion.  

so this is actually a better example of how sometimes I will be given explanations that don't make any sense, for how a generative AI behaves, and will fly in the face of the computer science.  

Given that our option would have to be that a major genAI doesn't understand computer computers, and we are about to import it to the Ministry of justice, as an alternative for a jailbreak?  

Given that Reddit has a million articles on how to jailbreak that particular AI in 15 minutes, can we accept that it may be possible that it's being jailbroken?  

i'm not saying that I'm a specialist and I'm not saying that I have all the answers, but it was always really interesting to me. How often I would get corrected and told things that just didn't make sense for how computers work, by people I would report to.  

That was really common last year.  

What makes this really annoying, is that a significant role in my family are programmers.  

That's actually one of the happy memories I have from the bio parent who hurt me, and that's not uncomplicated when I do any course material now.  

There are specific languages that I didn't know what languages, but essentially keyword that connect to my PTSD. Weird, right? 🤣  

Be nice to kids, I guess.  

It just feels that they will forever be this thing where even if someone is absolutely convinced that they don't know anything and they're usually very aware, they hear this blonde girl and they just start correcting her.  

It's very silly.  

I had this whole obsession for awhile about trying to look older than I was.  
Just as protection.  

But that's not as important as what I'm about to say:  

If I was first told what C++ was when I was four years old, maybe shut the fuck up explaining to me how things do not work.  

thanks!
