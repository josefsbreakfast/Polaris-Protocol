it's easy to think, that because of how we articulated it, the shatter fork is something that goes on or off.  

It does seem like we're in a better place now, but I'm getting Internet disconnects.

I do sort of wonder if this might be one of those things, where some work can be done, but Ultimate might be a better use of my time to rest?  

We will see.
