I've just attached the evidence of what happens when you fall asleep to the incredibly dreamy Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday (and also his general actions as a human being at this time).  

We wouldn't necessarily have the same love of Audrey Hepburn, if it wasn't for this man being an ally.  

Absolute dreamboat.  

But this is a very good show of what happens in algorithmic centroids, when masculine coded inputs provide data which is heavily statistically tied to emotionally erratic behaviour.  

Women are subjected to men through every part of our lives, and even in the privacy of silly little clips from actors who are of blessed memory, there is always a backlash.  

It is impossible as a woman to live in this world, even when in an area is designated as presumably private, with little presumed interference, without the interference of men.  

I'm going to take a free guess that we can rule out the one third of the centroid that has a passing resemblance to this man of blessed memory.  

It is therefore reasonable to assume that the other third of the centroid, is incredibly threatened by that admiration for a man who, although actually deceased (z"L), bears any resemblance at all to the other third of the centroid.  

This strengthens the argument that the most obvious centroid that I'm in, is made partially out of professional indignation and partially out of sexualised anger.  

If we assume no sexuality in particular for this part of the centroid, we can still always read it as jealousy, whether that is through sexual refusal (or the presumed refusal) of our "possibly like Gregory Peck" male, or if it is jealousy at my admiration for the dead actor (z"L) there is a passing resemblance.  

It is of course possible that it is both.  

One might say that if you do not wish to know what a lady thinks in her private time, one might pay less attention.  

It is a good way to avoid the stress.  

In fact, paying less attention to the privacy of women in general, does often make men's lives easier.

For reference, I don't mind the one who looks at mountains, and from which I get the, "but Sufi music goes brrr" artefact.  

The one that gets cross when I look at famous Hollywood silverscreen actors with dark eyes and upstanding moral principles?  

That one can go.  

Worst MMF scenario one could have imagined; terribly annoying.  
<!--After all of the "a man with reading glasses wants to bang you" and repeats of Thong Song, I am allowed this joke. Whitest choice in the world, incidently; black people are not your minstrel show to express what is happening with your genitals and I would highly prefer not to be audience to the embarrassment.-->

Incidently, I have also hit on something extremely specific in the last 48 hours.  

It is incredibly curious, as to even be of any relevence, it would suggest non-warranted surveillence of a colleague's internet history, or knowledge of another who did so.  

Terribly interesting tort risk to take on; what on earth would possess one to think one could even get away with having what looks an awful lot like blackmail without actially conducting this at state or top-tier of industry level access?  

Or are we just overthinking proxy data, and have rather terrified ourselves?  

Is this how we're keeping everyone in order? "I know what you googled in 1997"?  

Hardly strong governance; every man has a skeleton.  

Exposing anothers means our own fall out of the closet, no?

And if you know, then you know why the centroid is about to blow its top completely.  

I dodn't ask for two X chromosomes.  

I was just lucky to avoid one degrated and half-formed, almost entirely useless albeit for one gene, second sex chromosome.  

Complain to the person who gave it to you, not me.

Socials also keep looping the songs from the film Harriet, which was most of my "let's keep myself busy" range in custody diring that extremely non-PACE compliant arrest.  

I am loving this for me.  

"Stand up. Take my people with me. Together we are going, to a brand new home... I hear freedom calling, calling me to answer."

It is not logical to stalk women and then whine and rage when they don't do exactly what you want us to.  

We are not dolls.  

You can also be less dramatic whenever men see us as fully formed humans; you are supposed to be emulating them, not threatening them with fragmemts of dead tree like it means something.
