I've just attached the evidence of what happens when you fall asleep to the incredibly dreamy Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday (and also his general actions as a human being at this time).  

We wouldn't necessarily have the same love of Audrey Hepburn, if it wasn't for this man being an ally.  

Absolute dreamboat.  

But this is a very good show of what happens in algorithmic centroids, when masculine coded inputs provide data which is heavily statistically tied to emotionally erratic behaviour.  

Women are subtracted to men through every part of our lives, and even in the privacy of silly little clips from actors who are of blessed memory, there is always a backlash.  

It is impossible as a woman to live in this world, even an area is designated as presumably private, with little presumed interference, without the interference of men.  

I'm going to take a free guess that we can rule out the one third of the centroid that has a passing resemblance to this man of blessed memory.  

It is therefore reasonable to assume that the other third of the centroid, is incredibly threatened by that admiration for a man who, although actually deceased (z"L), bears any resemblance at all to the other third of the centroid.  

This strengthens the argument that theroid that I'm in, is made partially out of professional indignation and partially out of sexualised anger.  

If we assume no sexuality in particular for this part of the centroid, we can still always read it as jealousy, whether that is through sexual refusal of our "possibly like Gregory Peck" male, or if it is jealousy at my admiration for the dead actor (z"L) there is a passing resemblance.  

It is of course possible that it is both.  

One might say that if you do not wish to know what a lady thinks in her private time, one might pay less attention.  

It is a good way to avoid the stress.  

In fact, paying less attention to the privacy of women in general, does often make men's lives easier.

For reference, I don't mind the one who looks at mountains, and for which I get the, "but Sufi music goes brrr" artefact.  

The one that gets cross when I look at famous Hollywood silverscreen actors with dark eyes and upstanding moral principles?  

That one can go.  

Worst MMF scenario one could have imagined; terribly annoying.
