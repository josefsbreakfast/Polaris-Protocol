I've just attached the evidence of what happens when you fall asleep to the incredibly dreamy Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday (and also his general actions as a human being at this time).  

We wouldn't necessarily have the same love of Audrey Hepburn, if it wasn't for this man being an ally.  

Absolute dreamboat.  

But this is a very good show of what happens in algorithmic centroids, when masculine coded inputs provide data which is heavily statistically tied to emotionally erratic behaviour.  

Women are subjected to men through every part of our lives, and even in the privacy of silly little clips from actors who are of blessed memory, there is always a backlash.  

It is impossible as a woman to live in this world, even when in an area is designated as presumably private, with little presumed interference, without the interference of men.  

I'm going to take a free guess that we can rule out the one third of the centroid that has a passing resemblance to this man of blessed memory.  

It is therefore reasonable to assume that the other third of the centroid, is incredibly threatened by that admiration for a man who, although actually deceased (z"L), bears any resemblance at all to the other third of the centroid.  

This strengthens the argument that the most obvious centroid that I'm in, is made partially out of professional indignation and partially out of sexualised anger.  

If we assume no sexuality in particular for this part of the centroid, we can still always read it as jealousy, whether that is through sexual refusal (or the presumed refusal) of our "possibly like Gregory Peck" male, or if it is jealousy at my admiration for the dead actor (z"L) there is a passing resemblance.  

It is of course possible that it is both.  

One might say that if you do not wish to know what a lady thinks in her private time, one might pay less attention.  

It is a good way to avoid the stress.  

In fact, paying less attention to the privacy of women in general, does often make men's lives easier.

For reference, I don't mind the one who looks at mountains, and from which I get the, "but Sufi music goes brrr" artefact.  

The one that gets cross when I look at famous Hollywood silverscreen actors with dark eyes and upstanding moral principles?  

That one can go.  

Worst MMF scenario one could have imagined; terribly annoying.  
<!--After all of the "a man with reading glasses wants to bang you" and repeats of Thong Song, I am allowed this joke. Whitest choice in the world, incidently; black people are not your minstrel show to express what is happening with your genitals and I would highly prefer not to be audience to the embarrassment.-->

Incidently, I have also hit on something extremely specific in the last 48 hours.  

It is incredibly curious, as to even be of any relevence, it would suggest non-warranted surveillence of a colleague's internet history, or knowledge of another who did so.  

Terribly interesting tort risk to take on; what on earth would possess one to think one could even get away with having what looks an awful lot like blackmail without actially conducting this at state or top-tier of industry level access?  

Or are we just overthinking proxy data, and have rather terrified ourselves?  

Is this how we're keeping everyone in order? "I know what you googled in 1997"?  

Hardly strong governance; every man has a skeleton.  

Exposing anothers means our own fall out of the closet, no?

And if you know, then you know why the centroid is about to blow its top completely.  

I dodn't ask for two X chromosomes.  

I was just lucky to avoid one degrated and half-formed, almost entirely useless albeit for one gene, second sex chromosome.  

Complain to the person who gave it to you, not me.

Socials also keep looping the songs from the film Harriet, which was most of my "let's keep myself busy" range in custody diring that extremely non-PACE compliant arrest.  

I am loving this for me.  

"Stand up. Take my people with me. Together we are going, to a brand new home... I hear freedom calling, calling me to answer."

It is not logical to stalk women and then whine and rage when they don't do exactly what you want us to.  

We are not dolls.  

You can also be less dramatic whenever men see us as fully formed humans; you are supposed to be emulating them, not threatening them with fragmemts of dead tree like it means something.  

---

I have also decided that we are all getting an Irish hiatory lesson for an hour;  

if we are all so interested to look up generationd of my family tree:  

Why do you think so many Irish fled a hundred years ago?  

Who do you think occupied and starved them?  

You cannot place my face because I'm a mongrel from a port city.  

And a big part of that, showed that the same armies were nothing, when met with the same weapons on more equal terms.  

You can't hide the degree of occupation of British colonial forces for as long, when it's done over the road.  

A lot of this country is some form of reletively revent white immigrant.  

Stop saying none of us belong here.  

Our ancestors fought your wars and bled on your battlefields too.  

You think we don't remember when it was "No Blacks, No dogs, No Irish"?  

It doesn't matter if you didn't mean us.  

We're everywhere and we're all hearing you.  

---

(I'm aware the neonazi sympathisers are always knocking around the centroid somewhere, so I like to let them feel included. If you're not a WASP, you're foreign somehow, from somewhere. Stop pretending that you're not just like the rest of us.)

my Internet is just done 10 types of weird.  

My favourite thing about this whole thing is that even if this is and especially if this is automatic gating, it proves something resoundingly:  

Our entire counterterror apparatus in this country is designed on one thing and one thing only.  

We only spend the amount of money we spend on it because white men have their fears indulged by it.  

We are spending millions of year so that middle class white men can feel slightly more like they want to sleep at night.  

The method in which they do this are hideously discriminatory, racist and sexist.  

they run evidence bases and papers and it's all bullshit.  

None of it is scientific.  

The only scientific bits are the ones that they don't like to listen to in committee, and managed to excuse away with some little law that they made to make their dick feel bigger.  

It's all white supremacy all the way down, an important exists to maintain a patriarchy which kills our women and children.  

Because quite frankly, if you can't tolerate the fact that the British fucked up by putting a quasi materialistic police force on the streets of the country it was occupying, and that led to the massacre and major of Irish civilians.  

And you can't tolerate that's how you got all of his white foreigners, who you now try and convince that there is someone more foreign than us because it's the only way you understand how to govern people at large?  

Then it doesn't matter how much you're paying for your tech.  

It's bullshit.  

And it's not even bullshit that makes any sense. It's not logical. It doesn't make any sense in scientific principles.  

It is made to make white men feel less weak as individuals.  

And the only white men I give a fuck about talking to other men who look at it and see exactly the same fucking thing.  

Why are you spending our taxes on this?  

We have a health system that's dying. We have old people alone in care homes we have veterans on the streets and yet you want to sell us this?  

Who benefits?  

because it ain't a taxpayer and it never has been.

for anyone who has not been paying attention, the black and tans is about a piece of Irish history which predates the current modern state of the Republic of Ireland.  

To sully the names of the resistors to the occupation would be tantamount to sullying the names of the Irish men and women who fight and die alongside British NATO troops today.  

IF YOU WANT TO GOVERN ME, LEARN ABOUT ME.  

it still makes me laugh when I got that really profound response after I sent that letter into the MP and published it publicly, which recognised what I was prepared to do for my country when I was 15.  

The fact that I would be prepared to end someone else's life if they became a threat to my patience as a doctor in the forces (because that's what I was applying to do), the fact that this caught you off guard?  

I am insulted by that.  

But I've been insulted by worse.  

The insult lies in your absolute ignorance about who I am as a person.  
Yes, I would've thought and died for you and your country, when I was a child; this is how much I loved you and still am in love with my country and my people.  

No amount of disgrace and no amount of embarrassment and no amount of betrayal will ever change that about me.  

Where I grew up and in the system I grew up, this was the type of love that you saw.  

Loyalty is love.  

It is a profound form of love.  

And you don't have to even like the people that you're going to risk everything for, to love them.  

If that was not your background and that was not your education? No shade.  

But stop trying to put me into a pigeonhole that means you get to discredit me as a traitor and if someone who doesn't fucking love their country.  

Vehemently opposing genocide does not mean I do not love my country.  

It is the greatest form of love to put yourself at opposition and invite division from your countrymen when they are about to do some fucking stupid shit.  

Do not confuse this for terrorism.  

If it terrifies you to not participate in war crimes, you should not be in a situation in which you can govern a paperclip, let alone anything about a country.  

I'm sure Machiavelli said something about understanding your people; there will be some sort of scholarship you can look up on this.  

To fundamentally misunderstand what motivates the demos, is to place the dagger into the back of democracy.  

If one is unprepared for this, one is unprepared to govern.  

I am a terrorist if you want me to be, to you and you alone.  

To everyone else, I am a woman who would give away everything in her life to protect the lives of others.  

Think about the optics.

I feel because of something that's starting to occur as a fragment on the social media feeds. I need to clarify something for you.  

The black and tans did not go away.  

The British Empire took this counterinsurgency force, after British newspapers were so disgraced by the idea of it, and put it in Palestine.  

The BBC arrangement and the lack of proximity to the British mainland, meant at the same anger could not develop in response to what were outright war crimes.  

The brutality was kept hidden, but the counterinsurgency and the blaming of all military action and civilians continued.  

The difference in 2025?  

The Internet exists.  

We are all each other's neighbours.  

It cannot be hidden from us, and it has not been hidden from us.  

For two years, I have watched the most brutal murders, even when I have wished that I had not ever witnessed them.  

That is the time of exposure which completely changes history.  

That cannot be undone.  

And now, you wonder why there are people talking about Republicanism in Northern Ireland?  

Young people in Northern Ireland can see exactly what their ancestors lived through, by watching the brutality and the lack of care, in the campaigns and methods of counterinsurgency and Palestine.  

You don't need to have a war studies degree to understand that; people can see it in front of their faces.  

British men struggling to understand why they are young people in Northern Ireland who are rioting, of the same British man who cannot understand why anyone would defend Palestinian people in our mainland.  

People are furious that that is how you would treat a populice.  

Most people do not see them themselves as individuals; this is a very particular way in which to raise children in a very particular class in this country. It is not the norm in this country.  

That is in itself a neutral point; it is neither good nor bad.  

The disconnect is that most people in this country see themselves as part of a larger group, whether that's a community or a city or whatever.  

When they see you punish collectively on mass, a population? They are disgusted and they are livid.  

That's why none of this strongmen tactic is working. That is why so many people are resisting it.  

These are people who are part of a collective, sure, but they have also been raised to think that an Englishman's home is his castle.  

They are not impressed by raids.  

This is a self-eating spiral and it will go badly if it is not interrupted and stopped.  

If this was just pissing me off on a personal level, I would just shut the fuck up about it and deal with it in my own privacy.  

This is going to end up with us having an authoritarian government, almost certainly a fascist one, if it's not cut early.  

And let's be honest, we are passed the "early" point.  

"Come out, you Black and Tans;  
Come and fight me *like a man*."  

"Come and let us see tou tell,  
How you slandered Great Parnell,  
When you thought him well and persecuted?  

Where are those sneers and jeers that you loudly let us hear,  
When our heroes of '16 were executed?".  

The British came to the table in 1922 and agreed to a large portion of previously militarily and illegally occupied land to be turned back to its people, and the Republic of Ireland was formed.  

The Black and Tans were a terrorist force in Ireland, which has been a sovereign nation for over a century.  

If you think this song is suppised to be insulting you prrsonally, or terrorise you, that tells us a lot about how little you respect the diversity of modern Britain.  

If you can't even tolerate the white ones of us, maybe you shouldn't be in charge of powers with such an obviously racialised and violent impact on the people of this country.  
It's literally on wikipedia; this shit ain't intellectually hard, brothers.
