givsn the escalation ehen i first made a police complaint, which by the time it went downstream, became a two-person meeting to mentsl health wuth wuestions thst i had never disclosed the prerequisate information to mh...  

which to those who are new, can look a lit like the pre-assesmeng of "do wr need to section this patient?"...  

and im being clear that mh may be acting in best faith on informayion they have available...  

then tomorrow i am going into an appointment designed to screen for psychosis.  

im thinking the rusi free lunch nsy be a more tempting option.  

but seriously:  

i have now asked for and not yet received duty of candour for long running data errors whoch originate at the attached teaching institution.  

and if it was psychosis? this has been several months intervening; i would be significantly more unwell by now, and well past ideal time to intervene.  

so im not really sire what to expect.  


not just the data error, and the controlker plus mh team, but also the narrative which has grown and eaten since the 2022 trisl all overlap here.  

so im asking myself if i can even go.  

this, of course, may be vetoed by my body anyway; my pelvis is behsbing like something cast into the rock.  

but i think this is an important inflection point to understsnd how my risk paradoxically can increase by attending an nhs "pkace of safety", but also by declining to,  

and how much this then mimics the risk of arrest.
