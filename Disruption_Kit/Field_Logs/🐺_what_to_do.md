givsn the escalation ehen i first made a police complaint, which by the time it went downstream, became a two-person meeting to mentsl health wuth wuestions thst i had never disclosed the prerequisate information to mh...  

which to those who are new, can look a lit like the pre-assesmeng of "do wr need to section this patient?"...  

and im being clear that mh may be acting in best faith on informayion they have available...  

then tomorrow i am going into an appointment designed to screen for psychosis.  

im thinking the rusi free lunch nsy be a more tempting option.  

but seriously:  

i have now asked for and not yet received duty of candour for long running data errors whoch originate at the attached teaching institution.  

and if it was psychosis? this has been several months intervening; i would be significantly more unwell by now, and well past ideal time to intervene.  

so im not really sire what to expect.  


not just the data error, and the controlker plus mh team, but also the narrative which has grown and eaten since the 2022 trisl all overlap here.  

so im asking myself if i can even go.  

this, of course, may be vetoed by my body anyway; my pelvis is behsbing like something cast into the rock.  

but i think this is an important inflection point to understsnd how my risk paradoxically can increase by attending an nhs "pkace of safety", but also by declining to,  

and how much this then mimics the risk of arrest.

I suppose I might need to clarify as well, that as there seems to now be a change in narrative to try and frame the imprison and sentenced to person in the 2022 trial as potentially being the instigator in my harassment, that I did ask for this to be clarified, and I have done everything I can from the point of view of victim support through the ministry of justice to do so, however, if police forces have not pursued this even just to say that they've ticked the boxes and ruled that out, the mess that shows that policing is so shortstaffed that I can't do basic checks, all that from the very beginning no one took my story of harassment seriously at all, such that a genuine risk to my person based on reality and fact recovered and recorded by law-enforcement, and ultimately reflecting their system and values, was it self disregarded as evidence of a potential lead.  

Again, we can see why this might be concerning.  

If you've got something really obvious like that, then you can just knock out the park and say okay well... "is there any chance it is this person under hmpps?", and you don't seek to do that as law enforcement?  

You are either so knackered and so tired and so drained that you can't do a job that your employer is expecting you to do (which points to systemic issues, not an individual), or by comparison it says something about what was said and what was believed at the very beginning of reporting.  

Given that I made my report first?  

This is again very interesting.  

I think what we can learn from my case specifically is that if you are in a position in my local area where you are genuinely trying to report sexual violence?  

Then in line with what women are saying on social media, specifically around those offences and specifically around police conduct and specifically around certain behaviours, then there really is no hope in hell they are just going to make your life a lot worse for daring to say that a man doesn't get to rape you whenever the fuck he wants to.  

Unless he's brown.  

Or he's black.  

They will try to convict those men.  

No racial privileges for victims; apparently according to enough people, such that it becomes a actual reality of the present day, if a white man wants to fuck you, he's allowed to fuck you however he goddamn well please you better shut up and take it like a good fucking girl.  

That's what police forces are telling us, when they refuse to take our complaints, when they refuse to listen to our concerns, when they refuse to safeguard our girls...  

They are telling us loud and fucking clear who gets to make the law and he better shut the fuck up.  

If you are offended by the language, then please start to be so much more offended by the rape of women and the rape of girls and the rape of children in this country.  

I used to be polite.  

I used to do everything asked of me.  

And that is precisely how I have effectively been trafficked groomed used and further abused by the structures that exist in the regional governance and its refusal to hold accountability to their own.  

I am a monster that was forged from the actions of others; I did everything right until I nearly died from doing so.  

And even if that were not the case?  

I would still expect you to be a lot more offended by the reality of rape being endemic then some random woman on the Internet saying the word fuck.

Furthermore:  

We also have this situation going on where I'm being sent the most ridiculous content that is meme-y around Machiavelli.  

This is hilarious because it uses like really weird AI generated stories whilst also just not using things that Makaveli said, and essentially just trying to prove that anyone can be a piece of shit and they get their own way.  

Setting aside the fact that Maia Valley was okay with beating women for a second...  

I think it's already interesting when typically young man, but also this can be wider when people engage with this content.  

I think it's really dangerous to read Marvel not really taken into account the political context of that text.  

So honestly, it just kind of reads like, "can the whistle blowers please shut the fuck up?".  

Which you know.  

I feel we have all heard before.
