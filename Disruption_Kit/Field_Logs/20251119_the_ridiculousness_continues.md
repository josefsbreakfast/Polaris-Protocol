ive now had a suspended income dwp payment from frankenstack errors, which may or may not be nudged.  

this puts me in the "at risk of a known pattern of preventable deaths" category, and i need the people who dont think there has been a civil rights issue in this area to do their research before they yap on tv about it.  

i am very aware of the risk and my fragility will progress in a way that could be caught earlier.  

no one deserves to die, particularly not in the manner which these people died.  

these deaths are a policy choice, and in my mind that puts some degree of planning and known culpabikity behind those choices.  

to hear nonsense about bringing back the death oenality shows the degradation of our suppised shared values and our supposed humanity, and this will progress, if not stopped, to include *anyone* who has ever been or could ever be labelled as "inferior".  

you never think they will come for you until you meet them at the doir and tell them your name and suddendly they have come to take you to a cell.  

no one sees it, so open your eyes.
