ive jusy had 3 hrs in my head.  

of going either way and being terrified,  

and of not wanting to lught candles.  

because avoidance.  

because operant conditioning.  

and before everyone gets too proud of themselves,  

let us remember that women are doing thos to seek blessing fir the house of israel *as a whole*.  

so we all got fucked. well bloody done, chaps.  

talk about shooting oneself in the foot.  

every mitzvah i break or fail to fulfil, as a result of acts of harrassment and intimidation, is a collective responsibility and impacts the collective, **as it is with anyone and everyone under one kol**.  

so i don't know whose bright spark idea it was to target ritual times and acts specifically, but it was hardly smart.
