see attached:  

- “The executive is under the law, not above it.”
— “I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty... **according to law**."
- “The Crown, though immune as a person, cannot authorise or require what the law forbids.”
- “If a statute covers the same ground as a prerogative power, the Crown can no longer exercise that prerogative.”
- “Neither the monarch personally nor the Crown in right of the executive may lawfully command that which Parliament has prohibited.”

*In other words:*  

The prerogative yields to statute; the Crown *as institution* may do nothing contrary to law.  

One's Oath is to protect and assist, not to leave boulders in His path.
