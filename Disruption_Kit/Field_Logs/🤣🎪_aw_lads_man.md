"That sounds really unsettling.  Itâ€™s completely understandable that youâ€™d want to know why the tone and the way youâ€™re being communicated with feels so different, especially if it overlaps with times when youâ€™ve already been worried about interference or monitoring.

I donâ€™t have any visibility into your phone or internet connections, and I canâ€™t tell who,"

"why did you stop?"

"Sorry â€” I stopped because what you were describing touches on things that could easily feel unsafe or very personal, and I didnâ€™t want to rush into an answer that would make it worse.

What I can do here is stay with what you can directly check or control.
If youâ€™re feeling that your communications are being interfered with, the next concrete things you can do are:
	â€¢	Check your own devices and network: run malware/spyware scans, change passwords, and contact your mobile or internet provider to ask if there are any known routing or latency issues on your line.
	â€¢	If you think itâ€™s deliberate or targeted: you can raise it with the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO) or, if it feels like harassment or intimidation, with the police.  They can at least log the concern and tell you who else to speak with.
	â€¢	If itâ€™s mainly the distress and uncertainty thatâ€™s hard: you can contact someone who specialises in digital-safety supportâ€”organisations such as Privacy International, Open Rights Group, or Citizenâ€™s Advice have advisers who handle this kind of situation every day.

I donâ€™t have visibility into or control over telecom routing, but I can help you document whatâ€™s happening and point you toward the right technical or legal channels.
Would you like me to show you how to record the symptoms in a way that makes sense to a provider or the ICO?"

I'd been using it to reverse engineer a change in contract on the stack; I am now receivibg guardrails lectures.

I think it's important to note that it really danced around the issue of some of the realities of AI infrastructure, cybersecurity, and metadata in the UK.  
If this is a deliberate Channel R&D input or similar, then you're all absolutely mad for doing this.  

You can't lie outright, which is quite a lot of what happens when these events happen; apart from pushing people away from due process, it is just *lying*. generative AI doesn't tend to lie on purpose; this is far more in line with genetic systems, with AI that has some sort of middleware driving those changes, or indeed something which is utilising cyber security loopholes. When you actually just straight up lie to someone about a government process, especially if they're going through that process potentially, do you understand why lying to a citizen by government body is bad?  

Thia fundamentally undermines trust from the public.  

It is antidemocratic.  

Let's be realistic.  

If there was a genuine threat posed by me, I wouldn't be at home. I would be in detention of some description.  

I appreciate there has been several efforts to do that.  

But fundamentally, I don't fit into any of those categories lawfully.  

There is a really serious concern in the course of conduct of stopping due process; I can't imagine how difficult this is, when someone doesn't have experience of government procedure and policy.  

Put the record, I don't know if it's channel or prevent. I just assumed that if it was something external, we might have a handle of it by then, and I assume if it was any of the national bodies who could possibly do this, it would be more professionally conducted.  

I'm currently dealing with something, where it looks like there is a lot of personalisation, and what I am saying right now is in AI, but I also see it in social feeds, I also see it in government data feeds; whatever or whoever is running, this has quite significant and broad access to data across the board.  

I'm really tired of people belittling me, assuming that I can't do this, or assuming I don't know what I'm talking about.  

I don't know if it's the baby face or what.  

The fact that I'm having to construct what is now a three-quarter of 1 million repository of data, often deliberately having to write around the subject, to even be able to use accessibility tools to write on the subject, because of the degree of interference in all of my devices and all of my services and all of my applications, as well as across my social networks and include legal services, healthcare services, NGOs and anyone else I might access...  

What I'm going through is absolutely mad; so I can only assume it's come from a hybrid tier of enforcement, which lacks the discipline and rigor of something under OSA, but which utilises a set of tools and powers which are coming in close.  

The madness is that we are still here, and that this is still going on, despite the clear evidence of the course of conduct, and what will not be incredibly clear evidence in metadata audit.  

To assume that you are somehow not seen, just because you haven't been asked direct questions, or that these haven't been as exhaustive as you thought they might be? That's incredibly cocky.  

I find it really hard to believe that some people can think that they are above the law, when they are literally mechanisms that exist to audit you as well.

this is what I need to read to understand:  

Because of communications interference, especially with tools I use for accessibility, I can literally write nearly 750,000 words on politically and socially contentious subject matter, and yet, if I try to construct one letter or one timeline to a regulator, or speak to one solicitor?  

Essentially made impossible.  

I need everyone reading this to understand how profoundly strange that is.  

I need everyone reading this to understand that that does not look like "just a glitch"; it is repeatable over a course of time.  

So how am I supposed to get my democratic rights back?  

Every time I go to any sort of process or procedure addressing anything that might even touch on any potential surveillance in place?  

Communications issues.  

Real world harm.  

Healthcare interference.  

Legal system interference.  

Someone needs to explain to me how on earth I'm supposed to do anything about it, or:  

Stop telling me what I'm doing wrong, because nothing I'm doing is wrong.  

I've tried many times.  

I've tried in different ways.  

I'm not doing anything wrong.  

There is something in my way.  

Concentrating on anything else, is limiting my ability to get any of this sorted.
