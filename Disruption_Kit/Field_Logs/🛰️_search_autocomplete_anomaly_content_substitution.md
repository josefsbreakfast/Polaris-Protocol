# 🛰️ Search Autocomplete Anomaly — Content Substitution Event  

**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  

*Neutral search query producing overt sexualised or unrelated results.*

---

## 📜 Description  

While researching gemstone references, the query **“purple blue sapphire stone”** entered into **DuckDuckGo** suddenly returned explicit sexualised imagery and autocomplete results (featuring blonde women) instead of neutral gemological content.  
The device had **Proton VPN disabled at the system level** (standard UK connection), eliminating the VPN layer as a cause.  
Immediately prior to the shift, normal search results (~10–20 entries of geological content) were visible. The anomaly appeared within seconds, overwriting the search panel and result previews.

## 🛠 Context  

- **Device / Browser / App:** (fill in, e.g., iPhone 14 Safari / DuckDuckGo app)  
- **Network type:** Home Wi-Fi (UK ISP)  
- **VPN:** Proton VPN **disabled** at device level  
- **Location (coarse):** United Kingdom

## 🔎 Observed Behaviour  

- Neutral gemstone search results replaced by overt pornographic imagery and keyword strings.  
- Content swap occurred inside **DuckDuckGo** autocomplete and main result list.  
- Occurred once VPN was off, not while tunnelling.  
- Subsequent attempts with the same query (after clearing cache / switching device) reverted to normal results.  
- Suggests a transient external injection or index poisoning event rather than permanent tagging.

## ⚙️ Possible Interference Vectors  

### 1. **Autocomplete Poisoning**  
Flooding of the DuckDuckGo keyword index with adult-associated terms, causing benign geological queries to surface corrupted suggestions.  
Effect often transient (hours–days) and may occur regionally.  

### 2. **Proxy / DNS Injection**  
Result stream modified by a compromised router, DNS cache, or ISP-level redirect.  
Check for HTTPS/TLS mismatches or third-party domains in result URLs.  

### 3. **Browser Extension Hijack**  
Extension-level scripts may alter search results; test again with all add-ons disabled.  

### 4. **Algorithmic Contamination**  
False correlation between “sapphire” and adult-media metadata (e.g. brand or performer name collisions).  
Known to cause temporary search-result crossover.  

### 5. **Targeted Trigger / Profiling Cue**  
Geo- or behaviour-specific autocomplete injection; can appear user-specific even if algorithmic.  
Cross-reference with [🛰️ Proximity Control Logs](../../Metadata_Sabotage_Network/🛰️_proximity_control_logs.md).

*Search Autocomplete Anomaly — Content Substitution Event* is a living field log of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a visibility and content-replacement anomaly for later correlation with suppression and interference logs.
