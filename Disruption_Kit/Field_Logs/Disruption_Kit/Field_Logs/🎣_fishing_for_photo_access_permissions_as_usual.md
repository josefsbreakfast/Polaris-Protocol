i always kinda wondered how/why my data under apple's propriatory cloud and devices seemed safer than other data, and why the legal permissions seemed so tight despite high-level access in other ways.  

guess that bridge got burned some time ago huh.  

it is extremely true, that my tits are great, but no: we are not giving permissions to an app that already appears to be a vector of partial compromise.  

we seed no ground until demands are met.  

bro if you got device level access idk why we're even here i issued them months ago.  

you think you got power? prove it.  

looks like sticking your divk in a bunch of api plugs to me.
