overexplaining is how you know its likely been coercive control, right?  

because i was going to just wrote something like, "after YEARS of strictly gendered force-tradwifing me, algorithm, and NOW you think i'm a bot for AVTUALLY LOOKING AT BREASTFEEDING KIT?!",  


and then i'm still breathing a bit too fast and can't really get it down.  

i don't even know why i'm scared.  


i heard something about new fertility norms and i just felt better and i wanted to have hope that life could live on.  


it doesn't have to be in that specific way, it just...  

do you know how many "your kids will be diluted" clips get on my feed?  

i feel like i'm still locked in a stupid white man's stupid regressive fantasy where he ping pongs us around on some database somewhere.  

it's grim, and i dislike it.
