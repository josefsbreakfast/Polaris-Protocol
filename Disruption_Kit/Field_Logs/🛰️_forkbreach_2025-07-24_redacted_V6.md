## üìó Strategic and Emotional Context (Redacted V6)

This is a difficult document to write.

I do not expect to publish it for open readership in full.
However, the decision to articulate this with raw honesty, is grounded in the desire to offer fellowship and recognition of the experiences of other survivors. That is the intent.
The source of this coercion is not a partner, a friend, or a family member. 
It has not been shared with those I would ordinarily turn to for support, because my disclosure, or my silence, around the most disturbing events has been strongly correlated with harm to those I care most deeply about. If this is a coincidence, there have simply been too many to ignore.
I have chosen to document these experiences, in a manner in which any party responsible for silencing or discrediting can no longer act without record.

I maintain my efforts to utilise existing institutional processes.

This incident scared me because:
- I could see all the possible scenarios in which it could be used to assert control.
- I could see how easily it could be rigged for anyone to trip when seeking basic support.
- I already knew how little regard we have for survivors.

And yet. I acted.

I did the thing I was being coerced into.

Did I ‚Äúfall for the trap‚Äù?

I was presented with multiple points of sensory stimuli which could be objectively validated, and consistent ‚Äúnudging‚Äù interactions over a course of time, which significantly affected my ability to focus, and then I was exposed to slowly escalating stimuli which, to a reasonable person, may suggest that another human being was experiencing profound physical distress.
I called 999 when I really felt neglect to do so in the case that there was a person in distress would in fact be criminal, and I called again to cancel the attendance when I entered a confined space with fibreglass exposure, as a ‚Äúhigh falls risk‚Äù person.

Why did I do such a ‚Äústupid thing‚Äù?

Because in my heart of hearts, I just needed to know there wasn‚Äôt someone who was in cardiac arrest in a crawl space in my house.

I knew it was near impossible.

I understood that injuring myself was a ridiculous thing to do.

But I just needed to know.

And the people who chose to influence me to believe that, were well aware that I was training to be a doctor.

What would you do?
