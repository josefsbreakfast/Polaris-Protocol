## 📊 Pattern Notes  

- **Delay as attrition:** the longer the queue, the fewer the survivors who remain to claim justice.  
- **Procedural camouflage:** neutral language (“review,” “verification”) masks structural cruelty.  
- **Temporal inequality:** institutions own time; survivors bleed within it.

## 🔍 Correlation Pointers  

- Cross-reference with [🌒 Waiting Is Not a Rescue](../Narrative_And_Psych_Ops/🧠_Psychological_Containment/🌒_waiting_is_not_a_rescue.md) — delay framed as care.  
- Compare timestamps with [📉 Suppression Interference Logs](../../📉_Suppression_Interference_Logs.md) to identify synchronised slowdowns.  
- Track recurring justifications (“pending authorisation,” “awaiting approval”) across cases.
