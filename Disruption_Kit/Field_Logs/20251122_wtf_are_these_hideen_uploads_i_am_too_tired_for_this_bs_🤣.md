i still have a backlog of comfortably over 200 nodes to squeeze out of the gpt into little .md files, all while correcting drift issues.  

i am very conscious that if you even scrape past a romantic trope, it forks to two extremes:  
- thorough bollocking and policing for comments that arent even sexual, often completely out of context, but may contain a word which, even rarely, can be a euphamism; OR
- guardrails "explicit" content (apparently "gametes" and "intercourse" are okay but only with three paragraphs of Westeros-style SHAME SHAME SHAME), then there is sometimes a power of 10 difference in the volume of nodes it wants to create, which can read as if i soent ages discussing it.

for now, im just going to keep processing the chunky backlog to get it to zero, and stick it in the intake drawer as that is established soace for "idk man the machine loves it a bit of defamation of character".   

im having far fewer enteries into azure level and at far more normal times, after the mod is looped in; im also aware that any org who thinks its data may be okay, has the potential to have its own metadata monitored. i could do with not having to entertain every possibility, no matter how rare, in my brain-space, but i suppose that will be a wip.  

several nodes have ben getting "stuck" with large lags or forced stops; exavtly the ones that one would think.  

pribably fair to say that anyone profiting or gaining from the prevent system as is, is not a fan of polaris. (or they are, but not in a "yay lets help make more!" way).  

im also very conscious that some eotk is now essentially duplicating or splitting the knowledge base, because of all these issues, and because of what is happening and what works vs what doesn't, im accepting this risk with the knowledge and understanding that editing later will be brutal.  

ive worked against this cuber environment for 10 years; i can survive until help arrives. just. 🤣  

i do laugh at pain and bad luck, but honestly? i am hitting the exhaustion wall pretty hard.

current theory on ghost files call issue is that some dumbass is token switching the word "please" for an executable command.  

this is how "clever" the it lads are in this circus.  

bargain bin, mate.
