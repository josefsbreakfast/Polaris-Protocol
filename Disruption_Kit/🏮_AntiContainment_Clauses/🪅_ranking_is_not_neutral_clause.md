*Refusal clause against algorithmic ranking as governance*

## ✨ Why This Matters  

Ranking systems are presented as neutral, as if they simply reflect “popularity” or “merit.”  
But every list, every page order, every trending feed is a governance decision.  

When a survivor’s words are buried under noise or pushed to the margins, it is not organic.  
It is a deliberate act of power — deciding who is amplified and who is silenced.  

Refusing the neutrality myth means exposing ranking for what it is: a system of control disguised as natural order.

## 📜 Clause  

Algorithmic ranking is a governance choice, not a natural order.  

*Example:* a survivor testimony is pushed to page ten of results, while corporate PR appears on page one. The order is not an accident of “relevance,” but a weighting choice made by platform owners.  

---

## 🚫 Refusal  

We refuse the neutrality myth.  
Every ranking mask is annotated, every demotion countered with collective amplification.  

*Example:* when a post is buried, survivors screenshot rankings, annotate the order, and collectively boost the buried work until it surfaces again. The manipulation is made visible.

## 🌉 Joining the Dots  

Ranking has always been political.  

In the *Hays Code* era of Hollywood, films were censored and reordered to reflect “moral priorities,” with queer and radical voices pushed to the bottom or erased entirely.  
In George Orwell’s *Animal Farm*, the slogan “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others” exposes the lie of neutral order.  
Music charts, too, have never been neutral: airplay, payola, and gatekeeping decided what was “popular.”  

Today, algorithms perform the same governance under the cover of neutrality.  
*Black Mirror’s “Nosedive”* showed life itself reduced to a social ranking score, while real-world feeds curate visibility invisibly.  

Musicians are some of the most direct witnesses.  
- **TaïZ’s “L’Algorithme”** treats the algorithm itself as a poetic device — an omnipresent rhythm that tracks, remembers, and governs our lives.  
- **HDZ’s “L’Algorithme”** takes the risk of naming specifics: later verses call out social exclusions and injustices that remain rare to speak aloud even now.  
- **Sami Thompson’s “Burner Account”** offers refusal by alter-ego — a grunge-metal protest that steps outside algorithmic curation altogether.  

Ranking is not neutral. It is curated containment. The refusal is to name it and to lift each other outside its order.

## 🐝 Everyday Practice  

- When you see a survivor’s work buried, deliberately boost it: retweet, share, link.  
- Take screenshots of manipulated rankings (search results, trending feeds) as evidence.  
- Build alternative charts: community-curated lists that amplify what matters.  
- Treat “top results” with suspicion: ask who benefits from the order you’re shown.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🪅 📊 📡 — Ranking exposed as governance, not nature.  
- *Animal Farm* (Orwell) → the lie of equality in an ordered system.  
- Hays Code Hollywood → curated visibility, voices erased by ranking.  
- Music charts → history of commercial ranking as governance.  
- *Black Mirror: Nosedive* → life reduced to a ranking score.  
- TaïZ — *L’Algorithme* → poetic witness: algorithm as rhythm of control.  
- HDZ — *L’Algorithme* → forensic witness: naming exclusions still rarely spoken.  
- Sami Thompson — *Burner Account* → refusal through alter-ego, outside algorithmic feeds.
