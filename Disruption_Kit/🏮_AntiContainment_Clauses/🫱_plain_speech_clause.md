# 🫱 Plain Speech Clause  
**First created:** 2025-11-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-22  
*A governance principle requiring that institutional language never obscure bodily or emotional reality in welfare, care, or harm contexts.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The **Plain Speech Clause** establishes a baseline rule for humane governance:

> **When bureaucratic language avoids naming bodily or emotional reality, duty of care is already being breached.**

This clause applies wherever institutions exercise authority over people’s bodies, wellbeing, safety, or dignity.  
It treats language not as neutral description, but as **operational infrastructure**.

Silence, euphemism, and abstraction are recognised here as risk factors — not professionalism.

---

## ✨ Key Ideas  

### 1. Naming Is a Duty  
If a policy cannot name:
- the body,
- harm,
- fear,
- pain,
- or consent,

then it cannot meaningfully protect them.

### 2. Euphemism Is a Governance Choice  
Abstract language does not reduce risk.  
It relocates it — usually onto those with the least power to contest it.

### 3. Plain Speech Is Preventative  
Clear vocabulary:
- narrows ambiguity,
- reduces discretionary abuse,
- and limits post-hoc narrative laundering.

## 🧠 Scope of Application  

This clause applies to:
- welfare policy,
- safeguarding frameworks,
- complaints handling,
- disciplinary processes,
- medical and psychological provision,
- operational guidance involving proximity, care, or authority.

It is **especially binding** where:
- power asymmetries exist,
- consent may be compromised,
- or reporting carries reputational risk.

---

## 🗣️ What Plain Speech Requires  

Plain speech means:
- using ordinary, accurate words for bodily acts and harms,
- distinguishing consent from compliance,
- naming emotions where they affect welfare outcomes,
- avoiding passive voice that obscures agency.

Examples:
- “Sexual contact” instead of “boundary issue”.
- “Physical pain” instead of “discomfort”.
- “Fear of retaliation” instead of “reluctance”.

Precision is not vulgarity.  
It is accountability.

---

## 🔕 What This Clause Prohibits  

Under this clause, the following are treated as **containment practices**:

- euphemisms that minimise harm,
- abstract nouns replacing lived experience,
- passive constructions that erase actors,
- “professional tone” used to silence complaint,
- moral reframing that converts injury into inconvenience.

These are not stylistic preferences.  
They are governance failures.

---

## 🧪 Enforcement Test  

The clause can be operationalised with a single question:

> **Could an affected person recognise their experience in this language?**

If the answer is no, the language fails.

---

## 🧿 Relationship to Other Anti-Containment Clauses  

This clause underpins:
- **🫱 Plain Speech & Intimacy in Operations** — applied welfare doctrine.
- **🧠 Linguistic Containment & Sexual Violence** — harm analysis.
- **🕳️ Absence as Signal** — what disappears when naming is forbidden.

It functions as a **linguistic red line** across the Polaris framework.
