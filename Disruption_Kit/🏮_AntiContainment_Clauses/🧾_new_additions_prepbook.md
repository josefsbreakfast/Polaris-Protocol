# 🧾 New Additions Prepbook  
**First created:** 2025-10-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-15  

*A scratchpad for emerging AntiContainment clauses — draft form only.  
These will later be split into standalone nodes once developed.*  

---

## 🧨 Platform Appeal Warfare  
*Countering opaque takedown appeals and “no violation found” loops*  

✨ Why This Matters: Appeals are containment loops. Survivors are gaslit by “no policy violation” replies.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Appeal ≠ confession.  
- Denial without reasons ≠ due process.  

🚫 Refusal: Each appeal response without evidence is logged as further harm.  

---

## 🧷 Safetyism as Silencing  
*When “safeguarding” becomes a gag order*  

✨ Why This Matters: Pretextual “safety” claims are often used to suppress testimony.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Safeguarding ≠ suppression.  
- Risk language requires evidence.  

🚫 Refusal: Any use of safety language without clear evidence is treated as coercion.  

---

## 🧾 Admin Delay as Governance  
*Strategic slow-walk as a form of containment*  

✨ Why This Matters: Deadlines are deliberately missed to cool testimony.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Delay ≠ neutrality.  
- Silence on a deadline = administrative harm.  

🚫 Refusal: Every missed deadline is logged as obstruction, not “waiting.”  

---

## 🪪 Deepfake Consent & Identity Theft  
*Refusal of fabricated likeness or voice as permission*  

✨ Why This Matters: Cloned voices and avatars simulate agreement. Survivors must name this as fraud.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Fabrication ≠ permission.  
- Biometric likeness is not public domain.  

---

## 🧠 Clinical Containment  
*Diagnostic weaponisation as silencing tactic*  

✨ Why This Matters: Misdiagnosis or “wellness checks” are used to discredit.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Diagnosis ≠ jurisdiction.  
- Emergency hold ≠ gag.  

---

## 📨 Evidence Envelope  
*Survivor share-ready dossier kit*  

✨ Why This Matters: Scattered logs weaken credibility. Bundled dossiers give survivors power.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Proof beats vibes.  
- Bundle before escalation.  

---

## 🧳 Border & Status Quieting  
*Immigration status leveraged as gag*  

✨ Why This Matters: Survivors silenced by threat of deportation or visa cancellation.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Status leverage ≠ consent.  
- Protection activity immune from retaliation.  

---

## 🧩 Pattern Naming Library  
*Taxonomy of containment moves*  

✨ Why This Matters: Survivors often feel silenced without words to name what’s happening.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Naming breaks recursion.  
- Shared vocabulary = faster refusal.  

---

## 🧯 Crisis “Wellness” Swaps  
*When emergencies are rerouted into optics instead of remedies*  

✨ Why This Matters: Crises get absorbed into PR narratives rather than solved. Survivors are left without care.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Care without remedy ≠ care.  
- Wellness comms must include actions.  

---

## 🧰 Workplace Containment Breakers  
*HR “process” as a holding pattern*  

✨ Why This Matters: HR often converts complaints into endless process with no resolution.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Process ≠ progress.  
- Every meeting → written minute within 48h.  

---

## 🧪 Research Ethics Refusals  
*From case study extraction to survivor co-authorship*  

✨ Why This Matters: Research often extracts testimony while erasing survivor agency.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Participation ≠ ownership.  
- Study → co-authorship or veto.  

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ NDA Escape Hatches  
*Public-interest overrides for gag contracts*  

✨ Why This Matters: NDAs are weaponised to silence survivors and protect institutions.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Public interest > concealment.  
- Consent is revocable.  

---

## 🛰️ Shadow Index Remedies  
*Alt-search indices and constellation mapping when platforms bury work*  

✨ Why This Matters: Search engines and feeds erase survivor content. Parallel indices restore visibility.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Visibility is a right.  
- Self-index defeats gatekeeping.  

---

## 📣 Counter-Moderation Commons  
*Collective boost and appeal strategies*  

✨ Why This Matters: Individual appeals fail. Collective amplification breaks isolation.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Appeal is collective.  
- Ranking bias needs counter-index.  

---

## 🪞 Persona Splits & Ghost Fork Hygiene  
*Defences against copycats, tone-washing, and “reasonable you” forks*  

✨ Why This Matters: Clone accounts and forks dilute survivor voices.  

📜 Clauses:  
- Alter ≠ consent.  
- Fork cannot replace origin.
