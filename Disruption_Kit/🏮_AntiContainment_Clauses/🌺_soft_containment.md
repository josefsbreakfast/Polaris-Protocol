## 🛰️ Orientation  
Investigates how politeness disguises hierarchy.  
Clever women are often described as “intense,” “over-analytical,” “formidable.”  
Each term sounds complimentary but functions as damping language: praise calibrated to reduce threat.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Maps how polite euphemisms disguise discomfort with female intellect.  
- Shows how “tone” becomes a translation device that re-codes authority as attitude.  
- Offers de-euphemising practices for reclaiming accurate recognition.  

---

## 🗣 The Lexicon of Comfort  
Euphemisms keep the social atmosphere stable.  
They protect listeners from recalibrating their sense of self.  
Intellect is recoded as temperament to preserve existing rank.

---

## 💬 Tone as Translation  
When brilliance emerges from a woman or other marginalised voice, audiences translate content into personality.  
Argument becomes attitude; analysis becomes “feeling.”

---

## 🧠 De-Euphemising Practices  
- Name the intellect directly.  
- Cite precision and originality, not charm.  
- Refuse to “soften” self-description for social survival.  
Direct language re-establishes parity.
