## 🌹 Purpose  

This folder collects **language, refusal syntax, and metadata clauses** that directly resist containment logics.  
Each file offers a different tactical register:  

- **Narrative Reclamation** → *authorship recovery and reversal declarations*  
- **Survivor Syntax** → *refusal phrases for those misclassified or ghosted*  
- **Metadata Defense** → *forensic sovereignty and data refusal*  
- **Ghost Fork Response** → *analysis of clone behaviour and counter-protocols*  
- **Consent Clauses** → *dismantling the false equivalence of visibility and consent*  
- **Loop Interruption** → *breakouts from recursive throttling and enforced patience*  
- **No Invisible Interference** → *refusal of hidden throttling and sabotage*  
- **Visibility Is a Right** → *counters search erosion and indexing failure*  
- **Ranking Is Not Neutral** → *exposes algorithmic ranking as governance*  
- **Digital Counter-Containment** → *refusal of shadowbans and digital throttling*  
- **Mean vs Evidence Template** → *dual-register countermeasure against cooling*

## 🏮 Footer  

*🏮 AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.  

*Survivors voices must always live on.*
