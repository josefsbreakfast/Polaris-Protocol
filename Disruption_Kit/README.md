# 🧯 Disruption Kit

**Operational field folder for tracking, resisting, and documenting behavioural containment.**  
This kit contains countermeasures, diagnostic logs, survivor tools, and systemic analysis nodes.

It is designed to support both internal clarity and external escalation — enabling others to identify, interpret, and resist metadata-based interference patterns, especially where traditional oversight has failed.

This is a living disruption index.  
Keep it clear. Keep it sharp. Keep it safe.
