# 🛠️ Disruption Kit  

**Purpose:**  
This kit contains operational tools, forensic logs, and diagnostic countermeasures designed to track and disrupt behavioural containment systems.  
Each subfolder targets a distinct layer of resistance, sabotage analysis, and survivor protection.

## 📂 Folder Index  

### **Big_Picture_Protocols/**
Strategic frameworks and meta-analysis nodes. These entries connect individual events to systemic patterns — covering governance logic, narrative manipulation, and cultural containment theory.  
🔗 [Open Folder](./Big_Picture_Protocols)  

### **Containment_Scripts/**
Tactical playbooks and forensic breakdowns of platform or institutional suppression methods.  
Focus: visibility throttling, metric manipulation, and engagement sabotage.  
🔗 [Open Folder](./Containment_Scripts)  

### **Survivor_Tools/**
Survivor-led methods for reclaiming agency and resisting narrative capture.  
Includes practical guides, emotional sovereignty frameworks, and abolitionist survival logic.  
🔗 [Open Folder](./Survivor_Tools)  

### **Field_Logs/** *(Forensic Logs)*
Time-bound, event-specific forensic captures of suppression behaviour, metadata anomalies, and live operational breaches.  
Entries often include screenshots, timestamps, and immediate interpretive notes.  
Key series: **Suppression Watch – Aug 2025**

## 🧭 How to Use  
1. **Identify the layer** of your situation: strategic (big picture), tactical (containment), personal (survivor tools), or chronological (forensic logs).  
2. **Cross-reference nodes** — many entries link across categories.  
3. **Log evidence immediately** — screenshots, timestamps, and source links preserve the forensic chain.
