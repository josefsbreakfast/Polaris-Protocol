# 🪄 Disruption Kit  
**First created:** 2025-08-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-15  
*Operational tools, forensic logs, and countermeasures for resisting behavioural containment.*  

---

## ✨ Purpose  
The **Disruption Kit** contains operational tools, forensic logs, and diagnostic countermeasures designed to track and disrupt behavioural containment systems.  
Each subfolder targets a distinct layer of resistance, sabotage analysis, and survivor protection.  

---

## 🛰️ Folder Index  

### [Big Picture Protocols](./Big_Picture_Protocols)  
Strategic frameworks and meta-analysis nodes.  
These entries connect individual events to systemic patterns — covering governance logic, narrative manipulation, and cultural containment theory.  

---

### [Containment Scripts](./Containment_Scripts)  
Tactical playbooks and forensic breakdowns of platform or institutional suppression methods.  
Focus areas: visibility throttling, metric manipulation, and engagement sabotage.  

---

### [AntiContainment Clauses](./AntiContainment_Clauses)  
Explicit refusal scripts and carve-outs designed to block or undo containment logics.  
These clauses act as counter-contracts: asserting survivor sovereignty against coercive frames and institutional choke points.  

---

### [Survivor Tools](./Survivor_Tools)  
Survivor-led methods for reclaiming agency and resisting narrative capture.  
Includes practical guides, emotional sovereignty frameworks, and abolitionist survival logic.  

---

### [Field Logs](./Field_Logs)  
Time-bound, event-specific forensic captures of suppression behaviour, metadata anomalies, and live operational breaches.  
Entries often include screenshots, timestamps, and immediate interpretive notes.  

**Key series:** Suppression Watch – Aug 2025

## 🧭 How to Use  
1. **Identify the layer** of your situation:  
   - Strategic → Big Picture Protocols  
   - Tactical → Containment Scripts  
   - Personal → Survivor Tools  
   - Chronological → Field Logs  

2. **Cross-reference nodes** — many entries link across categories.  

3. **Log evidence immediately** — screenshots, timestamps, and source links preserve the forensic chain.
