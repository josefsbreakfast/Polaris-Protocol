# 🛠️ Disruption Kit  

**Purpose:**  
This kit contains operational tools, forensic logs, and diagnostic countermeasures designed to track and disrupt behavioural containment systems.

## 🧭 How to Use  
1. **Identify the layer** of your situation: strategic (big picture), tactical (containment), or personal (survivor tools).  
2. **Cross-reference nodes** — many entries link across categories.  
3. **Log evidence immediately** — screenshots, timestamps, and source links preserve the forensic chain.
