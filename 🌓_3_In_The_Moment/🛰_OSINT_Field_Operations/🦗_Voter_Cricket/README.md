# 🦗 Voter Cricket: Election Audit & Behavioural Oversight  
**First created:** 2025-10-19 | **Last updated:** 2026-05-21  
*Citizen-led infrastructure for auditing electoral data use, behavioural targeting, and democratic integrity in the UK.*  

---

## Scope  
The **Election Audit & Behavioural Oversight** suite is a living toolkit within the *Polaris Protocol’s System Governance series*.  
It consolidates methods, templates, and field nodes for investigating:  
- how behavioural data are used in campaigns,  
- how socio-economic neglect shapes voter vulnerability, and  
- how parties manage “safe seats” and candidate substitutions.  

This cluster equips journalists, civic researchers, and local citizens to conduct reproducible, evidence-based audits of electoral integrity.

## Component Overview  

| Node | Function |
|------|-----------|
| **🧭 Citizen Audit — Behavioural Data in Elections** | Field guide for open-source auditing of data and behavioural targeting at constituency level. |
| **🧩 Socio-Economic Clusters of Reform Support** | Analytical map of civic neglect and economic vulnerability driving new-right traction. |
| **🧭 Stronghold Capture Audit** | Framework for testing ideological or representational drift in historically safe seats. |
| **📮 FOI Bundle** | Template letters for boundary, register, and service-budget disclosure. |
| **🧮 Data Templates** | Standardised CSV schemas for consistency and reproducibility. |
| **audit_loader.py** | Lightweight Python tool to triage risk flags and summarise regional patterns. |

## How to Use the Toolkit  

1. **Choose Your Audit Type**  
   - 🧭 *Citizen Audit* → behavioural data and targeting.  
   - 🧩 *Reform Cluster* → socio-economic neglect patterns.  
   - 🧭 *Stronghold Capture* → representational drift within safe seats.  

2. **Pull Baseline Data**  
   - Electoral Commission returns, Boundary Commission maps, ONS datasets, and FOI responses (use 📮 templates).  

3. **Record Findings**  
   - Use the matching CSV template in `/data_templates/`.  
   - Save all FOI replies, screenshots, or documents in `/evidence/`.  

4. **Run Automated Checks**  
   - Execute:  
     ```bash
     python tools/audit_loader.py --csv your_audit.csv --outdir results/
     ```  
   - Review `summary.md` for quick triage of High / Medium / Low-risk indicators.  

5. **Interpret & Publish**  
   - Use nodes as interpretive frameworks, not accusation documents.  
   - Publish aggregated findings or pattern analysis with transparency notes.

## OSINT Ethics Charter  

1. **Transparency over speculation.** Cite every dataset and FOI number.  
2. **Aggregate, don’t expose.** Never publish personal data or voter identities.  
3. **Neutral framing.** Describe patterns; avoid attributing motive without evidence.  
4. **Civic return.** Share findings with local councils, watchdogs, or academic partners.  
5. **Versioning.** Mark every update and data-revision date clearly.  

---

## Future Extensions  

- Automated ingestion of Electoral Commission open APIs.  
- GIS mapping overlay (Python + GeoJSON).  
- Plug-in architecture for `audit_loader.py` to parse Stronghold-specific flags.  
- Multi-party comparative dashboards for narrative-alignment detection.
