# 🪬 Violence Against Jews and the Yom Kippur Fixation  
**First created:** 2025-10-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-02  
*The long and unglamorous history of extremist violence on Jewish communities, and why Yom Kippur is chosen as a stage for desecration.*

## ⚠️ Recognition  

On Yom Kippur 2025, two worshippers were murdered outside a synagogue in Manchester. A third person died when police opened fire.  

At the time of writing, details remain under investigation. But what is clear is this: violence on Yom Kippur is not aberration. It is continuity. Far-right extremists, pogromists, and Nazis have long chosen sacred time to inflict maximum desecration and pain.  

No one deserves to die by murder — not worshippers, not bystanders, not even perpetrators. Murder is not justice.

## 📜 Historical Patterns  

Antisemitic violence has often clustered around holy days. The perpetrators knew when Jews would be most visible, most gathered, most vulnerable. They struck then.  

- **Pogroms in the Russian Empire** often coincided with festivals.  
- **Hep-Hep riots (Bavaria, 1819)** erupted after emancipation, punishing Jews for citizenship.  
- **Kishinev pogrom (1903)** killed 49 and became a propaganda template: Jews cast as “agitators” even in their own destruction.  
- **Post-imperial pogroms (1917–1920)** across Austria-Hungary, Galicia, and Ukraine killed tens of thousands, framed as punishment for “Judeo-Bolshevism.”  

The Holocaust did not come from nowhere. It built on a century of pogrom logic, already well-practised in targeting Jews at their moments of visibility.

## 🕯️ Yom Kippur Under the Holocaust  

- **Łódź Ghetto, 1940 (Oct 9)**  
  Jews gathered in a makeshift synagogue were assaulted by Nazi troops and ghetto police. A **blood-stained tallit fragment** later recovered from the site bears witness to desecration on the holiest day.  

- **Babi Yar, 1941 (Sept 29–30)**  
  SS orders to assemble Kyiv’s Jews were issued on Yom Kippur. Over 33,000 were murdered at Babi Yar — one of the largest mass shootings of the Holocaust.  

- **Warsaw Ghetto, 1942 (Sept 21)**  
  Yom Kippur marked the **final day** of the Great Deportation to Treblinka. Tens of thousands were denied the chance to fast, pray, or be inscribed in the Book of Life.  

- **Clandestine observance**  
  Despite prohibitions, Jews whispered prayers in barracks, smuggled siddurim, and fasted in starvation. In Parschnitz camp (1944), Livia Koralek preached a Yom Kippur sermon to fellow prisoners. In Lodz, a clandestine YK service was photographed in 1941.

## 🧩 Survivor Testimonies  

- **Miriam Shevet (Northern Greece, 1941)** described Bulgarian reprisals that coincided with Yom Kippur as *“our black Yom Kippur.”* Though most victims were Greeks, she named the day as the only language vast enough to contain the massacre.  

- Survivors across ghettos and camps recalled **Nazi mockery**: offering extra rations on the fast day, intensifying labour, or timing raids to Yom Kippur — deliberate humiliation through desecration.  

- For many, Yom Kippur became a site of theological fracture: *why seek God’s forgiveness when annihilation was upon us?* Some lost faith, others held more tightly. Observance itself became an act of defiance.

## 🪬 Modern Echoes  

- **Halle, Germany (2019)**  
  On Yom Kippur, a neo-Nazi attempted to storm a synagogue with 52 worshippers inside. Armed with eight firearms and explosives, he failed to breach the entrance. He murdered a woman outside the synagogue, then drove to a kebab restaurant where he murdered a young man he believed to be Muslim. Convicted in 2020 of two murders and 68 attempted murders, his actions revealed the same logic: one hatred, many targets.  

- **Charleston, USA (2015)**  
  Dylann Roof murdered nine Black worshippers during Bible study in a historic church.  

- **Christchurch, New Zealand (2019)**  
  A white supremacist massacred 51 Muslims during Friday Jumʿah prayers.  

The pattern is constant: extremists strike when communities are most visible in sacred time and space.  

---

## 📣 Language and Suppression  

- Media framing rarely calls white supremacist attacks “terrorism” immediately, even when they are ideologically motivated and designed to terrorise.  
- Selective quoting of manifestos hides the tactical logic — the choice of sacred days is erased.  
- Online, searches for “Yom Kippur violence” are redirected to the Yom Kippur War or October 7th, burying Holocaust-era desecrations. This is **denial by suppression**: not screaming “it never happened,” but quietly removing it from sight.  

---

## 🕸️ Continuity of Perpetrator Behaviour  

From pogromists in Bavaria to Nazis in Lodz, from Halle to Manchester, the logic is the same:  
- Strike on sacred days.  
- Attack Jews, Muslims, Black congregants — anyone marked as “foreign.”  
- Repeat until it looks like doctrine, because it is.  

---

## 🕯️ Kaddish  

We say Kaddish for those killed in Manchester on Yom Kippur 2025, and for those killed on the same day in Lodz, Kyiv, Warsaw, and Halle.  

Sacred time has been desecrated again and again. Suppression cannot erase it; perpetrators repeat themselves too clearly.  

To name the pattern is to resist it. To say Kaddish is to remember not only the murdered, but the continuity of violence that binds them.
