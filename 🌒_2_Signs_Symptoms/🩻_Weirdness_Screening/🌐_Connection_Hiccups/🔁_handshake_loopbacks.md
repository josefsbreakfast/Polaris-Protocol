# 🔁 Handshake Loopbacks  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2026-05-19  
*Authentication refresh cycles that trap users in infinite reconnects*

---

## Purpose  

Capture recurring “session expired”, “token invalid”, or “re-authenticate” messages that prevent stable access.  
Serves as bridge between Connection Hiccups and Access Barriers, signalling possible man-in-the-middle filtering or credential throttling.

---

## Evidence to Record  

- Service name + exact error string  
- Sequence of prompts (login, MFA, redirect loop)  
- Session length before drop  
- Packet capture or HAR file if available  
- Screenshot of repeating login sequence

It documents containment tactics hidden behind authentication refreshes and false session expiries.
