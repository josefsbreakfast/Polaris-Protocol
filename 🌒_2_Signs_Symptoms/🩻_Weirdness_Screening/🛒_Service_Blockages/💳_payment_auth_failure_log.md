# 💳 Payment Auth Failure Log
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2026-05-19  
*Transaction denials and inexplicable reversals across processors.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
Capture payment‑layer behavior: approvals, soft/hard declines, 3‑DS loops, and reversals that lack a valid cause code.

---

## 🌱 Purpose
- Differentiate bank‑side vs merchant‑side denials.  
- Spot metadata‑driven filtering (postcode, device fingerprint, commodity class).

---

## 🧪 Minimal Record (YAML front‑matter)
```yaml

site: "RetailerY.app"
amount: 29.99

## 🧾 Log Template
| when (UTC) | site | amount | currency | method | processor | result | code/text | step | artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  | soft decline / hard decline / reversal |  | pre‑auth / 3‑DS / capture |  |

> Where possible request **auth/correlation IDs** and note them verbatim.

---

## 🧩 Differentiators
- Same card succeeds for small basket but fails for survival/activism SKUs.  
- Declines by postcode/VPN, passes on mobile data.  
- Repeated *"do not honor"* without issuer explanation.
