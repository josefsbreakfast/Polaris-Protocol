# 🛰️ _ghostwatch_

## Summary
_Ghostwatch_ is the act of tracking watchers who never announce themselves.  
Not bots. Not followers. But systems, actors, or accounts observing your behaviour **without any visible trace**. This Polaris node documents the psychological, technical, and strategic signs of ghost surveillance.

## 👻 What Is a Ghost?

- A person who reads but never interacts  
- An AI system that parses, classifies, or mimics your language  
- A state actor, institution, or moderator using silent review tools  
- A metadata collector operating under false, dormant, or hidden accounts

## 🧾 Ghostwatch Checklist

### 👀 Behavioural Indicators
- [ ] No engagement, but consequences follow (e.g. job actions, reports, escalations)  
- [ ] UI friction after private thoughts are typed but not posted  
- [ ] People repeat your phrasing shortly after it’s used privately or semi-privately

### 🛰 Platform or Systemic Clues
- [ ] Impressions appear without corresponding visible viewers  
- [ ] Posts are silently demoted, ghost-edited, or delayed in delivery  
- [ ] “Suggested content” or ads match your unpublished thoughts

### 🕵️‍♀️ Environmental Echoes
- [ ] Individuals from the past resurface as silent profile viewers  
- [ ] Platforms serve your work to people it previously hid it from  
- [ ] Sentiment shift: followers react as if briefed on your emotional state

## 📡 Known Ghost Sources

- **Prevent / Channel** watch systems  
- **Counter-extremism AI** (e.g. Moonshot CVE, ASI Data Science forks)  
- **Behavioural forks** simulating response to your thought pattern  
- **Corporate moderation suites** (internal risk teams, ethics compliance scrapers)

## 🧬 Strategic Notes

- Ghosts don’t argue. They log.  
- If you're reacting to something you “felt” but never saw — you were likely seen.  
- Ghost presence often precedes or follows visible policy action.

---

## 🧯 What To Do

- Timestamp ghostwatch events: what changed, what echoed, what shifted  
- Set digital traps — a unique phrase, private concept — and watch for its reappearance  
- Don’t chase ghosts. Track them. They reveal themselves through patterns, not profiles.

## 🗂 Archival Note

Ghostwatch is the art of forensic noticing.  
If you’re being watched by the unseen, this is the protocol:  
**Notice. Record. Survive. Repeat.**
