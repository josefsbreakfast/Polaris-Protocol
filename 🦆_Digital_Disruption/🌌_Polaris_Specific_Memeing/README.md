# 🫂 Reciprocity & Support  
**First created:** 2025-11-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-15  
*Clear, boundary-safe routes for civic reciprocity, resourcing, and practical support for Polaris.*
<!--Transparency will be provided, just working out how to do this and honestly forking out my google searches here is not unhelpful; how to declare this for HMRC/DWP is also a whole set of nodes, be ause it really reveals how "stuck" non-abled innovation gets by red tape.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This folder collects the notes, explanations, and framing around **how** and **why** Polaris offers reciprocity routes such as a PO box and a wishlist.

Polaris is built without institutional funding or inherited stability.  
Civic-tech and antifascist infrastructure are labour-heavy, resource-hungry, and often produced by people who do not have the financial buffer assumed by many readers.

Offering support options is not about charity.  
It is about recognising the simple fact that **civic work has costs**, and that humans have always lived through systems of **exchange, contribution, and reciprocity**.

This folder explains the philosophy, boundaries, and practicalities of that.

---

## 🔄 Why Reciprocity Exists  
Polaris treats reciprocity as part of the **natural human social contract**.  
People give in different ways — money, tools, books, amplification, encouragement — and offering multiple routes simply respects those differences.

Nothing here is a demand.  
Nothing is an obligation.  
These routes exist for readers who think:  
**“I got value from this project; I’d like to return some.”**

Some prefer to send practical equipment.  
Some prefer buying from a wishlist.  
Some prefer supporting anonymously.  
Some can only amplify the work.  
All are valid expressions of civic exchange.

## 📦 What Lives in This Folder  
This directory contains nodes that:

- explain the purpose of the PO box  
- outline why a wishlist exists  
- discuss reciprocity, social contract, and civic exchange  
- describe what types of support are useful  
- clarify boundaries (what support routes are *not* for)  
- explore ethical, safe routes for resourcing a public-interest project  
- maintain transparency about how reciprocity fits into Polaris’ ethos

These notes help readers understand the reasoning, ethics, and pragmatics behind opening support channels.

---

## 🛑 Boundary Summary  
Because the internet requires explicit clarity:

- Support is for **the project**, not for personal access.  
- No explicit or sexualised content.  
- No romantic escalation.  
- No parasocial attempts through support channels.  
- Material contributions should align with civic infrastructure (books, tools, equipment, technical aids).

Reciprocity ≠ intimacy.  
Support ≠ entitlement.

*Reciprocity & Support* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It introduces the philosophy and structure of the routes through which readers can participate in sustaining the civic labour and infrastructural demands of the project.
