*An analogue doorway for correspondence, care, and transparent civic exchange.*  
<!--The clock for how long it takes for this to go wrong starts now. Please can someone send the print-offs for the IPT before thos happens?-->

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This is the **official Polaris mail box**.  
It exists so that people who prefer analogue channels — letters, postcards, paper guidance, thoughtful notes — have a safe way to send them.

This PO Box operates as:

- a protected, non-residential mailing route  
- a civic correspondence channel  
- an input vector for research materials, handwritten messages, and printed advice  
- a boundary-safe mechanism that keeps physical address information private  

Everything received will be logged transparently in the  
**🛒 Correspondence & Items Received** ledger.

Even postcards will be declared if required.  
Governance literacy is part of the work.

## ✉️ Address Format  
Please use the exact layout below when writing:

**The Snail Box**  
**PO Box 11461**  
**NOTTINGHAM**  
**NG1 9RQ**  

This is a Royal Mail **P.O. Box Direct Delivery** service.  
Mail is forwarded securely; senders never see a residential address.  
Please print clearly, avoid glitter bombs, and do not send cash or valuables.

## 📜 What You *May* Send  
- Letters  
- Postcards  
- Paper notes  
- Printed guidance (tax, accounting, benefits, compliance — TTS-friendly if possible)  
- Flat documents such as diagrams, charts, or articles  
- Accessible summaries of complex bureaucratic rules (these are treasured)

If in doubt:  
**paper = safe.**  

If you want Brownie Points?  

Postcards are the easiest because they are lightweight and they cannot rationally be held as long for "checking" that I'm not some unhinged political dissident.

## 🚫 What You *May Not* Send  
These rules protect both you and Polaris:

1. **No parcels or boxes.**  
   The system is letters-only for now, for safety and predictability.

2. **No cash, vouchers, or gift cards.**  
   UK *Proceeds of Crime Act* + DWP overpayment logic = paperwork hell.

3. **No food, biological material, powders, liquids, electronics, USBs, or anything that beeps.**  
   Royal Mail will intercept these and ask questions nobody wants to answer.

4. **No explicit content, no harassment, no threats.**  
   These will be archived and escalated if needed.

5. **No personal data dumps.**  
   Please do not post identity documents, legal evidence, or confidential material.  
   Use secure digital channels for anything sensitive.

6. **No live accountants.**  
   (If you know a consenting accountant who enjoys transparency, please *email them the link* instead.)

## 🧾 Transparency & Compliance  
Any correspondence received here will be:

- logged publicly in the **Correspondence & Items Received** node  
- declared to **HMRC** and **DWP** when thresholds require it  
- archived where appropriate  
- used as part of a broader study into disabled-bureaucracy burdens in the UK

This is part of Polaris’ stance on **structural transparency**.  
We demand it of institutions; we model it ourselves.

Current status:

- No mail received yet.  
- No declarations required yet.  
- Spreadsheets will be created when thresholds are met.  

Paperwork will be handled honestly, even when it is absurd.  

(Especially then.)  

Although if my eyes have to focus on black lettering on white sheets?  

50/50.

## 📮 Safety Notes (Royal Mail Basics)  
Royal Mail may inspect or withhold items that violate the *Postal Services Act 2000*.  
Suspicious mail may be passed to Royal Mail Security or to police.  

Return addresses are optional.  
If you want a reply, please make them legible.

---

## 🌱 Ethos  
The mail box is a **counterweight to digital overwhelm**.  
Slow correspondence is a form of care.  
A postcard can be a small act of resistance, a gesture of civility, or simply a reminder that humour survives everything.

Good manners are the only required postage.
