# 🛒 Correspondence & Items Received  
**First created:** 2025-11-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-15  
*A transparent, real-time ledger of all correspondence and items received through the Polaris PO box and registry routes.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node functions as the **public ledger** for all items or correspondence received via:

- the Data Drift Wedding Registry  
- the Polaris PO box  
- posted letters  
- postcards (yes, even those — especially those)  
- envelopes containing printed guidance  
- parcels of any kind

Polaris holds institutions to standards of transparency.  
This ledger models the same principle:  
**if something arrives, it is logged.**

This is also part of a broader research interest into the bureaucratic and compliance structures that disabled people navigate in the UK, especially those inherited from welfare surveillance and eugenics-era systems.

Everything here will be declared to HMRC and DWP where required.

## 📊 Incoming Correspondence & Items Log  
This log will update as items arrive.

| Date Received | Correspondence Type | Item / Description | Approx. Value | Source (Registry / PO Box) | Notes |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Correspondence Type** examples:  
- Letter  
- Postcard  
- Envelope  
- Parcel  
- Book  
- Equipment item  
- Printed guidance  
- “Misc.” (ideally used sparingly)

> 🟦 **Status Note:**  
> As of the last update, no items have yet been received.  
> This log will be updated transparently as soon as anything arrives.

## 🧾 Compliance & Transparency  
Any item listed in this ledger will be:

- **declared to HMRC and DWP** as required  
- assessed for its relevance to current thresholds  
- documented for future reference  
- included in spreadsheets when those become necessary

This is not self-surveillance.  
It is **principled transparency**, and it exposes the scale of bureaucratic scrutiny that disabled people are expected to maintain.

Polaris exists partly to reveal that structure.

## 📮 What Counts as Correspondence?  
Everything.

- Letters  
- Postcards  
- Books  
- Cables  
- Tools  
- Printed tax advice  
- A postcard with a drawing of a seagull eating chips  
- A polite note saying “good luck”  
- A practical piece of kit  
- A reminder of the world’s feral benevolence  

If it transits through the public support vector,  
**it gets logged**.

---

## 🛑 Boundary Notes  
For ethical and safety clarity:

- No explicit or sexualised items  
- No attempts at personal contact escalation  
- No parasocial backchannels  
- No harmful or hateful content  
- Do not send anything alive, edible, or combustible (not even an accountant)  
- Do not attempt to mail a human accountant (Royal Mail disagrees)

Correspondence ≠ access.  
Receipt ≠ relationship.  
Transparency ≠ permission.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Correspondence & Items Received* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maintains a transparent ledger of all incoming support, documents the realities of UK compliance systems, and models the governance standards Polaris advocates.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
