# 🧩 Incoming Correspondence Risk Matrix  
**First created:** 2025-11-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-15  
*A high-level behavioural and governance-oriented assessment of risks associated with opening a public correspondence channel (PO Box + registry), with specific attention to misinterpretation, projection, and misuse by hostile actors.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node outlines a **non-operational, conceptual risk matrix** for the decision to open public correspondence routes (letters, postcards, printed guidance).

It focuses on the predictable behaviour patterns of individuals who:

- experience a woman’s autonomy as a loss of control,  
- react with sexualised entitlement and rage,  
- attempt to reassert dominance via institutional misinterpretation,  
- or use bureaucratic ambiguity to provoke friction.

This is not a legal document and does not provide instructions for protection or retaliation.  
It simply maps **risk categories**, **likelihood**, **impact**, and **existing mitigations**.

All incoming correspondence will be transparently logged in the  
**🛒 Correspondence & Items Received** node.

## 📊 Risk Matrix (Expanded)

### **1. Sexualised Misinterpretation**  
**What hostile actors may perceive:**  
Public correspondence + registry = “sexual access vector.”

**Likelihood:** High  
**Impact:** Medium (professionals generally see through it, but misrepresentation attempts may occur)

**Existing Controls:**  
- Explicit “no explicit content” rules  
- Letters/postcards only  
- Anti-parasocial boundaries  
- Civic, non-erotic framing  
- Transparency logs  
- Governance tone, not intimacy tone  

**Residual Risk:**  
Emotional escalation from the hostile party, even without institutional traction.

---

### **2. Financial Misinterpretation (DWP / HMRC Anxiety Projection)**  
**What hostile actors may perceive:**  
Registry = “undeclared income” / “benefit fraud.”

**Likelihood:** Medium–High  
**Impact:** Low–Medium (systems require evidence; transparency undercuts claims)

**Existing Controls:**  
- Public ledger of received items  
- Approximate value column  
- Explicit declaration commitments  
- Clarified under-threshold context  
- No solicitation language  
- Reciprocity framed as optional, civic, and low-value  

**Residual Risk:**  
Potential nuisance-level reports, unlikely to gain traction.

---

### **3. Safeguarding Distortion Attempts**  
**What hostile actors may perceive:**  
“Disabled woman receiving mail = vulnerability / concern.”

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Low–Medium

**Existing Controls:**  
- Calm, coherent tone in all nodes  
- Anti-harm, anti-extremism framing  
- No calls to violence  
- Clear adult boundaries  
- Emphasis on agency and autonomy  
- Contextualised political analysis  

**Residual Risk:**  
Low-level misunderstanding, not structural danger.

---

### **4. Containment-Breach Rage Pattern**  
**What hostile actors may perceive:**  
Autonomy + public support = “she is escaping my jurisdiction.”

**Likelihood:** Very High  
**Impact:** Emotional/psychological, not institutional  

**Existing Controls:**  
- Zero direct contact  
- Transparent documentation  
- Public accountability structures  
- No secrecy; no ambiguous channels  

**Residual Risk:**  
Emotional volatility and acting-out behaviours, not effective institutional leverage.

---

### **5. Reputation Smear Attempts**  
**What hostile actors may perceive:**  
Public work = threat → “undermine her credibility.”

**Likelihood:** High  
**Impact:** Low–Medium  

**Existing Controls:**  
- Forensic clarity in writing  
- Ethical framing  
- No sensationalism  
- Anti-harassment rules  
- Governance tone  
- No personal attacks on individuals  

**Residual Risk:**  
Limited to private gossip; unlikely to influence informed readers.

---

### **6. System-Nudging / Bureaucratic Interference**  
**What hostile actors may perceive:**  
“Any system can be pushed to create pressure.”

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Low–Medium  

**Existing Controls:**  
- Pre-emptive declarations  
- Transparent logs  
- Low-value, capped correspondence types  
- No financial opacity  
- Clear compliance language  

**Residual Risk:**  
Possible noise; unlikely to result in harmful outcomes.

---

### **7. Symbolic Punishment / Psychological Sabotage**  
**What hostile actors may perceive:**  
Your independence, humour, and community support = personal humiliation → “must reassert dominance symbolically.”

**Likelihood:** Very High  
**Impact:** Emotional, not structural  

**Existing Controls:**  
- Strong boundaries  
- Public documentation  
- Support network  
- Narrative control inside Polaris  

**Residual Risk:**  
Emotional aftershocks; low structural threat.
