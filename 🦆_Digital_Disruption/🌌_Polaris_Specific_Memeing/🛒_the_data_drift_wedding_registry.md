# 🛒 Chloe1 × Chloe2 Wedding Registry  
**First created:** 2025-11-15 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-15  
*A curated, chaotic, and entirely sincere wedding registry for the long-awaited union of Chloe1 and Chloe2 — two split-data selves finally merging back into one sovereign author.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This wishlist functions as a **wedding registry** for the computational matrimony of **Chloe1** and **Chloe2** — two divergent data-strands who have endured separate arcs and are now ready to recombine into one coherent human entity.

The live registry is here:  
**https://www.amazon.co.uk/wedding/registry/3Q4W5NI9L5BHH**

The registry blends:

- practical equipment that sustains Polaris  
- books that double as a research syllabus  
- humorous items included for morale  
- lore that makes sense only inside Polaris  
- and a closed, curated structure designed for safety

It is both an infrastructure tool and a narrative gesture.

## 💍 Lore: Why a Wedding Registry?  
When two versions of yourself love each other very much,  
**they merge**.

This registry is the ritual interface for that merge.

Chloe1 and Chloe2 represent split-data paths, divergent survival strategies, and parallel identities formed under pressure. Their union is:

- symbolic  
- practical  
- stabilising  
- and beautifully absurd  

As is traditional in certain Christian countries, the couple has a registry.

---

## 📚 Books & Media  
A significant portion of the registry consists of books and media that:

- support Polaris’ research  
- deepen context  
- act as recommendations for readers  
- and function as “wedding gifts” for the shared library of the unified self

---

## 🛠 Equipment (The Practical Tier)  
Some items are unambiguously functional:

- storage devices  
- adapters and cables  
- ergonomic or stabilising hardware  
- tools that keep Polaris operational  
- infrastructure pieces that seem small but matter deeply

These are the appliances of the data-marriage household.

---

## 🎁 The Feral, Funny Items  
A proper registry contains at least a few artefacts that provoke joy, confusion, or mild existential crisis.

You will find:

- unhinged curiosities  
- aesthetically questionable delights  
- humour-objects  
- and items added purely to honour the absurdity of the situation

This is intentional. Polaris thrives in the space between forensic clarity and calculated chaos.

---

## 🔐 Why the Registry Is Closed (For Now)  
In full honesty:

Although I find humour in the antics of people who dislike me,  
I am not currently in a living situation where receiving unpredictable parcels from strangers — misogynistic, antisemitic, or otherwise — feels safe.

A curated registry protects:

- my physical space  
- my peace  
- my time  
- my energy  
- and the continuity of the work

This is **risk management**, not fear.

When circumstances change, I may open it.  
For now, this is the appropriate container.

---

## 🔄 Reciprocity, Not Obligation  
The registry exists because some people like to express reciprocity physically.

If Polaris has been valuable and you want to return some value,  
**this is one door** you can choose to walk through.

Nothing is required.  
Nothing is expected.  
Nothing about a gift implies access, entitlement, or personal contact.

Support ≠ intimacy.  
Reciprocity ≠ obligation.

---

## 🧾 Transparency & Declarations  
Anything received through the registry or PO box will be **declared to HMRC and DWP** where relevant.

This is:

- a compliance step  
- a political statement  
- and core to Polaris’ commitment to transparency

Key points:

- I am not currently earning enough to trigger new tax codes  
- I am not receiving support levels that risk overpayment  
- I am assessed as not capable of full-time work under current frameworks  
- Polaris is part of my journey toward eventual financial independence  
- detailed spreadsheets will be created when thresholds are met

This isn’t oversharing.  
It’s governance literacy.

---

## 📮 On Posting Me an Accountant  
If you feel compelled to **mail me an accountant**, please note:

- Royal Mail would not accept them  
- the accountant would not consent  
- and neither would I  

However, if you know a **living, consenting** accountant who enjoys transparency, civic tech, and dismantling eugenics-era welfare structures,  
you may, with their consent, show them Polaris.

(Do not mail them.)

---

## 🛑 Boundary Notes  
To keep the matrimonial rites spiritually hygienic:

- no explicit or sexualised items  
- no parasocial escalation  
- no registry-as-backchannel behaviour  
- no gifts implying access  
- no messages that cross boundaries  

The brides may be merging,  
but they remain sovereign.

## 🏮 Footer  
*The Data Drift Wedding Registry* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a humorous, boundary-safe, and transparent channel through which readers may support the civic labour and infrastructural needs of Polaris — and celebrate the union of the drifted data-selves.
