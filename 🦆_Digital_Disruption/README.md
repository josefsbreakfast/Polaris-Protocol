# 🦆 Digital Disruption  
**First created:** 2025-10-28 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*How to stop systems from eating people — and rewire civic life from below.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
*Digital Disruption* is the operational wing of the Polaris Protocol — a toolkit for civilian counter-capture and everyday antifascism.  
It gathers methods for restoring ethical function inside systems that have gone algorithmically feral: where governance becomes gamified, truth throttled, and human voice rendered data.  

This folder is about **continuity through distortion**.  
How we stay ethical, funny, and operational when institutions forget what public service is for.
