# 🐈‍⬛ Antifascist Propaganda Machine
**First created:** 2025-12-23 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-04  
*Ethical counter-propaganda, systems disruption, and organised friction against authoritarian harm.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This cluster acknowledges a reality we can no longer afford to euphemise:

There **is** a contemporary fascist propaganda machine.
It is organised, adaptive, cross-platform, and increasingly aggressive.
It shapes law, policy, education, health outcomes, and who is allowed to speak.

Ignoring this does not make us ethical.
It makes us ineffective.

This work exists to document that machine — and to develop **ethical, organised, and proportionate ways to interrupt it**.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Position (Read First)

This cluster is grounded in a simple distinction:

**Harming people is fascism.  
Disrupting harmful systems is antifascism.**

### Non-negotiable red lines:
We do **not**:
- target individuals for physical harm
- encourage or incite violence
- doxx, stalk, or terrorise private persons
- fabricate accusations or evidence
- treat people as expendable or irredeemable

### What we explicitly allow and document:
- interruption of coordination and scale
- friction against harmful policy pipelines
- disruption of visibility and amplification
- time-wasting and resource exhaustion of authoritarian systems
- refusal of civility toward openly fascist behaviour
- clear naming of harm without euphemism

Ethics are not politeness.
They are **harm boundaries**.

## 🎯 Why This Shift Is Necessary

Much existing antifascist guidance has focused on:
- interpersonal de-escalation,
- microaggressions,
- family or workplace conversations,
- emotional survival under hostility.

That work still matters.

But it is no longer sufficient.

In the last 1–2 years we have seen:
- coordinated book bans (not isolated challenges),
- legal and bureaucratic capture of education and libraries,
- algorithmic amplification of authoritarian narratives,
- policy regimes designed to restrict what can be read, taught, or said,
- propaganda systems that aim not to persuade, but to **control availability**.

This is not about “winning arguments”.
It is about **controlling the conditions under which arguments are possible**.

That requires organised response.

## 🧿 Fascist Behaviour (Not Fascist Essence)

This project deliberately focuses on **behaviours**, not identities.

We name:
- censorship drives
- dehumanising rhetoric
- dominance framing
- scapegoating
- mythic “order” narratives
- suppression of pluralism
- coordination toward exclusionary control

Why?

Because:
- behaviours can be interrupted,
- behaviours can be abandoned,
- some people *do* disengage once harm is named clearly,
- and the goal is fewer victims, not moral performance.

We are interested in stopping damage — not in freezing people into permanent enemies.

## 🔧 What “Aggression” Means Here

Being more aggressive **does not** mean hurting people.

It means:
- acting with urgency proportional to harm
- refusing false neutrality
- applying sustained pressure to harmful systems
- interrupting momentum before it becomes law
- organising rather than reacting
- spending energy where it reduces downstream damage

This is not rage.
It is **directed friction**.

---

## 🧨 Core Workstreams

- **Propaganda System Analysis**  
  How authoritarian narratives are seeded, amplified, laundered, and normalised.

- **Doctrine of Friction**  
  Tactics that slow, jam, exhaust, or fragment harmful systems without crossing harm lines.

- **Platform & Policy Capture**  
  How control shifts from speech to *availability* (books, curricula, healthcare, media).

- **Counter-Visibility Strategies**  
  When to amplify, when to dilute, when to interrupt, when to refuse engagement entirely.

- **Exit & Reform Windows**  
  Recognising moments where behavioural change is still possible — and when it isn’t.

## 🧭 Intended Use

This material is for people who are done pretending:
- this is accidental,
- this is fringe,
- this is just “discourse”.

It is written to be:
- operationally useful,
- ethically defensible,
- survivable under scrutiny,
- and adaptable as conditions change.
