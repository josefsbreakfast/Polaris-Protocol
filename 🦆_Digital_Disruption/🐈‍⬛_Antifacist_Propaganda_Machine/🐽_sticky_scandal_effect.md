*How a single scandal can permanently destabilise authority and disrupt propaganda momentum.*
<!--Oink, oink.-->

## 🛰️ Orientation

Not all narratives operate through persuasion.

Some operate through **symbolic recoding**.

The *Sticky Scandal Effect* describes how a single, widely recognised scandal can permanently alter how a powerful figure or institution is perceived — regardless of later policy detail, rebuttal, or reputational repair.

This is not about gossip.
It is about **how authority collapses when gravitas becomes unstable**.

---

## 🧠 Core Mechanism

A sticky scandal works because it:

- bypasses rational evaluation
- embeds at the level of imagery and affect
- creates an automatic recall shortcut
- resists erasure through repetition and denial

Once embedded, the scandal becomes an **indexical reference** — a shorthand that reappears without explanation and requires no argument.

The audience does not need to believe the story.
They only need to *remember* it.

---

## 🎭 Why Scandals Outperform Policy Critique

### 1. Gravitas Collapse  
Authoritarian and elite power depends on:
- seriousness
- dignity
- inevitability

A sticky scandal converts these into:
- ridicule
- farce
- contingency

Statements may continue.
Authority does not.

---

### 2. Cognitive Efficiency  
Scandals:
- require minimal processing
- compress complex critique into a single cue
- travel faster than rebuttals

This makes them resilient across platforms and time.

---

### 3. Debunking Resistance  
Attempts to disprove or contextualise the scandal often **reinforce recall**.

People forget the clarification.
They remember the association.

This makes scandal memory unusually durable.

---

## 🐽 The “Oink” Pattern (Minimal Ridicule)

The most effective scandal shorthand is often:
- content-light
- non-specific
- non-accusatory
- infinitely repeatable

A single word, image, or sound can:
- signal compromised authority
- avoid re-litigating details
- bypass moderation and argument entirely

Importantly, this does **not** escalate.
It *closes* the exchange.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

The Sticky Scandal Effect is only ethically defensible when:

- the subject is a powerful public figure or institution
- the scandal is already public and widely reported
- no new allegations are fabricated or embellished
- harm flows upward, not toward private or vulnerable individuals
- repetition does not become harassment or targeting

This is **memory persistence**, not attack.

---

## 🛑 When Not to Use This

Do not deploy scandal shorthand when:

- it targets private individuals
- it substitutes for evidence where none exists
- it escalates toward dehumanisation
- it distracts from urgent harm reduction work
- it becomes the sole mode of engagement

Scandal destabilises authority.
It does not replace governance.

---

## 🧭 Role Within the Antifascist Propaganda Machine

Within this cluster, the Sticky Scandal Effect functions as:

- a **myth-puncture**, not a persuasion tool
- a **status disruptor**, not a call to action
- a **memory anchor** that prevents narrative reset
- a way to make authoritarian seriousness expensive to maintain

It is most effective when paired with:
- feasibility interrogation
- simplicity–complexity sequencing
- refusal of spectacle escalation

## 🧠 Scrutiny Is Not Symmetrical

There is an uncomfortable but important truth in many effective antifascist tactics:

They resemble the same mechanisms women and other marginalised people regularly experience as harassment.

That resemblance is real.
And the difference is **power**.

---

### The Shared Mechanism: Undermining by Trope

What women describe in hostile or male-dominated spaces often looks like this:

- every answer treated as provisional  
- every claim required to justify itself repeatedly  
- questions asked not to learn, but to erode credibility  
- “just asking questions” used as a dominance move  
- exhaustion used as a silencing tactic  

This is **structural undermining**.
It is not neutral inquiry.
It is power exercised downward.

---

### The Critical Distinction: Direction and Function

The ethical difference is not *what the tactic is*.
It is **who it is applied to, and why**.

#### When applied to women or marginalised people:
- targets those with less institutional power  
- substitutes for accountability they do not control  
- aims to make participation unbearable  
- produces silence rather than clarity  

This is harassment masquerading as inquiry.

#### When applied to authoritarian or elite power:
- targets those claiming governing authority  
- demands competence proportional to power claimed  
- replaces unearned deference with scrutiny  
- forces ownership of consequences  

This is **accountability**, not harassment.

Same mechanism.
Opposite function.

---

### Why This Feels Uncomfortable (Even to Allies)

Many liberal norms collapse these situations into a single rule:
> “Questioning is aggression.”

But that rule only works if power asymmetry is ignored.

In practice:
- **power without scrutiny becomes domination**
- **scrutiny without power becomes cruelty**

Ethics depend on direction.

---

### A Practical Ethical Test

The relevant question is not:
> “Am I undermining someone?”

It is:
> **“Am I undermining someone who is claiming the right to rule, control, exclude, or punish others?”**

- If yes → scrutiny is appropriate.  
- If no → stop.

No civility theatre required.

---

### Why This Belongs in Antifascist Praxis

Authoritarian systems rely on:
- deference without competence  
- certainty without logistics  
- authority without accountability  

Persistent feasibility questioning, trope exposure, and admin pressure remove those protections.

Used upward, these tools recalibrate power.
Used downward, they become abuse.

The tactic is not neutral.
The ethics are in the aim.

*Scrutiny is not symmetrical.  
Accountability is not harassment.  
And power is not entitled to comfort.*

*🐽 Sticky Scandal Effect* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how symbolic disruption can destabilise authoritarian authority without violence, fabrication, or escalation.
