# 🌱 Plantseer: The Alt-Right Detection Data Mining Cooperative
**First created:** 2026-01-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*A cooperative OSINT and pattern-detection project for identifying alt-right radicalisation signals without reproducing carceral or surveillance harm.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Plantseer is a cooperative data-mining and analysis initiative designed to **identify early-stage alt-right radicalisation patterns** across public digital spaces — without defaulting to state surveillance, predictive policing, or punitive risk scoring.

It treats extremist drift as a **detectable social process**, not a moral essence or immutable identity.  
The goal is *visibility, literacy, and collective response* — not blacklists.

Plantseer is structured as a **commons-based intelligence project**, owned and governed by its contributors, with strict ethical boundaries around use, disclosure, and downstream action.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Pattern-first detection**: Focus on language shifts, network adjacency, meme migration, and affective tone — not individual profiling.  
- **Cooperative governance**: Member-owned datasets, rotating stewardship, transparent audit trails.  
- **Non-carceral outputs**: Flags trends, vectors, and risk environments rather than “dangerous people.”  
- **OSINT-only inputs**: Publicly observable data, no scraping of private or semi-private spaces.  
- **Harm-aware thresholds**: Explicit red lines preventing repurposing for immigration control, policing, or repression.

---

## 🧿 What Plantseer Looks For  
Plantseer tracks *movement*, not belief.

Typical signals include:
- Meme laundering from overt extremist spaces into “ironic” or lifestyle contexts.  
- Language softening cycles (e.g. slur → euphemism → “just asking questions”).  
- Narrative pivots during political shocks or moral panics.  
- Network bridges between mainstream grievance spaces and extremist hubs.  
- Emotional weather shifts: irony collapse, grievance crystallisation, dehumanisation cues.

No single signal is treated as decisive.  
**Convergence matters. Time matters. Context matters.**

## 🧠 What Plantseer Refuses To Do  
- No individual risk scores.  
- No predictive policing logic.  
- No secret client access.  
- No cooperation with Prevent-style programmes or law enforcement fishing expeditions.  
- No dataset resale.

If a use-case requires secrecy, coercion, or pre-emptive punishment, Plantseer does not support it.

---

## 🐝 Cooperative Structure  
- **Membership-based participation** with contributor charters.  
- **Rotating analysis cells** to prevent epistemic capture.  
- **Ethics veto power** held by non-technical members.  
- **Forkability by design**: hostile capture results in immediate, legitimate forks.

The cooperative assumes that **analysis itself can radicalise analysts** if unchecked — so governance is part of the safety model.

---

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Posture  
Plantseer operates under:
- OSINT legality norms.  
- Data minimisation by default.  
- Explicit refusal of biometric inference.  
- Auditability of methodology and exclusions.

The project documents *how* conclusions are reached, not just *what* they are.

Opacity is treated as a risk factor.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Plantseer* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It contributes a cooperative, harm-aware approach to extremist pattern detection without reproducing surveillance-state logics or institutional abuse.
