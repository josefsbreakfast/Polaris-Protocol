# 🌱 Commons Charter Generator  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*Portable cooperative charter framework for civic and digital commons.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node provides a **generative charter framework** for groups stewarding shared resources — digital, civic, cultural, or hybrid.  
It treats charters not as frozen constitutions but as **living promises**: revisable, accountable, and emotionally coherent.

The Commons Charter Generator is designed for environments where:
- Trust has been previously broken or exploited  
- Power capture is a known risk  
- Participants may be asymmetrically resourced, traumatised, or surveilled  

It explicitly rejects “neutral governance” myths.  
All governance encodes values; this framework makes those values **explicit, antifascist, and contestable**.

---

## 🧩 Core Design Principles  

### 1. **Living Commitments, Not Static Law**  
Charters generated through this framework:
- Require periodic renewal or reaffirmation  
- Contain built-in sunset clauses  
- Can be suspended for repair without collapsing the commons  

Governance is treated as *care infrastructure*, not control architecture.

### 2. **Legibility Without Capture**  
The generator balances:
- **External legibility** (law, contracts, funders, regulators)  
- **Internal coherence** (shared norms, care, emotional reality)  

Legal compatibility is provided *without* surrendering narrative or moral sovereignty.

### 3. **Antifascist Accountability by Design**  
Every generated charter embeds:
- Explicit anti-capture clauses  
- Distributed authority  
- Named obligations to protect marginalised participants  

Power concentration is treated as a **failure mode**, not an edge case.

---

## 🧰 Generator Modules  

Each charter is assembled from modular sections.  
Communities may adopt all or select subsets — omissions must be **explicitly named**.

### 🪜 A. Purpose & Scope Module  
Defines:
- What is held in common  
- Who the commons serves (and who it explicitly does not)  
- The harms this commons refuses to reproduce  

Includes prompts to surface hidden assumptions early.

---

### 🤝 B. Membership & Consent Module  
Covers:
- Entry criteria (open, bounded, invitation, affinity-based)  
- Informed consent expectations  
- Exit rights without penalty  

Includes **non-coercion language** and explicit rejection of endurance tests, hazing, or unpaid emotional labour.

---

### 🔄 C. Decision-Making & Rotation Module  
Provides patterns for:
- Role rotation and term limits  
- Distributed decision authority  
- Emergency decisions with post-hoc review  

Default bias: **reversibility over speed**.

---

### 🔍 D. Transparency & Record-Keeping Module  
Defines:
- What must be documented  
- What may remain private  
- Who has access to which records  

Rejects “radical transparency” absolutism; privacy is treated as a collective good.

---

### 🧯 E. Conflict, Repair & Removal Module  
Supplies:
- Clear conflict escalation paths  
- Repair-first processes  
- Conditions under which removal is justified  

Explicitly distinguishes **harm** from **discomfort**, and **accountability** from punishment.

---

### 🛡️ F. Trust Anchor Protocol (Anti-Capture Core)  

The Trust Anchor is a **non-operational guardian function** designed to prevent quiet capture.

It typically:
- Holds no day-to-day power  
- Cannot unilaterally act  
- Can trigger review, pause, or external mediation  

Triggers include:
- Role entrenchment  
- Financial opacity  
- Patterned exclusion  
- Retaliation against dissent  

Think of it as a **circuit breaker**, not a ruler.

---

### ⚖️ G. Legal Interoperability Layer  
Optional adapters for:
- Cooperatives  
- Charities / nonprofits  
- CICs / community trusts  
- Informal associations  

This layer translates the charter *outward* without rewriting it *inward*.

---

## 🧠 Failure Modes This Framework Actively Counters  

- Charters used as PR shields  
- “Founder exceptionalism”  
- Care rhetoric masking extraction  
- Burnout framed as personal weakness  
- Silence mistaken for consent  

If a charter feels impressive but participants feel disposable, the system is already failing.

---

## 🧪 Usage Patterns  

The Commons Charter Generator can be used to:
- Bootstrap new cooperatives  
- Refound damaged organisations  
- Stress-test existing governance  
- Train facilitators in ethical design  
- Provide evidence of good-faith governance in disputes  

It is intentionally **slow**.  
Speed is where capture hides.
