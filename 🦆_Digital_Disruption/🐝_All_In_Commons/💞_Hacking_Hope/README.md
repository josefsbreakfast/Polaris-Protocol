# 💞 Hacking Hope  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*Civil and communal tech practices that turn experimentation into mutual aid, solidarity, and democratic repair.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

*Hacking Hope* documents and nurtures **prosocial civic tech practices** — hackathons, maker challenges, **data cooperatives**, and community-run experiments — that are explicitly oriented toward **mutual aid rather than extraction**.

This node exists to counter a familiar failure mode:  
> civic innovation that borrows the language of solidarity while quietly reproducing competition, surveillance, or elite capture.

Here, hacking is not disruption-for-disruption’s sake.  
It is **collective problem-solving under conditions of constraint**, anchored in care, accountability, and shared ownership.

## 🧰 What Lives Here  

This folder gathers examples, frameworks, and working practices such as:

- **Civic hackathons with binding social commitments**  
  (e.g. no venture capture, community veto rights, shared governance)
- **Maker and challenge formats** designed around *care outcomes*, not demos
- **Data cooperatives** that prioritise collective benefit over optimisation
- **Toolchains for mutual aid**, crisis response, and community self-support
- **Post-event continuity models** so work does not evaporate after applause
- **Failure notes** — when “innovation theatre” collapses into extractive patterns

The emphasis is practical: *what actually helps, what quietly harms, and how to tell the difference*.

## 🧭 Core Principles  

1. **Commons first**  
   Outputs belong to the community by default — legally, practically, and culturally.

2. **Care as a technical constraint**  
   Trauma-aware facilitation, accessibility, and consent are design requirements, not “nice extras”.

3. **Anti-heroic labour models**  
   No saviour narratives; credit is distributed, maintenance is valued.

4. **Refusal is allowed**  
   Communities retain the right to say no — to scale, to publish, to partner, to optimise.

5. **Continuity over spectacle**  
   A small tool that persists beats a flashy prototype that disappears.

## 🗂️ Terminology Note — Data Governance  

This node uses **data cooperative** deliberately.

Several adjacent terms circulate in civic tech spaces; they are *not* interchangeable:

- **Data Cooperative** — *preferred*  
  Member-owned and democratically governed data structures.  
  One-member-one-vote (or equivalent), collective benefit, explicit limits on reuse and extraction.

- **Data Trust**  
  A fiduciary stewardship model where trustees manage data on behalf of a defined group.  
  Strong for public-sector or regulatory contexts; less participatory day-to-day.

- **Data Commons**  
  A broader normative frame emphasising shared access and collective norms.  
  Useful conceptually; often underspecified legally.

- **DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)**  
  Originating in web3 contexts.  
  Can support shared governance, but frequently drifts toward financialisation and exclusion unless tightly constrained.

Where external projects use inconsistent language, this folder treats **data cooperatives** as the anchor term — with trusts or commons referenced only where structurally accurate.

## 🧩 How This Connects  

*Hacking Hope* sits at the intersection of:

- **Digital Disruption** — reclaiming technical practice from coercive systems  
- **All-In Commons** — shared ownership, shared risk, shared benefit  
- **Civic repair** — rebuilding trust through materially useful action  

It complements critique-heavy nodes elsewhere in Polaris by focusing on **constructive counter-practice**: not just naming what’s broken, but rehearsing what works.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Hacking Hope* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents and supports civic tech practices that resist extraction, centre care, and treat solidarity as an engineering requirement rather than a slogan.
