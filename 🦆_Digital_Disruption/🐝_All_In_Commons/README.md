# 🐝 All In Commons  
**First created:** 2025-10-28 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*Cooperative civic infrastructure for a world that still believes in each other.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
*All In Commons* builds the cooperative backbone of the Polaris civic method:  
commons charters, shared governance models, and mutual-aid architectures designed for digital and physical life alike.  

It’s the opposite of capture.  
Where institutions hoard power, the commons redistributes capacity.  
Where systems isolate, the commons federates.

## 🧩 Components  
- **Charter Templates** — shared legal + social blueprints for local use.  
- **Governance Mechanisms** — rotating stewardship, transparency triggers.  
- **Civic Economy Models** — cooperative funding loops, refusal of extractive design.  
- **Mutual Aid Infrastructure** — how to rebuild trust across fragmented platforms.  

The commons is not nostalgic.  
It’s *post-crisis infrastructure for a livable future.*
