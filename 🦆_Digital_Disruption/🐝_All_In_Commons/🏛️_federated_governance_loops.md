# 🏛️ Federated Governance Loops  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*Rotating stewardship and collective decision-making for antifascist commons.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node defines **federated governance loops**: repeatable, rotating decision circuits that allow cooperative systems to coordinate **without collapsing into hierarchy**.

Rather than treating authority as a fixed position, federated loops treat governance as:
- A circulatory system  
- A metabolic process  
- A responsibility that must *move* to remain healthy  

The framework is designed for commons operating across:
- Multiple working groups or pods  
- Digital + physical sites  
- Asymmetric risk, visibility, or labour loads  

It assumes that concentration of power is not an accident — it is the default outcome unless actively interrupted.

---

## 🧠 Core Governance Premises  

1. **Power That Does Not Move Will Harden**  
Static authority inevitably detaches from context, care, and consequence.

2. **Coordination ≠ Control**  
Federation exists to enable cooperation *between* autonomous units, not to overrule them.

3. **Consent Is an Ongoing State, Not a One-Time Vote**  
Legitimacy must be continuously renewed through participation, transparency, and reversibility.

---

## 🧰 Loop Architecture  

Federated governance is implemented through **interlocking loops**, each with defined scope, cadence, and exit paths.

---

### 🔄 A. Stewardship Loop (Operational Rotation)  

Handles:
- Day-to-day coordination  
- Agenda setting  
- External interfaces  

Characteristics:
- Time-limited mandates  
- Mandatory handover notes  
- Cooling-off periods before re-entry  

Stewards hold *responsibility*, not ownership.

---

### 🪜 B. Deliberation Loop (Collective Sensemaking)  

Used for:
- Policy changes  
- Resource allocation  
- Conflict escalation  

Features:
- Consent-based thresholds  
- Minority objection recording  
- Explicit pause-and-repair options  

Silence is logged as absence, not agreement.

---

### 🧭 C. Delegation Loop (Working Group Autonomy)  

Defines how:
- Sub-groups self-govern  
- Decisions are scoped locally  
- Cross-impact is flagged upstream  

Autonomy is presumed by default; intervention must be justified.

---

### 🧯 D. Review & Recall Loop (Anti-Entrenchment Mechanism)  

Enables:
- Mid-term mandate review  
- Recall without character assassination  
- Pattern-based concern escalation  

This loop is designed to be *boring and safe*, so it actually gets used.

---

### 🪢 E. Federation Loop (Cross-Node Coordination)  

Connects:
- Separate commons  
- Regional or thematic clusters  
- Digital and physical sites  

Federation bodies:
- Cannot override local charters  
- Act by synthesis, not decree  
- Dissolve automatically if inactive  

Unity is voluntary and revocable.

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Capture Safeguards  

Every loop embeds:
- Term limits and rotation ceilings  
- Documentation requirements  
- Conflict-of-interest declarations  
- Clear separation between facilitation and decision power  

Charisma, urgency, and crisis are treated as **risk multipliers**, not leadership credentials.

---

## 🧪 Failure Modes This Model Explicitly Disrupts  

- Founder permanence  
- “Temporary” emergency powers that never end  
- Governance theatre masking real control  
- Consensus weaponised to stall dissent  
- Federation drifting into centralisation  

If a loop cannot be exited safely, it is already coercive.

---

## 🧭 How These Loops Are Used  

Federated Governance Loops can:
- Be paired directly with a Commons Charter  
- Overlay existing cooperative structures  
- Scale decision-making without scaling domination  
- Provide audit trails during dispute or breakdown  

They are intentionally repetitive.  
Stability comes from rhythm, not brilliance.

*🏛️ Federated Governance Loops* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides repeatable governance patterns that preserve autonomy, accountability, and adaptability in distributed commons.
