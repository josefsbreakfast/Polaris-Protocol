# 🧠 Residual Attentional Conditioning Injury
**First created:** 2026-01-06 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Proposed mechanistic construct for persistent attentional capture + downstream circadian and neurometabolic disruption following prolonged unpredictable salience exposure.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
**Residual Attentional Conditioning Injury (RACI)** is a proposed *mechanism-first* construct describing how prolonged exposure to **unpredictable, salient stimuli** (including non-symbolic sensory “noise”) can produce **persistent attentional capture**, **hyperarousal**, and **physiological dysregulation** that *continues after the exposure ends*.

This node is written to:
- separate **mechanism** from **intent** (effects-first physiology),
- remain compatible with existing diagnostic frameworks without forcing equivalence,
- make room for **supporting and critical** research threads (including limitations and confounds).

## 🧾 Working definition (proposed)
**Residual Attentional Conditioning Injury (RACI):**  
A systems-induced injury state in which repeated unpredictable salience (digital, environmental, interpersonal, or sensory) produces persistent, involuntary **attentional orienting responses** and **hyperarousal**, with secondary disruption of sleep/circadian regulation and potential **direct neurometabolic effects**, despite intact insight and without requiring psychosis or fixed false beliefs.

## 🧪 Background science (established)
### 1) Noise/stimulus exposure as a physiological stressor
Environmental noise is recognised as a public health risk factor associated with **sleep disturbance** and downstream cardiovascular/metabolic effects; the WHO noise guidelines specifically treat sleep disturbance and non-auditory health outcomes as major endpoints.  [oai_citation:0‡World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2018-3009-42767-59666?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
A major proposed pathway is **stress activation** (sympathetic + HPA axis), with evidence linking noise exposure to cortisol alterations and broader health impacts.  [oai_citation:1‡LWW Journals](https://journals.lww.com/nohe/fulltext/2000/02070/possible_health_effects_of_noise_induced_cortisol.7.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 2) Micro-arousals and autonomic activation during sleep
Sleep fragmentation can occur via **micro-arousals** (often not fully recalled) that still produce autonomic shifts (e.g., sympathetic activation / parasympathetic withdrawal).  [oai_citation:2‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10038786/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
Noise-related sleep disturbance has a substantial disease burden; systematic reviews/meta-analyses continue to update the evidence base.  [oai_citation:3‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9272916/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3) Locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC–NE) system and threat/arousal
The LC–NE system is deeply implicated in threat responses and arousal state regulation, with reviews synthesising its role in acute/chronic threat responding and pathological anxiety.  [oai_citation:4‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479871/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
Experimental work distinguishes effects of tonic vs burst-like LC firing patterns on brain processing biases.  [oai_citation:5‡Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01755-8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 4) Allostatic load framing
Chronic stress physiology can be framed as **allostatic load**: repeated stress activation with insufficient recovery, contributing to downstream metabolic and inflammatory effects.  [oai_citation:6‡spiral.imperial.ac.uk](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/997c6cb9-efc5-4722-877a-c770a010ed5d/content?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 🧬 Hypothesised pathophysiology (RACI model)
### A) Input: unpredictable salience
Examples:
- clustered/variable notifications, intermittent prompts, “timed” cues
- irregular sensory noise (auditory hum, intermittent vibration, low-frequency environmental noise)
- rotating stimulus modalities (“technique rotation”): alternating cue-types prevents habituation/extinction

**Key feature:** unpredictability + low controllability → persistent orienting.

### B) Core neurobiology: attentional capture as conditioned orienting
**Hypothesis:** repeated unpredictable salience produces *conditioned orienting responses* supported by:
- ↑ tonic LC–NE tone (sustained arousal; reduced extinction)
- amygdala–hypothalamic coupling increasing threat readiness
- impaired safety-learning due to absence of “closure” cues

LC–NE mechanisms are biologically plausible substrates for persistent arousal/attention bias.  [oai_citation:7‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479871/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### C) HPA axis and autonomic loop: hyperarousal becomes self-maintaining
**Hypothesis:** sustained LC–NE activation increases sympathetic drive and recruits HPA axis:
- CRH → ACTH → cortisol
- flattening of diurnal cortisol slope and/or elevated evening cortisol (pattern reported in chronic noise exposure studies)  [oai_citation:8‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7888391/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- sympathetic surges during micro-arousals maintain arousal set-point  [oai_citation:9‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10038786/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### D) Circadian disruption as secondary injury
Mechanisms:
- hyperarousal insomnia phenotype (delayed sleep onset, fragmented sleep)
- micro-arousals leading to autonomic instability during sleep  [oai_citation:10‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10038786/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- desynchronisation between central circadian pacemaker and peripheral clocks (hypothesised via repeated sleep fragmentation + cortisol rhythm disruption)

### E) Direct neurometabolic effects (parallel pathway)
Noise/stress exposure may contribute to neurometabolic impacts via:
- repeated cortisol/catecholamine elevation (glucose regulation effects; adipose signalling; inflammatory pathways)
- sleep disturbance-related metabolic dysregulation (independent of conscious attention)

This aligns with the WHO biological mechanisms framing for cardiovascular/metabolic effects of noise.  [oai_citation:11‡World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2018-3009-42767-59666?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### F) Why “rotation of techniques” matters (systems-level)
**Hypothesis:** technique rotation prevents habituation/extinction:
- variable schedules increase conditioning persistence
- prevents “predictable safe windows”
- keeps orienting responses broad and generalised

This is a learning-theory-consistent failure mode: *the system trains on stimulus salience itself* rather than extinguishing it.

## 🗂️ Comparisons to established ICD constructs (mapping, not equivalence)
**Important:** RACI is proposed as a **mechanistic overlay**, not a replacement diagnosis.

### 1) ICD-11 Sleep-wake disorders: chronic insomnia (7A00)
RACI can present with symptom patterns compatible with **chronic insomnia** criteria (sleep initiation/maintenance difficulty despite opportunity + daytime impairment, ≥3 months).  [oai_citation:12‡FindACode](https://www.findacode.com/icd-11/code-323148092.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
**Difference:** RACI foregrounds *conditioning + salience* as a driver; insomnia criteria are descriptive.

### 2) ICD-11 Disorders specifically associated with stress
**Adjustment disorder (6B43):** characterised by preoccupation with a stressor and failure to adapt.  [oai_citation:13‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9881111/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
RACI overlap: repetitive scanning/interrogation of stimuli could look like “preoccupation,” but RACI claims the driver is conditioned orienting and arousal physiology rather than cognitive rumination alone.

**PTSD / CPTSD:** ICD-11 PTSD clusters include re-experiencing, avoidance, and a heightened sense of threat; CPTSD adds disturbances in self-organisation. (Summary sources exist; use ICD-11-aligned descriptions cautiously in clinical contexts.)  [oai_citation:14‡PTSD VA](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/articles/article-pdf/id52075.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
RACI overlap: heightened threat/arousal and sleep disruption.  
RACI distinction: does **not require** trauma memory re-experiencing or the full PTSD/CPTSD cluster set; can be driven by ongoing/previous salience conditioning.

### 3) Practical stance for clinicians
RACI may be best used as:
- a **formulation** (mechanism narrative), plus
- an ICD-coded diagnosis for service access (e.g., insomnia disorder, adjustment disorder, PTSD/CPTSD where criteria are met).

## 🧷 Research threads in critique / limitations (what could be wrong)
### 1) Construct proliferation / diagnostic inflation
Risk: RACI becomes “a new label for old phenomena” (insomnia, hyperarousal, PTSD-related hypervigilance).  
Mitigation: keep RACI as **mechanism** + **formulation tool**, not necessarily a standalone disorder.

### 2) Causality and confounds
- Noise exposure, trauma history, disability stressors, and administrative uncertainty are highly confounded in real life.
- Many studies are observational; attribution requires careful design and/or within-person longitudinal measures.

### 3) Measurement problem (operationalising RACI)
RACI requires measurable markers beyond self-report:
- attentional capture metrics (e.g., vigilance tasks; attentional bias paradigms)
- autonomic markers (HRV patterns; nocturnal sympathetic surges)
- endocrine rhythm (diurnal cortisol slope; evening cortisol)
- sleep architecture (micro-arousals; fragmentation; REM/NREM disruption)

Without measurement consensus, RACI risks becoming rhetorically powerful but empirically mushy.

### 4) Individual differences
Baseline trauma exposure, neurodivergence, sleep disorders, medication effects, and working memory capacity can moderate susceptibility—potentially making RACI heterogeneous.

### 5) Risk of misinterpretation in adversarial contexts
In institutional or legal settings, “conditioning” language may be misread as implying delusion or misattribution.  
Mitigation: emphasise **subcortical arousal physiology**, micro-arousals, and WHO noise-mechanism models.  [oai_citation:22‡World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2018-3009-42767-59666?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 🧰 Testable predictions (if RACI is real)
1) RACI severity correlates with **unpredictability/variability** of stimuli more than absolute intensity.  
2) Physiological markers show **evening cortisol elevation or flattened diurnal slope** in a subset.  [oai_citation:23‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7888391/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
3) Sleep studies show increased **micro-arousals** and autonomic instability, even when subjective awakenings are not recalled.  [oai_citation:24‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10038786/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
4) Reduction of unpredictable stimuli + provision of closure/extinction cues improves symptoms more than cognitive disputation alone.

---

## 🧭 Open questions
- What is the minimal exposure duration/intensity to induce persistent residual conditioning?
- Which biomarkers best distinguish RACI from PTSD hypervigilance vs primary insomnia?
- Can re-entrainment protocols (sleep timing, light exposure, autonomic stabilisation) accelerate extinction in RACI?
- How does “technique rotation” alter extinction kinetics and generalisation?

## 🧯 Evidence-based risk reduction (RACI harm minimisation)
**Scope:** practical steps that reduce (a) conditioned orienting / hyperarousal, (b) circadian disruption, and (c) downstream neurometabolic load — without requiring attribution of intent.

### 1) Reduce unpredictability at the stimulus layer (highest leverage)
RACI is amplified by *unpredictable, uncontrollable salience*. Primary goal: convert “random hits” into “bounded signals”.
- **Notification triage:** disable non-essential push notifications; batch delivery where possible; whitelist only user-set alarms/reminders.
- **Time-bounding:** create predictable “quiet windows” (e.g., 90–120 min blocks) to permit extinction learning.
- **Stimulus control:** keep phone out of bedroom; use a separate, single-purpose alarm clock if needed.

### 2) Noise exposure mitigation (sleep + autonomic stability)
Environmental noise is treated as a public health stressor with non-auditory effects including sleep disturbance and downstream cardiometabolic pathways.  [oai_citation:0‡World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2018-3009-42767-59666?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Night-time noise reduction:** physical dampening (draft excluders, curtains, door seals), relocation of chargers/transformers away from bed, trial sleeping in a different room if feasible.
- **Document variability:** note timing/patterns of recurrent noise *only insofar as it supports mitigation* (avoid spiralling into exhaustive monitoring).
- **Caution with masking noise:** constant masking can help some people sleep, but if it increases vigilance or annoyance, stop.

### 3) Treat insomnia properly (not just “sleep hygiene”)
CBT-I is first-line for chronic insomnia in adults (including “secondary” insomnia).  [oai_citation:1‡CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/insomnia/management/managing-insomnia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
If RACI is present, insomnia interventions should emphasise:
- **Stimulus control** (bed = sleep; leave bed if wide awake; return when sleepy).
- **Sleep restriction therapy** (tightening time-in-bed to rebuild sleep drive).
- **Relapse planning** (because re-triggering is expected in RACI trajectories).

### 4) Circadian re-entrainment (light + timing)
For circadian rhythm disruption, evidence-based approaches include timed **light exposure** and (selectively) melatonin, per sleep-medicine guidance.  [oai_citation:2‡aasm.org](https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Morning bright light** (consistent timing) + **evening light reduction** to shift/anchor rhythm.
- Keep wake time as stable as possible; move bedtime gradually (15–30 minutes steps).

### 5) Autonomic downshift training (physiology-first)
Because micro-arousals and autonomic shifts can occur without full waking, downshifting sympathetic tone is often helpful.
- daily paced breathing / HRV biofeedback style practice (short, regular doses)
- gentle daytime movement + daylight exposure (supports sleep pressure + circadian anchoring)

### 6) Neurometabolic monitoring (if symptoms persist)
Given the WHO biological-mechanisms framing that links noise/stress pathways to metabolic and cardiovascular effects, consider basic monitoring if clinically appropriate.  [oai_citation:3‡World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2018-3009-42767-59666?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Examples: weight changes, glucose dysregulation symptoms, blood pressure variability, fatigue profile, appetite shifts.
(Clinical assessment decides tests; this node just flags plausibility of downstream load.)

## 🧾 Investigator / clinician ethics reminder (non-extractive handling)
**If any investigation, safeguarding process, or service response is underway:**
- **No new “extractive research” on the subject** (no experimental probing, no additional behavioural manipulation, no “testing responses”).
- **Consent boundary:** use **pre-existing records only** unless the subject gives explicit, informed, revocable consent for new data collection.
- **Minimise collection:** collect the smallest dataset necessary; time-bound retention; document access.
- **Duty of closure:** provide *status updates within reason* (even if details can’t be disclosed), because prolonged uncertainty is itself a harm multiplier in RACI trajectories.
- **Do not pathologise reality-testing:** persistent interrogation of salience can be a conditioned attentional effect, not delusion.

*Operational note:* This section exists because vulnerable populations require **higher** ethical standards, and because RACI can be worsened by continued uncertainty, stimulus rotation, or unannounced technique changes.
