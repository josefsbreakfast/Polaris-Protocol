## Literature Review Funnel: Phase Definitions

This directory organises research activity using a **funnelled review methodology**, moving deliberately from broad contextual mapping to narrower, higher-confidence synthesis.

The funnel exists to ensure that:
- relevant evidence is not prematurely excluded,
- cross-disciplinary signals are captured before narrowing,
- and claims are proportionate to the strength and provenance of available evidence.

Each phase has a distinct purpose. Progression between phases is intentional, not automatic.

---

### Phase 0 — Problem-Space Mapping (Exploratory)

**Purpose:**  
To define the *shape* of the problem space before making evidentiary claims.

This phase captures how surveillance-saturated environments are described, experienced, and theorised across disciplines, including:
- surveillance studies,
- cybernetics and psychocybernetics,
- security and modern warfare literature,
- decolonial and post-colonial analysis,
- cultural and media representations.

Work at this stage is **descriptive and conceptual**, not evaluative.  
The aim is to surface recurring environments, exposures, metaphors, and hypothesised impacts.

**Outputs:**  
- conceptual maps of surveillance environments,  
- hypothesised health-relevant pathways,  
- candidate mechanisms for later testing.

---

### Phase 1 — Mechanism Identification (Scoping)

**Purpose:**  
To identify **plausible mechanisms** that could link surveillance exposure to holistic health outcomes.

This phase draws on established research in:
- chronic stress biology and multisystem health,
- trauma and stress-related psychiatric conditions,
- sleep and circadian disruption,
- perceived surveillance and anticipatory behaviour,
- workplace and institutional monitoring.

The emphasis is on *how* harm could occur, not on proving that it does.

**Outputs:**  
- a stabilised list of candidate mechanisms (e.g. hypervigilance, chronic stress activation),
- preliminary cross-domain support for each mechanism,
- identification of mechanisms that merit deeper review.

---

### Phase 2 — Domain-Focused Reviews (Targeted)

**Purpose:**  
To evaluate the strongest candidate mechanisms within **well-studied analogue settings**.

This phase prioritises domains where:
- surveillance exposure is clearly defined,
- populations are identifiable,
- and health outcomes are measured.

Typical domains include:
- workplace surveillance and electronic performance monitoring,
- policing, carceral, and state surveillance,
- surveillance in schools and healthcare settings.

**Outputs:**  
- domain-specific literature reviews,
- evidence summaries with confidence grading,
- identification of moderators (e.g. consent, legitimacy, transparency).

---

### Phase 3 — Cross-Domain Synthesis (Integrative)

**Purpose:**  
To integrate findings across domains and assess **convergence, divergence, and gaps**.

This phase explicitly distinguishes between:
- evidence of harm,
- evidence of plausibility,
- absence of evidence due to methodological or classification constraints.

Contradictory findings are retained and analysed rather than smoothed over.

**Outputs:**  
- mechanism-led synthesis tables,
- boundary-setting around what can and cannot be claimed,
- identification of priority gaps for future research.

---

### Phase 4 — Responses, Adaptation, and Critique (Contained)

**Purpose:**  
To examine proposed responses to surveillance-related stress without normalising harmful baselines.

This phase includes critical analysis of:
- burnout and resilience frameworks,
- coping and adaptation interventions,
- organisational and institutional “wellbeing” strategies.

Interventions are assessed for whether they:
- reduce exposure,
- redistribute power,
- or shift responsibility onto individuals.

**Outputs:**  
- critical evaluation of adaptation narratives,
- distinction between protective and responsibilising approaches,
- implications for policy and practice.

---

## Movement Through the Funnel

Progression from one phase to the next is driven by:
- repeated identification of shared mechanisms,
- convergence across independent domains,
- relevance to policy, clinical, or oversight contexts.

Material does not advance through the funnel by default.  
Narrowing is an analytical decision, not an inevitability.
