# 🌶️ WHOQOL-BREF Surveillance Impact Scoring
**First created:** 2026-01-06 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Theorising harm reduction and efficiency increase in community-level CVE provision.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node proposes **WHOQOL-BREF** as a **mandatory impact and value-for-money scoring instrument** for any non-emergency surveillance or behavioural intervention applied to civilians.

The objective is not attribution, disclosure, or intelligence evaluation.

The objective is **human impact accounting**:
- Is quality of life improved, unchanged, or degraded?
- Is vulnerability reduced or amplified?
- Is public money being spent where it delivers the greatest protective return?

If an intervention cannot tolerate transparent quality-of-life measurement, it is **not safe for population-scale deployment**.

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

> **If quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are valid bases for allocating healthcare funding, then quality-of-life metrics are a valid basis for allocating security funding that affects civilians.**

There is no defensible exception.

---

## 🧠 Why WHOQOL-BREF (and not symptom-only tools)

WHOQOL-BREF was selected deliberately because it measures **expansive human impact**, not just clinical symptoms.

It captures domains that surveillance and securitised governance routinely damage but rarely count:

- dignity and self-presentation
- intimacy and relationships
- environmental safety
- autonomy and predictability
- social participation and belonging

These domains are **not optional extras**. They are protective factors against long-term harm and vulnerability.

---

## 📊 WHOQOL-BREF Domains → Surveillance-Relevant Impact

### 1) Physical Health
- sleep quality and circadian regulation  
- fatigue and energy for daily life  
- stress-related somatic effects  

### 2) Psychological Health
- attentional capture and cognitive load  
- emotional regulation  
- sense of agency and control  
- stress, anxiety, hopelessness  

### 3) Social Relationships
- intimacy with partner  
- closeness with friends and family  
- parenting capacity  
- withdrawal or isolation  

### 4) Environment
- perceived safety  
- home as a place of rest  
- access to transport, education, services  
- ability to exist publicly without shame  

**Key point:** WHOQOL-BREF measures *impact*, not intent.

---

## 🧬 Developmental Safeguard (Children & Young Adults)

For under-25s:
- the prefrontal cortex is still developing
- stress regulation systems are highly plastic
- adverse exposures have **longer lifetime effects**

Any intervention that:
- increases stress,
- induces shame,
- suppresses identity exploration,
- or degrades protective relationships

is likely to **increase long-term vulnerability**, not reduce it.

Normal adolescent boundary-testing, ideological exploration, emotional intensity, and identity formation **must not be misclassified as security risk**.

---

## 🔁 Internal Model Failure (PREVENT/CHANNEL Logic)

Within counter-extremism frameworks, vulnerability markers include:
- stress
- isolation
- hopelessness
- identity disruption
- loss of belonging

If an intervention:
- worsens WHOQOL-BREF scores, then
- vulnerability scores increase, and
- by the model’s own logic, **risk increases**

This creates a **positive feedback loop**:
intervention → harm → higher vulnerability → more intervention.

That is **risk amplification**, not prevention.

---

## 🧑‍⚕️ MDT Contrast: Healthcare vs Surveillance Governance

### Healthcare MDTs
- always include a clinician who knows the patient
- longitudinal contact
- named accountability
- duty of candour
- clear stop/modify criteria

### Surveillance / PREVENT Boards
- often no treating clinician present
- abstract risk assessment
- diffuse accountability
- weak feedback loops
- harm surfaces later in healthcare

**If an intervention affects health, family life, and development, it must meet healthcare-grade governance standards or be treated as structurally unsafe.**

---

## 💊 Iatrogenic Clinicalisation Risk

When upstream stressors cannot be removed:
- CBT has limited effect
- distress tolerance replaces recovery
- medication becomes the default containment tool

This shifts cost and harm into the NHS:
- antidepressant prescribing
- CAMHS referrals
- crisis services
- long-term morbidity

WHOQOL-BREF detects this **before** harm is medicalised.

---

## 💷 Value-for-Money & Opportunity Cost

WHOQOL-BREF doubles as a **spending compass**.

Repeatedly, vulnerability maps onto:
- environment
- transport
- education quality
- access to sport, recreation, and third spaces
- community cohesion

Yet funding disproportionately flows to:
- surveillance contractors
- analytics vendors
- research institutions
- metadata monitoring

For less money, **infrastructure and youth provision** deliver larger, durable QoL gains and stronger protection against exploitation and violence.

Failure to compare these pathways is **inefficient governance**.

---

## 📈 QOF-Style KPI Logic (Service-Level)

WHOQOL-BREF should be applied **at service level**, not as an individual compliance tool.

Minimum KPIs:
- aggregate domain deltas (baseline → follow-up)
- stratified by age band, locality, referral source
- non-worsening thresholds
- automatic review / pause triggers on decline

If GP practices are incentivised via QOF to improve QoL-linked outcomes, a national security programme affecting children can meet the same standard.

---

## 🔐 Measurement Without Coercion: Secret Ballot Requirement

Outcome measurement **must not become another pressure channel**.

### Mandatory safeguards
- separation of intervention and measurement teams
- no case-level linkage
- no device identifiers
- no metadata exploitation
- delayed reporting windows
- minimum aggregation thresholds

### Preferred models
1) **Independent area-level sampling** (best)
2) **Third-party confidential collection**
3) **Offline paper ballot with sealed aggregation**

If these conditions cannot be met:
> **WHOQOL-BREF must not be collected at individual level.**

---

## 🚫 Explicit Prohibitions

- QoL scores must **never** be used to:
  - extend cases
  - escalate monitoring
  - justify further intervention
- No new extractive research without explicit consent
- No covert stimulus rotation during measurement periods

Measurement exists to **protect people**, not systems.

---

## 🧭 Governance Rule

> **In 2026, the absence of anonymised, aggregate quality-of-life dashboards for a population-scale civilian intervention is not a technical limitation. It is a governance choice.**

---

## 🏁 Stop Rule

If a programme cannot demonstrate:
- stable or improving WHOQOL-BREF scores, and
- superior cost-effectiveness compared to upstream alternatives,

then under standard public-finance logic:
- funding should be paused, reduced, or redirected.

## 🏮 Footer

*🌶️ WHOQOL-BREF Surveillance Impact Scoring* is a Polaris Protocol governance node.

It asserts that **human impact must be measurable, coercion-resistant, and decisive** in the allocation of public funds for non-emergency security interventions—especially those affecting children and young adults.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Measurement is not neutral.*
