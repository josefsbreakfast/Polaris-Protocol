# 🦅 Overstimulated Prey Response
**First created:** 2026-01-09 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*A threshold-exacerbation model for neuropsychological overload under persistent surveillance conditions.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
This node proposes a **limited, exploratory framework** for understanding a subset of neuropsychological presentations emerging in highly surveilled or continuously monitored environments.

It does **not** offer a monocausal explanation for late neurodivergent or mental health diagnosis.

Late diagnosis is widely and legitimately explained by multiple factors, including:
- improved disability justice and advocacy,
- increased clinical awareness and training,
- broader diagnostic criteria and screening,
- reduced stigma and improved self-recognition.

These developments represent **genuine progress** and account for a substantial proportion of observed diagnostic increases.

This node instead addresses a **specific subset of cases** where persistent environmental pressure — particularly ambient surveillance, evaluation, or risk monitoring — may **exacerbate pre-existing, subclinical traits**, pushing individuals across a functional or clinical threshold.

In this framing, surveillance does not *create* neurodivergence or mental illness.  
It may, however, **overwhelm compensatory mechanisms** that previously allowed individuals to function without clinical impairment.

---

## ✨ Key Features of the Proposed Response Pattern
Observed features in this subset may include:
- sustained hypervigilance without discrete threat events,
- heightened sensory sensitivity and reduced filtering capacity,
- oscillation between over-performance and shutdown,
- executive dysfunction under observation or evaluation,
- delayed collapse following periods of perceived safety,
- somatic stress symptoms without clear organic cause.

These features resemble a **prey-state adaptation** to continuous, ambiguous threat rather than a discrete trauma response.

---

## 🧿 Threshold Exacerbation (Not Environmental Injury)
A central distinction of this model is **threshold crossing**, not causation.

- Individuals may carry latent, subclinical, or well-compensated traits.
- Persistent environmental load increases cognitive, sensory, and autonomic demand.
- Once regulatory capacity is exceeded, traits become **functionally impairing**.
- Clinical recognition follows — not because the condition is new, but because compensation has failed.

This aligns with established models of:
- chronic hypervigilance,
- sensory gating overload,
- allostatic load exceeding adaptive capacity.

---

## 🫁 Surveillance as an Ambient Stressor
Unlike acute threats, surveillant environments are characterised by:
- continuous observation without clear endpoints,
- opaque or automated evaluative processes,
- absence of clear escape or resolution cues.

From a nervous-system perspective, this produces **persistent readiness without discharge**, mirroring conditions under which prey animals exhibit exhaustion, collapse, or maladaptive behaviour once threat pressure becomes constant.

---

## 🧠 Interaction With Existing ND & MH Profiles
This response is likely **non-uniformly distributed**.

Individuals with:
- neurodivergent sensory profiles,
- trauma histories,
- chronic illness,
- or membership in heavily monitored populations

may experience **disproportionate impact**, not due to fragility but due to **baseline load differences**.

This may explain:
- apparent “loss of coping” in adulthood,
- regression under monitoring or assessment regimes,
- sudden functional decline following policy or surveillance changes.

---

## 🔍 A Cautious Public Health Signal — For Exploration, Not Assumption
At present, there is **insufficient research** to confirm or dismiss surveillance-linked threshold effects at population scale.

One proposed research signal would be **geographical divergence**:
- unexplained regional increases in late diagnosis,
- persisting after controlling for service access, demographics, and awareness campaigns,
- overlapping spatially or temporally with intensified surveillance, prevent, or predictive governance measures.

Such patterns would **not constitute proof of harm**, but would justify **public health investigation** — as much to *rule out* unintended effects as to confirm them.

The goal is not alarm, but **due diligence**.  

---

## 🏛️ Why This Matters for Policy, Not Just Health

This framework is advanced not only as a harm-reduction measure, but as a **good-faith invitation to governance actors** who have expressed concern about rising diagnosis rates, perceived over-medicalisation, or the social coherence of current public health trends.

In particular, this includes policymakers who:
- question diagnostic growth in neurodivergence or mental health,
- advocate for expanded border controls, predictive policing, or risk-scoring regimes,
- and simultaneously maintain financial, political, or material relationships with surveillance, AI, data-analytics, or affiliated technology industries.

Where such actors express confusion or scepticism about rising health concerns, it would be both rational and responsible to **collaboratively examine whether governance choices themselves warrant exclusion as contributing factors**.

If surveillance-dense environments are *not* exerting measurable threshold effects, rigorous multidisciplinary research would help demonstrate that clearly.

If, however, even limited interaction effects are identified, early recognition would allow:
- targeted mitigation,
- policy refinement,
- and avoidance of unintended population-level harm.

Either outcome serves public interest.

This node therefore positions investigation not as accusation, but as **due diligence** — particularly for those seeking to reconcile expanded surveillance practices with parallel concern about clinical prevalence, social cost, and public trust.

Refusing such inquiry while continuing to question diagnosis rates risks displacing responsibility onto individuals, clinicians, or disabled communities, rather than examining the full systemic context in which these outcomes arise.

## 🧪 Why This Has Not Been Adequately Studied
A key limitation to date is disciplinary separation.

Security sciences:
- model risk, compliance, and prediction,
- but rarely include neurobiology, sensory processing, or clinical thresholds.

Healthcare disciplines:
- treat stress and overload clinically,
- but often lack visibility into surveillance architectures or governance regimes.

As a result, a potential interaction space remains under-examined.

This node explicitly calls for **multidisciplinary collaboration** between:
- public health,
- neuropsychology,
- disability studies,
- and security or governance researchers.

*🦅 Overstimulated Prey Response* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It contributes a cautious, testable framework for exploring how surveillant environments may interact with neuropsychological thresholds, without undermining disability justice or over-asserting causation.
