# 🦉 Language As Attack Surface

*How words are engineered, degraded, and weaponised in modern information environments.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This folder treats **language as infrastructure**.

Not metaphorically.  
Operationally.

In contemporary digital systems, language is:
- how legitimacy is granted or withdrawn,
- how harm is minimised or escalated,
- how publics are oriented toward action or paralysis.

Once language becomes programmable — via platforms, policy, moderation, PR, and repetition — it also becomes an **attack surface**.

This folder documents how that happens.

---

## 🧠 What “Attack Surface” Means Here  

An attack surface is any point where a system can be influenced, degraded, or hijacked.

Applied to language, this includes:
- euphemism creep,
- frame drift,
- semantic laundering,
- moral inversion,
- procedural neutrality masking harm,
- and the strategic exhaustion of meaning.

These are not accidents.
They are **repeatable patterns**.

## 🦆 Why This Lives in Digital Disruption  

This is not linguistics for its own sake.

The concern here is **effect**:
- policy outcomes,
- media response,
- public tolerance for harm,
- survivor credibility,
- institutional escape velocity.

Digital platforms accelerate linguistic mutation.
Governance lags.
Harm arrives first.

This folder exists to shorten that lag.

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here  

Nodes in this directory typically include:

- **Frame drift watchlists**  
  Tracking how terms shift meaning over time.

- **Euphemism analysis**  
  Why certain phrases appear precisely when accountability is threatened.

- **Language-as-infrastructure**  
  How words function like rails, not decoration.

- **Counterframes**  
  Not slogans — corrective lenses.

- **Archive capture tools**  
  Because screenshots matter once language mutates.

- **Why “neutral” language is never neutral**  
  Especially during active harm.

These files are meant to be *used*, not admired.

## 🛠️ How To Use This Folder  

This is a **live reference environment**.

Use it to:
- sanity-check language you’re encountering,
- identify when a narrative has been quietly rewritten,
- resist being walked into false binaries,
- preserve original meanings before they’re scrubbed.

It pairs naturally with:
- watchdog work,
- journalism,
- safeguarding,
- survivor advocacy,
- policy analysis.

---

## 🧭 What This Is Not  

This is **not**:
- culture-war punditry,
- vibes-based discourse critique,
- a glossary of “bad words.”

It is pattern recognition under pressure.

If language is being contested, something material is at stake.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Language As Attack Surface* is a working sub-archive of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It exists to document how meaning is shaped, softened, or sabotaged in order to produce compliant outcomes.

Language does not just describe reality.  
It decides which realities are survivable.
