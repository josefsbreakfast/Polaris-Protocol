# 🧿 Parsh–Fasr  
**First created:** 2025-12-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-28    
*An analytic register for interpretive unpacking — explanation without instrumental persuasion.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This folder holds **Parsh–Fasr** as a working term and method: a paired Hebrew–Arabic analytic register (root-label) used to describe **narrative decoding and historical clarification** without sliding into advocacy, justification, or “explanation as coercion”.

**Why it lives here:** language is an attack surface. When “explanation” is weaponised into narrative control, the counter-move is not counter-propaganda — it’s **method**: interpret, disentangle, expose structure, and keep the record intact even when it’s uncomfortable.

**Core distinction:**  
- **Hasbara** → explanation with intent to persuade / justify power.  
- **Parsh–Fasr** → interpretive unpacking constrained by fidelity to the record.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Bilingual signal without flattening:** paired gesture, not forced harmony.  
- **Method over message:** prioritises process, provenance, and structure.  
- **Ambiguity-tolerant:** does not demand narrative closure or moral comfort.  
- **Power-aware:** keeps asymmetry visible; refuses “balance” as erasure.  
- **Diaspora-compatible:** designed for contexts where identity is routinely collapsed into state justification.

## 🧿 What “Parsh–Fasr” Means Here  
**Parsh–Fasr** is used as a *root-label* (technical shorthand). In explanatory prose we use the fully grammatical abstract nouns:

- Hebrew: **פרשנות (parshanut)** — interpretation / interpretive practice  
- Arabic: **تفسير (tafsīr)** — interpretation / exegesis

Working gloss: **Interpretive Unpacking**.

## 🦉 What This Folder Contains  
Suggested contents (create as needed):

- `glossary.md` — definitions, usage notes, “what this is / isn’t”  
- `patterns.md` — recurring narrative moves (selective context, moral laundering, “complexity” as fog)  
- `counter_moves.md` — Parsh–Fasr techniques: sourcing, timeline repair, frame detection, claim disaggregation  
- `examples/` — annotated threads, speeches, articles (light quotes, heavy structure)  
- `reading_list.md` — historical record, historiography, discourse analysis, media literacy  
- `scripts/` — short, deployable responses that keep truth-constraints intact (no debate bait)

---

## 🧭 Usage Rules  
- **No “persuasion by vibe.”** If you can’t source it, don’t launder it via tone.  
- **No forced symmetry.** Co-presence ≠ equal power; do not erase the present by performing neutrality.  
- **No identity collapse.** “Jewish” is not shorthand for a state; don’t reproduce the trap you’re trying to escape.  
- **No rhetorical hostage-taking.** The goal is literacy and record-keeping, not winning.

*🧿 Parsh–Fasr* is a living folder of the Polaris Protocol.  
It contributes a **truth-constrained analytic register** for decoding narratives where “explanation” is routinely weaponised into justification.
