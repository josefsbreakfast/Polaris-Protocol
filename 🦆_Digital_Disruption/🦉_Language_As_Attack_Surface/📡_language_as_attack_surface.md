# 📡 Language as Attack Surface  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-25  
*How linguistic drift becomes an exploitable vector for coordinated manipulation and how to defend against it.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

Language is infrastructure. When actors manipulate vocabulary, euphemism, or frame velocity, they exploit a blind spot between cybersecurity and communications. This node defines that surface, maps the attack mechanics, and provides templates for documenting and counter-acting frame drift across open networks.

## 🧩 Key Claims  

- Every modern information-operation includes **semantic engineering** — coordinated shifts in meaning, metaphor, or emotional register.  
- Algorithmic amplification turns linguistic novelty into an accelerant.  
- Counter-measures depend on **archival precision** + **memetic clarity**.  
- Survivor-voice fidelity is the baseline integrity model: tone is signal.

## 🛠️ Operational Countermeasures  

1. **Archive-first:** capture screenshots + plaintext + UTC timestamp + URL + hash.  
2. **Living Glossary:** track euphemism → literal term in `what_they_now_call_X.csv`.  
3. **Watchlist Rules:** see `watchlist/frame_drift_watchlist.yaml`.  
4. **Counter-frames:** short (≤ 7 words) truthful reframings; test for shareability.  
5. **Cross-mirroring:** store ≥ 2 independent copies + hash manifest.  
6. **Community inoculation:** teach frame-recognition + archival reflex.  
7. **Legal flagging:** escalate when phrasing → incitement; attach archive bundle.

## 📚 Historical Examples  

- **Osip Mandelstam (USSR)** — imprisoned 1934 after reciting a poem mocking Stalin; metaphor treated as sedition.  
- **Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o (Kenya)** — detained 1977 for plays in Gikuyu; linguistic autonomy criminalised.  
- **Forugh Farrokhzad (Iran)** — poems banned post-1979; female voice coded as threat.  
- **Rwandan Radio (1994)** — euphemism “cut the tall trees” functioned as kill order.  
- **Akhmatova & Oral Preservation (USSR)** — poems memorised to evade state erasure.  

Each shows how controlling language becomes equivalent to controlling territory.
