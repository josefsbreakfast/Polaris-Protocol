# 🎭 Poets as Primary Targets

*Why expressive workers become first-wave targets in systems that weaponise language.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Authoritarian and extractive systems prioritise control of meaning before control of territory.  
Writers, poets, song-makers, and comedians sit at the nerve ending of collective imagination.  
When they name a truth the system needs hidden, their metaphors become evidence — and their visibility becomes a liability.  
This node traces historical patterns of targeting, and outlines protective counter-infrastructure.

## 📚 Historical Precedent  

| Era / Region | Figure | Mechanism of Suppression | Lesson |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------|---------|
| USSR (1930s) | **Osip Mandelstam** | Arrested for poem mocking Stalin | Metaphor can indict power more efficiently than pamphlets. |
| Iran (1960s–70s) | **Forugh Farrokhzad** | Censorship + posthumous erasure | Female autonomy framed as cultural contamination. |
| Kenya (1977) | **Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o** | Imprisoned for play in Gikuyu | Linguistic self-determination treated as sedition. |
| Chile (1973–1976) | **Pablo Neruda** | Surveillance → poisoning | Poetry as international moral diplomacy. |
| Contemporary | **Journalists, musicians, cartoonists** | “Security” or “morality” charges | Digital platforms replicate historic repression logic. |

## 🧩 Structural Pattern  

1. **Symbolic capture** — Art is re-categorised as propaganda or obscenity.  
2. **Isolation** — Target’s community cut off via reputation or access control.  
3. **Semantic reversal** — Truthful speech renamed “misinformation.”  
4. **Legal reframing** — Cultural work criminalised under safety / integrity / cyber clauses.  
5. **Erasure phase** — Works de-indexed, biographies rewritten, tone neutralised.

## 🧱 Protective Infrastructure  

- **Distributed Archiving:** Mirror vulnerable works under multiple civic or academic custodians.  
- **Tone Preservation:** Store oral and performance versions alongside transcripts.  
- **Visibility as Shield:** When risk rises, increase public circulation; disappearance invites disappearance.  
- **Metadata Integrity:** Keep hashes and timestamps; provenance defends authenticity.  
- **Coalition Amplification:** Link writers, technologists, and lawyers in rapid-response chains.  
- **Cultural Sanctuary Protocols:** Pre-established safe-harbour routes for threatened artists.
