# 💔 Personhood Denial via Naming Control  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*How controlling names, pronouns, and identifiers functions as a low-cost method of stripping recognition, dignity, and civic standing.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines **personhood denial through naming control** — the use of names, labels, pronouns, or refusals thereof to undermine someone’s recognised humanity without overt violence.

Naming is not cosmetic. It is a **recognition technology**.

Who is named correctly is legible as a person.
Who is misnamed, erased, or deliberately distorted is made administratively fragile.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Frames naming as a governance tool, not personal preference
* Distinguishes accidental error from strategic denial
* Connects misnaming to legal, social, and safety harms
* Explains why naming battles escalate during conflict
* Grounds pronoun respect in democratic infrastructure

---

## 💔 What Naming Control Looks Like

Personhood denial via naming appears as:

* persistent deadnaming after correction
* refusal to use affirmed pronouns
* reduction of individuals to categories (“the migrant”, “the protester”)
* stripping names from victims while naming perpetrators obliquely
* bureaucratic insistence on outdated identifiers

The common feature is **asymmetry**.

---

## 🧠 Why Naming Is Power

Naming matters because it:

* establishes subjecthood
* enables legal recognition
* signals social belonging
* anchors responsibility and harm

To deny correct naming is to deny **standing**.

---

## ⚠️ Accidental vs Strategic Misnaming

This node draws a hard distinction:

* **Accidental misnaming** — transitional, correctable, non-punitive
* **Strategic misnaming** — persistent, public, coercive

The harm lies not in error, but in **refusal to repair**.

---

## ⚖️ Governance Consequences

When naming control is used strategically:

* individuals lose procedural credibility
* complaints are dismissed as incoherent
* violence becomes easier to justify
* exclusion is normalised without force
* speech protections are hollowed out

Personhood erodes administratively before it erodes physically.

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Signals

Personhood denial via naming is occurring when:

* correction is treated as aggression
* policy language overrides lived identity
* naming disputes replace substantive issues
* dehumanising labels proliferate
* respect is framed as ideological compliance

These signal governance failure, not free speech.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Naming** = recognition infrastructure
* **Denial** = administrative harm
* **Repair** = democratic maintenance

You cannot claim to respect rights while denying names.
