# ⚗ Intentionality as the Moral Threshold  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-19  
*How debates over intent are used to delay accountability, downgrade harm, and shift moral burden away from power.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines **intentionality** as a repeatedly weaponised threshold in moral, legal, and media discourse.

Across governance systems, harm is often treated as morally actionable **only once intent is proven** — even when outcomes are predictable, repeated, and structurally produced.

This elevates intent from a factor to a **gatekeeping requirement**, allowing preventable harm to persist while responsibility is deferred.

## ✨ Key Features

* Distinguishes intent from foreseeability and pattern
* Shows how intent standards advantage powerful actors
* Explains why harm is downgraded without explicit intent
* Connects intent fixation to moral and legal delay
* Provides diagnostics for recognising intent‑based deflection

## ⚗ What “Intentionality” Is Doing

In practice, intent discourse:

* shifts focus from outcomes to motives
* reframes systemic harm as accident or error
* raises proof thresholds beyond reach of victims
* allows repetition without escalation

The question quietly changes from:

> *What happened and could it have been prevented?*

to:

> *Can you prove they meant it?*

## 🧠 Why Intent Thresholds Protect Power

Intent thresholds favour those who:

* control documentation
* act through layers of delegation
* benefit from plausible deniability
* operate via systems rather than direct acts

Harm that is distributed becomes morally weightless.

## ⚖️ Governance Consequences

When intentionality is treated as the moral threshold:

* foreseeable harm is normalised
* prevention obligations evaporate
* repeated damage is reframed as misfortune
* accountability stalls indefinitely
* victims are tasked with mind‑reading

Outcome becomes secondary to motive.

---

## 🚨 Diagnostic Signals

Intentionality deflection is present when:

* discussions fixate on “proof of intent” despite clear patterns
* harm is acknowledged but responsibility denied
* apologies substitute for corrective action
* prevention is framed as impossible
* critics are accused of imputing bad faith

These indicate moral threshold manipulation.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Intent** = one factor, not the gate
* **Foreseeability** = moral trigger
* **Pattern** = responsibility amplifier

If harm is predictable and repeated, intent is no longer the question.

*⚗ Intentionality as the Moral Threshold* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how fixation on intent delays accountability and allows foreseeable, repeated harm to persist without consequence.
