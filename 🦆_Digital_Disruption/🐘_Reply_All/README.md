## 🛰️ Orientation  

**Reply All** is a Digital Disruption subfolder focused on **public, collective actions** that increase transparency, strengthen visibility, and support democratic accountability in digital and media environments.

It includes projects where individuals or communities use broadcasting, open intelligence practices, or collective communication to:

- resist or mitigate suppression,  
- increase the circulation of public-interest information,  
- support independent journalism,  
- strengthen civic oversight, and  
- re-establish visibility after disruption.

This folder is concerned with practices that operate **outside formal institutions**, focusing on community-driven or independent initiatives that improve information access and democratic resilience.

## ✨ What Belongs Here  

Nodes in **Reply_All** typically cover:

- independent or alternative publications recovering visibility,  
- community-led counter-surveillance and accountability projects,  
- grassroots public-interest investigations,  
- decentralised audit and oversight practices,  
- collective communication strategies designed to increase transparency,  
- broadcast-based approaches to reasserting visibility,  
- satirical or investigative media projects acting as democratic watchdogs,  
- hybrid civic OSINT or counter-intelligence efforts,  
- communication practices used to overcome disruption or suppression.

Any node describing **community-based or collective action** that supports visibility, transparency, or accountability fits here.
