# 🧿 Private Eye Bounces Back  
**First created:** 2025-11-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-14  
*When Britain’s oldest satirical paper rediscovers its bite, it signals that the absurd has overtaken the official.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Between 2024 and 2025, *Private Eye* shifted from cautious mockery to full‑scale investigative audacity.  
The magazine’s renewed humour coincides with political absurdity peaking: censorship tightening, PR machines overreaching, and journalists rediscovering irony as a public‑interest weapon.

## 🧩 Timeline of the Tone Reboot  
- **1620–1625 (early 2024)** — Standard constitutional ribbing; monarchy safe zone.  
- **1630–1650 (late 2024 → spring 2025)** — Covers target tech‑authoritarian and hard‑right figures (Musk, Farage, Putin); tone shifts from *banter* → *indictment*.  
- **1658–1660 (autumn 2025)** — Humour explodes: Gaza puns, open swearing, full exposure of AI‑ethics PR, and a clear decision that politeness no longer serves democracy.

## 🔍 Analysis  
Satire functions as a pressure gauge. When the press grows funny again, it’s because repression has reached critical mass.  
By ridiculing AI‑ethics PR and “responsible warfare” narratives, *Private Eye* re‑asserts the right to **forensic laughter**—a way of documenting state absurdity while surviving it.  

The return of bite isn’t nostalgia; it’s adaptive resistance. In humour lies a metadata signature that cannot be deepfaked: timing, irony, shared recognition.
