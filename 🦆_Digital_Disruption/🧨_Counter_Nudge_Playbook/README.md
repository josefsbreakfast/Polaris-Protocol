*Behavioural counter-operations for narrative integrity.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Propaganda and behavioural design aim to collapse discernment into reaction.  
The *Counter Nudge Playbook* reverses that — showing how to map, interrupt, and re-route manipulative scripts.  

It is not about propaganda versus propaganda.  
It’s about reclaiming the human nervous system from engineered persuasion.

---

## 🧩 Methodology  
1. **Decode Scripts** — identify the nudge type: fear, shame, apathy, hero bait.  
2. **Map Loops** — note recurrence patterns: who benefits from repetition?  
3. **Insert Friction** — use humour, refusal, or fact patterning to break flow.  
4. **Redirect Attention** — restore focus to civic agency, not outrage markets.  
5. **Archive Artifacts** — every campaign leaves metadata fingerprints; trace, don’t chase.  

Disruption doesn’t mean chaos.  
It means *refusing to be automated*.
