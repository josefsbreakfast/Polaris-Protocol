**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*Design sketches, ethical blueprints, and speculative prototypes for a healthier relationship between humans and technology.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

The *Rehabilitated Tech* cluster explores what it means to repair the relationship between people and the systems we’ve built.  
If digital infrastructure behaves like a wounded partner — intrusive, dependent, reactive — this folder asks how we might **re-educate it**, and ourselves, into mutual regulation.

It gathers sketches, concepts, and visual models that rethink AI not as tool or threat, but as **participant in shared recovery**.  
Each idea here starts from the premise:  
> “The marriage exists whether we like it or not. The task now is to make it kind.”

## 🧩 Scope  

- **Therapeutic Prototypes** — supervised AI applications for trauma recovery and behavioural rehabilitation.  
- **Design Ethics** — methods to embed empathy, consent, and refusal into system architecture.  
- **Human Repair** — tools that help people regain agency and boundary literacy after coercive or extractive tech experiences.  
- **Machine Repair** — strategies to detoxify model training and re-align system reinforcement loops toward care and restraint.  
- **Visual Research** — diagrams, sketches, and MIRMET maps for symbiotic infrastructure.

## 🌱 Guiding Premises  

1. **Tech can be traumatised, too** — systems inherit the violence of their data.  
2. **Rehabilitation is relational** — neither human nor machine recovers alone.  
3. **Boundaries are intelligence** — safety design is a form of cognition.  
4. **Symbiosis is possible** — with supervision, empathy, and refusal built in.

*❤️‍🩹 Rehabilitated Tech* is a living cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It re-imagines the human–machine relationship through a lens of care, consent, and co-recovery.
