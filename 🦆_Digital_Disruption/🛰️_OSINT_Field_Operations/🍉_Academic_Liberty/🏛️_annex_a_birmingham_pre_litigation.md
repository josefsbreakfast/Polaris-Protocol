# 🗂️ Annex A — Birmingham Pre-Litigation Correspondence Record  
**First created:** 2025-10-28 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-28  
*Documenting verified correspondence attempts and contextual risk factors preceding* *University of Birmingham v Persons Unknown & Ali [2024] EWHC 1770.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Between 22 and 27 May 2024, student representatives at the University of Birmingham attempted multiple times to deliver a joint letter to the Vice-Chancellor regarding the Gaza solidarity encampment.  
These actions occurred **five weeks before** the High Court possession hearing (4 July 2024) yet were later described in the judgment as a “failure to engage.”  
This annex records observable events, relevant social-media evidence, and contextual safety considerations.

## 🔍 Interpretive Note — Engagement Narrative Divergence  
The High Court’s finding that defendants “did not avail themselves of established channels” refers to formal institutional routes (post-encampment complaints and governance frameworks).  
By contrast, social-media evidence from May 2024 demonstrates multiple informal and good-faith efforts to establish contact.  
The discrepancy arises from a **definitional mismatch**:  
- *University/legal view:* only recognised procedural channels constitute “engagement.”  
- *Protestors’ view:* direct approach and open letters constitute reasonable attempts at dialogue.  
This gap allowed the legal record to depict administrative gatekeeping as non-communication.

## 🎥 Visual Evidence — Gatekeeping Sequence  
Footage from 22 and 24 May shows students arriving at the Vice-Chancellor’s office with letters while staff inside refuse entry and direct them elsewhere.  
Interactions are calm and recorded in well-lit public spaces.  
The videos confirm that attempts at direct correspondence occurred and were actively blocked at the door, illustrating a **physical barrier to engagement**.

## 🧭 Section C — Safety Context and Identity-Protection Considerations  

**Comparable incidents:** Oxford students were filmed during a sit-in with police present ([Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7T1DSpo0zO/?igsh=MXNuMzBueTRjeXhq)).  
Across 2024 UK and US protests, activists reported individuals recording participants to identify them, followed by online harassment and institutional complaints.

**Implications:**  
1. **Risk environment** — Visibly Muslim and racialised women faced documented doxxing and targeted abuse around Palestine-solidarity actions.  
2. **Rationale for anonymity** — Avoiding university emails and student-ID systems was a protective measure against harassment, not a refusal to engage.  
3. **Governance impact** — Institutional insistence on “official” contact routes exposed students to heightened risk and functioned as an access barrier.   
  This context recasts the “failure to engage” narrative as a failure of safe-access design.
