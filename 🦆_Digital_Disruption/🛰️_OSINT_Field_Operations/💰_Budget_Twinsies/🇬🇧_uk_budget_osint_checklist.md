# 🇬🇧 UK Budget OSINT Checklist — Full Explicit Version  
**First created:** 2025-11-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-29  
*A forensic checklist for detecting whether the UK absorbed Israeli October 2025 war-budget bond exposure via public accounts.*

## 1. Compare Draft Budget vs Final Budget

Flag:
- sudden “revenue improvements”  
- adjustments without corresponding policy  
- unexplained billions reappearing  
- Chancellor statements contradicting tables

Discrepancies at the **£1–6bn level** are the danger zone:  
small enough to hide, large enough to matter in Israel’s bond call.

---

## 2. Red Book — Foreign Financial Transactions

Open the Red Book and check:

- **Net acquisition of financial assets**  
- **Debt securities (foreign)**  
- **Temporary liquidity operations**  
- **Other financial assets (non-sterling)**  
- **Public corporations — capital transfers**  

Look for vague language:
- “other instruments”  
- “revaluation adjustments”  
- “non-sterling holdings”  
- “external events”

These often mask sovereign exposure.

---

## 3. Whole of Government Accounts (WGA)

Check for:
- new foreign-currency asset categories  
- jumps in Level 2 or Level 3 assets  
- increases in “debt securities held”  
- transfers between central and local government

WGA is the place where hidden things become visible.

---

## 4. DMO Accounts

Search:
- trends in reserve diversification  
- temporary holdings of foreign sovereigns  
- currency swaps  
- “cash management operations”

Israel’s October 2025 issuance would produce obvious reserves movement if taken up at scale.

---

## 5. OBR Fiscal Notes

Look for:
- euphemistic phrases like “classification changes”  
- “unexpected receipts”  
- “external financing events”

OBR is often the only body that will quietly flag anomalies without naming the source.

---

## 6. LGPS (Council Pension Funds)

Check:
- new **Emerging Market Debt** mandates  
- increases in **Global Bonds** around Q3–Q4 2025  
- pooled funds known to include Israeli sovereign debt  
- synchronised changes across multiple councils

LGPS is historically the most convenient hiding place for small sovereign exposures.

---

## 7. Pooled Funds

Funds to check:
- BlackRock Global Bond Index  
- JP Morgan EM Debt  
- Barings Global Sovereign  
- PIMCO GIS Income  
- State Street EM Aggregate

Look for:
- jumps in subscriptions  
- new allocations to EM debt  
- benchmark changes adding Israel during the 2025 issuance window

---

## 8. UKEF (Export Finance)

Check if UKEF:
- backed any bond-like credit for Israeli counterparts  
- expanded callable capital  
- guaranteed quasi-sovereign Israeli entities  
- created new debt assumptions during the relevant quarter

This is a known backdoor for ally fiscal smoothing.

This checklist operationalises a high-resolution OSINT audit for determining whether Israel’s October 2025 sovereign-financing needs were quietly absorbed by the UK public sector. It is explicit, non-euphemistic, and built to detect small but meaningful foreign-debt placement across the fiscal system.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
