# 📃 SAR Template — University Surveillance & Contractor Data  
**First created:** 2025-11-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-08  
*A standard Subject Access Request (SAR) template for individuals seeking copies of personal data held by universities, security vendors, or risk-management contractors.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

Where FOI law reveals **public information**, a **Subject Access Request (SAR)** under **UK GDPR Article 15** allows any person to obtain **their own personal data** held by an organisation.  
This includes emails, logs, notes, and contractor reports that identify or reference them directly or indirectly.  

Since 2023, many universities have outsourced “risk-monitoring,” “threat-intelligence,” or “incident-management” functions to private companies.  
If your name, photograph, social-media handle, or student ID has appeared in those systems, you have the right to know **what data exists, where it came from, and who received it.**

## 🧩 2. Data Points to Request  

| Category | Why It Matters | Where It Might Reside |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **Incident reports / risk dashboards** | Identify protest-monitoring or Prevent-related flags. | Security or Estates systems, contractor dashboards. |
| **Social-media monitoring outputs** | Determine if public posts were scraped or analysed. | Contractor “threat-intel” platforms (Horus, Mitie, GSA). |
| **CCTV & access logs** | Show pattern-tracking of movement or presence. | DEMU / campus-security archives. |
| **Email mentions** | Reveal internal escalation discussions. | Staff mailboxes, Prevent leads. |
| **Data shared externally** | Check whether police or third parties accessed personal info. | Legal / Governance team records. |

---

## ⚖️ 3. Legal Framework  

| Article / Section | Title | Practical Meaning |
|--------------------|--------|------------------|
| **UK GDPR Art 15** | Right of Access | You can obtain confirmation, copies, and details of processing. |
| **UK GDPR Art 16–18** | Rectification / Erasure / Restriction | You can challenge inaccuracies and request deletion or limitation. |
| **DPA 2018 ss. 45–54** | Supplementary rules | Define time limits (one month) and exemptions. |
| **Exemptions to watch for** | “Crime and taxation,” “management forecasting,” “legal privilege.” | Must be specifically justified; cannot be used generically. |

If a university claims exemption, it must cite **which subsection** applies and **how disclosure would cause harm**—broad references to “security” or “management information” are insufficient.

## 🧠 4. Follow-Up Guidance  

1. **Acknowledgement:** Expect confirmation within 5 working days.  
2. **Deadline:** The full response must arrive within **one calendar month** (Art 12(3)); they may extend by two months for complex requests.  
3. **Partial responses:** If documents are withheld, request a written explanation specifying each exemption used.  
4. **Verification of identity:** They may request ID but cannot delay once verified.  
5. **Escalation:**  
   - If unsatisfied, file a complaint with the university’s DPO.  
   - Then appeal to the **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)** citing failure to comply with Article 15.

## 🌐 5. OSINT Integration  

SAR responses can be cross-checked with:  
- **Procurement databases** (Contracts Finder, Find a Tender) to identify vendors not disclosed.  
- **WhatDoTheyKnow** FOI results for the same institution.  
- **ICO decision notices** involving comparable data-processing.  

Mapping where your data appears (internal records vs external contractors) helps reveal the **data-transfer chain** between universities, vendors, and government.

*SAR Template — University Surveillance & Contractor Data* enables individuals to uncover whether their information has entered surveillance-adjacent systems.  
Used collectively, these requests form a civic audit trail of how universities and contractors process protest-related personal data.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
