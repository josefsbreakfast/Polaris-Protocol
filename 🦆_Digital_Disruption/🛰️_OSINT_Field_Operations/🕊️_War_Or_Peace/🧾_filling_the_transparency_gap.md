# 🧾 Filling the Transparency Gap — Methodological Companion Node  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-08  
*Companion to the UoN–Israel Security Ecosystem Gap Map. Lists the kinds of data, records, and evidence that would exist in a transparent research-security ecosystem, and how to locate them ethically through open sources.*

---

This node sits within the *War Or Peace* cluster as an **OSINT-for-policing-and-security companion**.  
It maps how transparency failures around campus security, policing liaison, and protest discipline can be examined through open data.  
Readers of *Polaris* are invited to contribute lawful, open-source intelligence (OSINT) that increases visibility of these systems — relieving pressure on the students who are already carrying much of this evidential work while studying, working, and living under surveillance risk.

A significant output of the *Nottingham Camp for the Liberation of Palestine* was a pair of student-authored research reports analysing the university’s protest-policing and security environment.  
Both are publicly available via **[linktr.ee/nottspalestinecamp](https://linktr.ee/nottspalestinecamp)** and should be treated as core reference materials for this node.  
They demonstrate the depth of student-led investigative work already underway and set a benchmark for external OSINT contributors.

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node translates the “hole in the middle” from the **UoN–Israel Security Ecosystem — Open-Source Gap Map** into a set of practical evidence categories.  
It shows what documents, datasets, and oversight materials *should* exist openly from stakeholders, if a university’s defence, Israel, or security partnerships were fully transparent, and how each could be surfaced via lawful OSINT and archival work.  

---

## 🎓 Context  

The transparency work documented here builds on **years of student and staff requests** for clarity about UK universities’ financial and research relationships with arms manufacturers and, more specifically, with entities linked to the **Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory**.  
These demands did not begin with the Gaza escalation of October 2023; they form part of a longer campus ethics movement that asks universities to apply the same human-rights standards they promote in their marketing and teaching.  

At the University of Nottingham and elsewhere, students have repeatedly asked for:  
- publication of contracts and research partnerships with defence or surveillance companies;  
- disclosure of any commercial or academic arrangements with institutions operating in the Palestinian lands which remain under an illegal military occupation;  
- explanation of how such relationships align with universities’ public commitments to human rights, environmental responsibility, and ethical investment.  

The **core grievance** is not merely political alignment, but **inconsistency of practice**: institutions present themselves as centres of humanitarian and environmental values while maintaining opaque financial or research ties that may contradict those values.  
After the **International Court of Justice’s provisional measures** on the Gaza situation (January 2024), students argued that transparency was no longer optional—it was a **legal and moral requirement** under the Genocide Convention’s duty to prevent harm.  

This node therefore situates the current OSINT work inside that longer accountability tradition: a civic request for evidence, not a campaign of hostility.  

It is also noted throughout this section of Polaris, that universities do not exist as institutions without multiple stakeholders and influences; the proposed OSINT tasks therefore look at a broad range of factors which may contribute to a given university's threat or risk assessment, when confronted with demands for transparency, and what may motivate the current positioning of many UK universities in the current time.

## 🧩 1. Contractual & Financial Transparency Layer  

| Missing or Obscured Item | What It Would Show | How It Normally Appears |
|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Defence & security contract lists** | Named partners (e.g., BAE, Rolls-Royce, Elbit), project titles, contract values, durations | Annual procurement reports, FOI disclosures, Companies House filings |
| **Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)** | Formal R&D or data-sharing agreements with defence or Israeli institutions | Partnership announcements, Senate or Council minutes |
| **Tender / bid documentation** | Which labs bid for UKRI, Innovate UK, or Home Office security grants | Contracts Finder, ResearchFish, Gateway to Research |
| **Commercialisation agreements (NTV / incubator)** | Spin-outs licensing or selling IP relevant to surveillance or defence | Nottingham Technology Ventures annual reports |
| **Charitable donations & endowments** | Donor origins and purpose of funds | University financial statements and gift registers |

**Gap meaning:** absence of these records prevents tracing the money and decision-making that link humanitarian branding with military funding streams.

---

## 🧪 2. Research & Data-Governance Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Ethics-committee summaries** | Which projects underwent review for dual-use or security risks | REC archives, project webpages |
| **Data-sharing agreements (DSAs)** | Ownership and access rights for remote-sensing or behavioural datasets | Attached to deliverables or data repositories |
| **Security-classification notices** | Whether outputs are export-controlled or restricted | Research contracts, export-control disclosures |
| **Publication embargo notes** | Reasons for delay or partial release | Journal metadata or repository records |
| **Data-protection impact assessments (DPIAs)** | Risk assessments for sensitive-population data | GDPR compliance records |

**Gap meaning:** opacity here implies data streams may be operating under commercial or classified protection rather than open academic scrutiny.

---

## 🧠 3. Governance & Oversight Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Minutes of Partnerships / Ethics Boards** | Who approved high-risk collaborations | Council or Senate minutes |
| **Conflict-of-interest registers** | Equity or advisory roles in spin-outs | Annual declarations, charity filings |
| **Prevent / Security liaison papers** | Institutional alignment with national-security policies | FOI responses, internal governance frameworks |
| **Community-engagement frameworks** | How protest or dissent is formally addressed | Equality & Human Rights Impact Assessments, policy docs |

**Gap meaning:** absence of governance documentation means oversight may be internalised and shielded from stakeholder accountability.

---

## 🌍 4. International & Policy Interface Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Foreign-research collaboration statements** | Bilateral research with Israeli institutions beyond BIRAX | UKRI / BEIS databases |
| **Export-licence declarations** | Hardware or software subject to export control | UK Export Control Joint Unit public filings |
| **FCDO / Home Office grant data** | Government security or CVE funding flows | ODA or National Security Science and Technology records |
| **NGO / inter-agency audits** | Third-party verification of humanitarian vs security usage | NGO or UN audit reports |

**Gap meaning:** a blank policy interface hides how civilian research feeds national-security objectives.

---

## 📊 5. Civic & Social Accountability Layer  

| Missing / Obscured Item | What It Would Show | Expected Source |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Community-impact statements** | Local or diasporic effects of security partnerships | Council or university community reports |
| **Complaint / whistleblower statistics** | Handling of dissent or harm | Governance statements |
| **Equality Impact Assessments** | Evaluation of bias or discrimination risks | EDI office documentation |
| **Student-disciplinary transparency** | Protest-related disciplinary data | Senate or Council annual reports |

**Gap meaning:** without this layer, the local democratic feedback loop is invisible.  

---

## 🔍 6. Methods to Begin Filling the Gap (Open & Ethical)  

1. **FOI / EIR** — Request aggregated defence-funding data, partnership lists, DPIAs, and redacted committee minutes.  
2. **UKRI Gateway to Research mining** — Filter by security, dual-use, counter-terrorism, or Israel tags; export results to CSV.  
3. **Companies House & incubator filings** — Identify spin-outs, shareholders, and PSC overlaps.  
4. **Export-control database search** — Cross-check university entities against ECJU public licence lists.  
5. **Minutes & board papers via FOI** — Test whether ethics boards discussed security collaborations.  
6. **Community-impact mapping** — Match contract or grant dates with protest crackdowns and media coverage.  

Each task can be performed entirely within open-source and legal bounds.

### 🧭 Ethical Framing for Contributors  

This OSINT stream focuses on **policing, security, and disciplinary transparency**.  
All work must remain within open, public sources: published records, archived web pages, procurement databases, and lawful FOI or EIR requests.  
**Do not** attempt intrusion or unauthorised access.  
The purpose is civic verification — to illuminate governance and data-flow structures so that universities, governments, and students can share a common factual ground.  

By widening the field of investigators beyond those directly affected, outside contributors also **reduce the personal risk borne by students** and help distribute the evidential burden across the wider community.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🧾 Filling the Transparency Gap — Methodological Companion Node* expands on the open-source gap-map methodology.  
It outlines the documentary strata that a transparent institution would make visible, and provides lawful ways to surface missing evidence using only public records.  

It explicitly acknowledges and builds upon the student-authored reports released by the *Nottingham Camp for the Liberation of Palestine*, available via [linktr.ee/nottspalestinecamp](https://linktr.ee/nottspalestinecamp).  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
