*Field-operations cluster tracing Britain’s shift toward wartime logic under peacetime law.*
<!--People appear surprised when I have concerns or challenges towardes my civil government as a British Jew, so I made you this.  
I am not absolving other parties; I am asking us to get our own house in order to better resist the rising and decentralised influence of the alt-right and authoritarian power.  
I am not a fan.-->

## 🧭 Orientation  
This sub-folder of **🛰️ OSINT Field Operations** gathers open-source intelligence and civic-forensic analysis documenting how the UK’s administrative and policing posture has resembled a wartime state since October 2023 — without any formal declaration of war.  

It examines the intersection of law, policy, and lived civic impact:  
- Legislative changes expanding national-security reach.  
- FOI refusal patterns (sections 24 & 36).  
- Media suppression, delist, and DSMA-style interventions.  
- Community-level consequences for protest, journalism, and academic freedom.
