# 👾 Synthetic Mobilisation and Petition Farms  
**First created:** 2025-11-02  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*How digital bot networks simulate public will — and why civic infrastructure must learn to detect synthetic mobilisation.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Online petitions and hashtag campaigns now function as *shadow parliaments*.  
They generate visible numbers — signatures, retweets, views — that are mistaken for democratic consent.  
In reality, a significant fraction of this “engagement” originates from **bot farms**, **click factories**, and **cross-promotional influencer networks**.  

Synthetic mobilisation converts *noise into narrative power* — a key tactic in hybrid influence operations.

---

## ✨ Background  

### 1. From Social Metrics to Civic Metrics  
Early digital platforms rewarded posts that provoked reaction.  
Petition systems adopted the same logic: count signatures, display velocity, show trending totals.  
This made petitions easy to game — the platform treats a bot click the same as a voter’s signature.

### 2. Petition Farms  
- **Infrastructure:** low-cost automation scripts (Selenium, Puppeteer, API spoofers).  
- **Labour:** “click farms” in low-wage economies running paid browser sessions.  
- **Finance:** often funded through ad-revenue laundering or cryptocurrency markets.  
- **Output:** apparent grassroots campaigns, frequently cross-linked with polarising hashtags.  

### 3. Botnet Behavioural Traits  
| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Velocity spikes** | Thousands of sign-ups within seconds of influencer amplification. |
| **Geographic anomalies** | Signature IPs from outside target jurisdiction. |
| **Lexical uniformity** | Identical phrasing in captions or bios (“Save our country”, “Sack the government”). |
| **Dormant-to-active pattern** | Old dormant accounts activated in synchrony. |
| **Short tail engagement** | Massive launch, no sustained conversation afterwards. |

## ⚙️ Case Study — The 2024 “General Election Now” Petition  

- Surpassed **2 million** signatures within days of being boosted by high-follower accounts, including Elon Musk.  
- Forensic review showed many sign-ups from **non-UK IP ranges** and **VPN endpoints**.  
- Growth curve followed a *bot-style burst*: vertical escalation → plateau → decay.  
- Demonstrates how external amplification can simulate civic crisis without domestic consensus.

## 🧮 Analytical Framework  

1. **Velocity Analysis:** compare signature jumps to platform bandwidth; >5 % total/minute = synthetic risk.  
2. **Geospatial Entropy:** count distinct postcodes or constituencies. Low diversity = centralised automation.  
3. **Amplifier Mapping:** cross-reference top sharers, follower age, retweet patterns.  
4. **Linguistic Drift:** note uniform phrasing; automated posts use fewer synonyms.  
5. **Persistence Test:** organic campaigns sustain engagement beyond initial trend.

## 🧾 Governance and Platform Responsibility  

- **Verification thresholds:** require minimal identity validation for civic petitions.  
- **Transparency dashboards:** real-time country and IP summaries.  
- **Bot-activity disclosure:** platforms must flag coordinated automation.  
- **Public education:** teach signature-velocity literacy; “viral ≠ democratic.”

## 🌍 Broader Implications  

Synthetic mobilisation corrodes democratic feedback loops.  
Governments respond to *metrics*, not *citizens*; journalists report the numbers; the numbers were never human.  
As language itself becomes a programmable interface, civic systems must evolve **verification literacy** — the ability to read the authenticity of participation.
