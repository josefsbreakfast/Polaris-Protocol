# 👾 Chan-Style Petitioning  

**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*A focused OSINT field pack for detecting synthetic mobilisation and verifying the integrity of digital petitions.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

The **Chan-Style Petitioning** sub-cluster studies how online influence ecosystems mimic democratic participation.  
It examines how petitions, hashtags, and “viral” movements are engineered through **bot farms**, **automation scripts**, and **culture-war amplification networks**, producing the illusion of popular will.  

This directory combines **background analysis** and **operational OSINT methods** so investigators, journalists, and civic researchers can trace authenticity in real time.

## 📂 Contents  

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| [🕵️‍♀️ Synthetic Mobilisation and Petition Farms](🕵️‍♀️_synthetic_mobilisation_and_petition_farms.md) | Analytical overview: explains how petition-farms and botnets simulate civic engagement and distort metrics. |
| [🕵️‍♀️ OSINT for Petition Integrity](🕵️‍♀️_osint_for_petition_integrity.md) | Practical field guide: reproducible open-source workflow to verify petitions using JSON data, velocity analysis, and amplifier mapping. |

## 🧩 Usage  

1. **Start with the background node** to understand how synthetic mobilisation operates.  
2. **Move to the OSINT guide** to perform verification on any live petition or viral campaign.  
3. **Archive responsibly:** follow the `🧾 Archive Capture Template` and `🪞 Cross-Mirroring SOP` for data integrity.  
4. **Report findings** through transparent public notes, not speculative claims — the purpose is *verification literacy*, not viral counter-activism.

## 🧠 Field Indicators  

- Velocity spikes (> 5 % total signatures per minute).  
- Non-resident IP clusters or excessive “unknown” locations.  
- Identical sharing text across multiple platforms.  
- Dormant accounts re-activated during campaign peaks.  
- No sustained conversation after initial surge.  

Use these as triage signals before deeper investigation.

*👾 Chan-Style Petitioning* is part of the **OSINT Field Operations** cluster in *🦆 Digital Disruption*.  
It equips investigators to differentiate authentic civic engagement from synthetic campaigns and to preserve public trust in digital participation.
