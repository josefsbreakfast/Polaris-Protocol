# 🪩 Public Faces, Hidden Files — Reading the Visibility Layer  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-12  
*A methodological note on how bilateral academic networks display openness while keeping their operational core opaque.*

## 🧭 Framing  
Every bilateral or diplomatic research programme maintains a **front stage** of visible people and events: chairs, advisers, press photos, and ceremonial statements.  
Visibility builds legitimacy, but it also acts as a **containment layer** — signalling transparency without disclosing internal mechanics.

---

## 🧩 The Public Faces  

1. **Chairs & Co-Chairs** – senior academics or former ministers who give credibility.  
2. **Advisory-Board Members** – representatives from partner universities, research councils, or cultural bodies.  
3. **Embassy Science & Innovation Attachés** – career diplomats who manage day-to-day coordination.  
4. **British Council / Programme Officers** – civil-service counterparts handling grants and events.  

These names are normally published on websites, event posters, or in parliamentary briefings.  
They are not secret — but they frame the partnership as benign and cooperative.

## 🔍 Using the Visibility Layer  

| OSINT Step | What to Look For | Why It Matters |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Identify leadership names | Council websites, embassy releases, LinkedIn | Anchor points for mapping institutional ties |
| Cross-reference affiliations | University pages, company registers | Reveals which UK institutions carry influence |
| Archive statements | Press releases, YouTube events, PDFs | Date-stamped record of what was promised |
| Trace symmetry | Find equivalent roles in partner country | Confirms bilateral structure and funding flow |
| Compare rhetoric vs. output | Match speeches to project databases | Shows divergence between myth and mechanism |

## 🕳️ Hidden Files Beneath  

Beyond those public layers lie the documents almost never released:  

- **Grant-by-grant funding totals** and expenditure audits.  
- **Meeting minutes** between attachés and vice-chancellors.  
- **Data-sharing agreements** and **export-control assessments**.  
- **Security-service consultations** or red-team briefings.  

These are the areas where Freedom of Information requests or parliamentary questions are required to surface details.

## 🧭 Ethical Boundary  

Visible individuals should be treated as **sources of structural information**, not personal targets.  
The goal is to map **process**, not assign **blame**.  
Archive public data; do not pursue private communications.

*🪩 Public Faces, Hidden Files* describes the paradox of openness in international research diplomacy:  
the more visible the personalities, the less visible the paperwork.  
Recognising this pattern helps investigators use public data without mistaking performance for transparency.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
