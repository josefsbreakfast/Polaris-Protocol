## 🧭 Framing — How the Twin Project Model Works  

In many international research partnerships, two parallel projects evolve:  

1. **The Public Project** — the visible, press-friendly collaboration framed around medical or humanitarian goals.  
2. **The Shadow Project** — the less visible or entirely undisclosed work that leverages the same infrastructure for commercial, military, or extractive use.  

This dual structure allows institutions to perform transparency while maintaining secrecy, satisfying both diplomatic optics and defence or corporate confidentiality.  

Academics across regions report that these arrangements are *standard practice* in bilateral programmes that touch national-security interests.

## ⚙️ Mechanism — How the Pair Is Built  

| Stage | Public Project | Shadow Project |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Funding source** | public grants, charities, bilateral science funds | defence contracts, corporate R&D, NDAs |
| **Visibility** | press releases, embassy visits, journal papers | restricted outputs, classified data |
| **Framing** | humanitarian or scientific benefit | national-security or commercial application |
| **Governance** | ethics committees, public reporting | export control, security clearance, NDA |
| **Labour** | university researchers, students | same teams plus private-sector partners |
| **Outcome** | publications, patents, conferences | proprietary algorithms, defence prototypes |

The same people and datasets often serve both sides; the distinction lies in who may see or reuse the results.

## 🧩 Case Type — The Shopfront and Its Shadow  

In the BIRAX / UK–Israel Science Council example:  
- The **shopfront** is the medical-research portfolio (stem-cell regeneration, diabetes, Parkinson’s).  
- The **shadow** may involve derivative data-analytics or AI pipelines developed under separate funding streams (Innovate UK, EPSRC, or defence-innovation grants).  

The public layer legitimises the partnership; the restricted layer monetises or securitises it.

## 🧠 Why It Matters — Academic Ethics and BDS Logic  

This pattern underpins calls for **boycott, divestment, and sanctions** in academia.  
Researchers argue that participation in apparently benign projects legitimises — and may indirectly resource — surveillance or occupation infrastructures hidden behind NDAs.  

Without full transparency, ethical review collapses: universities cannot verify where data go, who profits, or whether results are weaponised.  
Boycott becomes the only remaining instrument of accountability.

## 🔍 Recognising the Signs  

1. **Missing documentation** — ethics approvals or DPIAs referenced but not published.  
2. **Abrupt embargoes** — project results delayed indefinitely after completion.  
3. **Split funding** — a single lab credited to two grants with different oversight bodies.  
4. **Dual investigators** — one PI with a defence or corporate affiliation.  
5. **Identical datasets** — same images or patient data reused across medical and security papers.  
6. **Language drift** — vocabulary shifting from “care” to “control,” “diagnostic” to “detection.”  

Each is a tracer of the hidden half.

## 🧭 Analytical Lens  

The twin-project model is not unique to any country; it is a global structure of **scientific containment**.  
It allows democracies to appear open while outsourcing coercive or exploitative functions to “research.”  
Understanding it is essential to evaluating claims of neutrality in science diplomacy.

## 🏮 Footer  

*The Public Project and the Shadow Project* documents a recurring architecture of academic diplomacy: one layer for display, another for control.  
It is written to aid civic investigators, scholars, and policymakers in recognising how ethical rhetoric can mask exploitative practice.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
