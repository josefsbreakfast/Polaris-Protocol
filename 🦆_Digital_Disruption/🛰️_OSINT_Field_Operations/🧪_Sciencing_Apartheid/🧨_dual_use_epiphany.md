*Social and institutional conditions that make dual-use convergence plausible.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
This node describes the **social, contractual, and bureaucratic pathways** by which well-intentioned civilian projects drift into dual-use or coercive domains.

It frames the *preconditions* for the Dual-Use Frankenstack: not the machinery itself, but the ecosystem that allows it to form.

---

## 🧩 Conditions for Convergence

1. **Procurement blur:** Defence, policing, and healthcare share common vendor ecosystems.
2. **Contractual plasticity:** Deliverables written to permit “security applications” of civilian research.
3. **Funding rhetoric:** Terms like “resilience,” “stability,” and “well-being” mask dual agendas.
4. **Data interoperability fetish:** Technical convenience outweighs ethical containment.
5. **Policy theatre:** Ministers and funders reward visibility over outcome.
6. **Academic capture:** Universities absorb surveillance money via “impact” pathways.
7. **Moral disengagement gradient:** Each actor does a small part; no one sees the totality.

## 🧠 Social Logic

- **Normalization:** Once data-sharing is “for health,” security use feels incremental.
- **Fragmentation:** Subcontracts prevent any single actor from perceiving the whole coercive logic.
- **Obedience economics:** Staff comply with flawed orders to keep projects afloat.
- **Rhetorical laundering:** “Safety” and “innovation” language erases coercive edges.
