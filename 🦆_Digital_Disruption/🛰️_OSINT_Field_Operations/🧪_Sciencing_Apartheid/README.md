# 🧪 Sciencing Apartheid — Field Operations Index  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*An OSINT field-lab documenting how research, innovation, and security ecosystems reproduce global hierarchies and exclusions.*

---

## 🧭 Purpose  

`🧪_Sciencing_Apartheid` sits inside  
`🦆_Digital_Disruption/🛰️_OSINT_Field_Operations`  
as a **specialised investigative workspace** for examining:  

- how scientific or academic collaborations align with systems of occupation, segregation, or techno-nationalism;  
- how funding, innovation branding, and data infrastructures may sustain unequal power relations;  
- how to study those patterns using **ethical, open-source** methods only.  

The folder’s guiding question:  
> *When science is entangled with empire or apartheid logics, what evidence trails remain visible in the open data layer?*

## 📁 Current Contents  

| File | Function |
|------|-----------|
| `🔍_search_protocol_bilateral_funding_phrase_mapping.md` | Step-by-step protocol for tracing institutional networks through funding acknowledgements (“supported by the UK–Israel Science Council”). |

Future additions may include:  
- field logs of specific search results,  
- network diagrams of institutional relationships,  
- analysis notes linking OSINT findings to larger Polaris clusters.

## 🧩 Methods  

1. **Use only publicly available data** (grant databases, press releases, institutional repositories).  
2. **Aggregate by institution**, not by individual researcher.  
3. **Record provenance** for every data point (URL, access date).  
4. **Archive responsibly** — no scraped personal data or unpublished material.  
5. **Analyse comparatively** — look for systemic patterns, not isolated cases.

## 🧠 Analytical Themes  

- Science diplomacy as soft power  
- Academic complicity and extractive knowledge economies  
- Data colonialism and dual-use technology  
- Transparency gaps in bilateral research funding  
- Civic and ethical accountability in innovation policy

## 🏮 Footer  

*🧪 Sciencing Apartheid* is a living field node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It provides a controlled environment for testing how open-source investigation can illuminate the entanglement of research, funding, and occupation logics without breaching ethics or law.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
