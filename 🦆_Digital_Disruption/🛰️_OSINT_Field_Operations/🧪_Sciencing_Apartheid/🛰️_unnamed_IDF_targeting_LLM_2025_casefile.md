# 🛰️ Unnamed IDF Targeting LLM (2025) — Open-Source Case File  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-07  
*Summarises what is publicly known about an unnamed Israeli military large-language-model-based targeting and surveillance system first described by* The Guardian, +972 Magazine & Local Call (March 2025).  

---

## 🧭 Disclosure provenance  
- **Publication:** *The Guardian* / +972 Magazine / *Local Call*, 6 March 2025.  
- **Authors:** Yuval Abraham et al.  
- **Nature of system:** “ChatGPT-like” LLM trained on intercepted Arabic-language communications to assist analysts in querying surveillance data.  
- **Codename:** *Not disclosed* (distinct from later-reported systems *Lavender*, *Gospel*, *Where’s Daddy?*).  
- **Status:** training and internal testing during late 2024; deployment unconfirmed.

## ⚙️ Publicly described functionality  

| Capability | Evidence from reporting | Technical inference |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **LLM-style interface** | “ChatGPT-like tool … capable of answering questions about people it is monitoring.” | Conversational query layer over a structured SIGINT database or knowledge graph. |
| **Training corpus** | “Large volumes of intercepted Palestinian telephone conversations and text messages.” | Transformer model trained on speech-to-text Arabic intercepts; fine-tuned for named-entity recognition. |
| **Purpose** | To analyse intercepted data and provide insights into surveillance holdings. | Decision-support for analyst triage and profiling. |
| **Data scope** | “All the data the state of Israel has ever had in Arabic.” | Foundation-model scale corpus (≈ 10¹¹ tokens). |
| **Dialects & terminology** | Model focused on Palestinian / Lebanese dialects and militant terminology. | Domain-specific embeddings for regional vernacular and security lexicon. |
| **Development team** | Reservist AI engineers from Israeli tech sector recalled during mobilisation. | Hybrid civilian–military build; open-source LLM frameworks on secure networks. |

## 🧮 Functional summary  
**Core role:** automated summarisation and retrieval of intercepted communications for human analysts.  
**Inputs:** voice and text intercepts in Arabic dialects.  
**Process:** speech-to-text → embedding → entity-linking → LLM query.  
**Outputs:** natural-language dossiers and analytic answers about individuals or groups.  
**Integration:** likely connected to Unit 8200’s existing SIGINT and geospatial systems.

## ⚖️ Reported ethical and legal concerns  
- **Privacy & legality:** surveillance of civilians under occupation without consent.  
- **Bias amplification:** model may equate emotional language with threat behaviour.  
- **Opacity:** analysts cannot interrogate model reasoning.  
- **Operational risk:** false correlations (“hallucinations”) could lead to wrongful suspicion or targeting.  

---

## 🧩 Analytical significance  
- Serves as the **conceptual bridge** between Unit 8200’s language-model R&D and later combat-AI tools (*Lavender* suite).  
- Exemplifies the *Public Project / Shadow Project* dynamic: military LLM built on civilian linguistic research.  
- Illustrates how generative-AI architectures migrate from open innovation ecosystems into closed surveillance regimes.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Unnamed IDF Targeting LLM (2025) — Open-Source Case File* records only information published in mainstream media and verified investigative outlets.  
It exists to map how generative-AI infrastructures are deployed in intelligence contexts and to provide civic-research baselines for ethical oversight.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
