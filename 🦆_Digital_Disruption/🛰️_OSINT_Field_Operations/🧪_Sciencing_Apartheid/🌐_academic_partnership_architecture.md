## 🧭 Framing — The Architecture of Cooperation  

When a foreign country establishes academic or research ties with the United Kingdom, it rarely happens through a single actor.  
Instead, it forms a **stacked architecture**: diplomatic, bureaucratic, and academic layers that each manage part of the relationship.  
This structure makes collaboration possible but also obscures accountability — useful for diplomacy, difficult for transparency.

Each node represents a recurring institutional actor in bilateral academic cooperation.  
The lines show typical information or contract flow, not legal hierarchy.

## 🧩 Layer Descriptions  

### 1. **Foreign Ministry Layer**  
Origin point for policy and funding mandates. Oversees embassies and national research councils.  

### 2. **Embassy / High Commission Layer**  
Hosts education, culture, and science attachés. They negotiate memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and coordinate visits.  

### 3. **Intermediary Programmes**  
Bodies such as the **British Council**, **Newton Fund**, or **UK–Israel Science Council** co‑fund research and run grant competitions.  

### 4. **UK Government Departments**  
Departments for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) or the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) may co‑sign frameworks or provide oversight.  

### 5. **University Global Engagement Offices**  
Institution‑level managers who negotiate, draft, and monitor partnerships; they form the internal counterpart to embassy staff.  

### 6. **Universities UK International (UUKi)**  
Sector‑wide coordination body that aggregates data, best practices, and advocacy for internationalisation.  

### 7. **Operational Mechanisms**  
Faculty or research centres implement projects and exchange programmes under MOUs, sometimes creating spin‑outs or joint labs.

## 🔍 Tracing or Auditing the Network  

| Evidence Type | Where to Look | Typical Source |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Memoranda of Understanding | University partnership registers, FOI requests | Global Engagement Office |
| Embassy or Attaché listings | Embassy websites, diplomatic directories | Foreign mission pages |
| Funding agreements | Grants.gov.uk, British Council, DSIT / FCDO portals | Public contract databases |
| Project deliverables | ResearchFish, Gateway to Research | UKRI or partner databases |
| Meeting minutes | University Council / Senate, bilateral committees | FOI or public governance pages |

These records show how diplomatic intent turns into research contracts, revealing both transparency and influence gaps.
