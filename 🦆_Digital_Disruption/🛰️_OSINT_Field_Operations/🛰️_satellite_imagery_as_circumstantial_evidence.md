# 🛰️ Satellite Imagery as Circumstantial Evidence

*How geospatial anomalies function as corroborative evidence in closed systems*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node defines the **proper evidentiary role of satellite imagery** in human-rights, conflict, and governance investigations.

Satellite imagery is not used to prove individual acts of violence in isolation. Its value lies in **corroboration, anomaly detection, and burden-shifting** when physical access, records, or testimony are restricted.

In closed or rights-void systems, imagery often becomes one of the few remaining independent observation channels.

## 🧭 Evidentiary Status: What Satellite Imagery Is (and Is Not)

### What It Is

* Circumstantial evidence
* Corroborative signal
* Temporal change detector
* Access-denial validator

### What It Is Not

* Direct proof of specific crimes
* Standalone forensic confirmation
* Substitute for witness testimony

Misuse occurs when imagery is treated as dispositive rather than contextual.

## 🧩 How Imagery Enters Serious Investigations

In academic, legal, and OSINT practice, satellite imagery is typically used to:

1. **Establish Baselines**
   Document normal conditions prior to a policy shift, transfer, or operational change.

2. **Detect Temporal Anomalies**
   Identify changes in terrain, structures, surface patterns, or activity over time.

3. **Corroborate Testimony**
   Support or challenge witness accounts without replacing them.

4. **Flag Sites for Inspection**
   Justify access demands or moratoria when anomalies coincide with restricted access.

5. **Shift the Burden of Explanation**
   Require custodial authorities to explain changes when independent verification is blocked.

## 🛰️ Resolution and Modality Constraints

Publicly accessible imagery (e.g. Google Earth, Google Maps) has significant limits:

* low spatial resolution
* irregular update intervals
* limited spectral bands

Higher-grade analysis typically relies on:

* commercial providers (e.g. Maxar, Planet)
* multi-temporal sequences
* multispectral or thermal bands

Failure to acknowledge resolution limits leads to overclaiming.

## ⚖️ Why Imagery Matters in Rights-Void Contexts

When a facility:

* denies independent access
* restricts visitation
* obscures rosters or locations

satellite imagery becomes **procedural evidence** that:

* the system is closed by design
* verification is being prevented
* oversight mechanisms are non-functional

In such cases, imagery does not accuse — it *questions*.

---

## 🌀 Integration with the Rule-of-Law Failure Cascade

Satellite imagery often becomes relevant at **Stages 3–5** of the failure cascade:

* responsibility fragmentation
* traceability loss
* outcome unverifiability

At these stages, imagery helps establish that opacity is not accidental.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Discipline

Responsible use requires:

* clear statement of limits
* avoidance of speculative language
* cross-referencing with independent sources
* separation of observation from inference

Strong analysis makes uncertainty visible rather than hiding it.

---

## 🔥 Risk Indicators (Non-Exhaustive)

Imagery may raise concern when combined with other evidence showing:

* rapid surface alteration in closed facilities
* unexplained construction or earth movement
* changes coinciding with mass transfers
* expansion without corresponding transparency

These indicators **trigger inquiry**, not conclusions.

---

## 🧭 Analytical Use

This node should be used to:

* contextualise OSINT discussions
* defend against accusations of overreach
* explain why access denial itself is evidentiary
* support calls for inspection and disclosure

Satellite imagery strengthens cases where states rely on silence.
