# 🧿 OSINT Guide — Checking Whether Research or Tech Projects Are Community-Led  
**First created:** 2025-11-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-08  
*A field guide for open-source investigators: how to tell if a project claiming humanitarian or social-impact aims is actually community-driven or extractive.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node is designed for analysts, journalists, and civic researchers using **open-source intelligence (OSINT)** methods to verify whether a research or technology project is genuinely community-led or mainly serving institutional, commercial, or colonial interests.  

It stays in the **public-evidence zone** — everything listed here can be confirmed via grant databases, contracts, company registers, published ethics statements, or official reports.

## 🧩 Part 1 — What *Good* Looks Like  

Use these as positive indicators. A credible community-led project will usually show several of them at once.

1. **Named local partners** — local NGOs, universities, or councils appear as co-applicants or co-investigators on the grant.  
2. **Participatory design** — published evidence of workshops or consultation in local languages; local co-authors on papers.  
3. **Benefit-sharing** — budgets for training, equipment, or local staff; transparent hand-over or co-ownership clauses.  
4. **Data sovereignty** — agreements defining who owns, stores, and can access the data; local data custodians listed.  
5. **Transparent ethics** — REC/IRB numbers publicly cited, with risk-mitigation summaries.  
6. **Follow-up accountability** — later reports showing outcomes for communities, not just for funders.  
7. **Funding clarity** — visible grant number, funder name, and plain statement of intended beneficiaries.

## 🧨 Part 2 — Red Flags (Extraction or Colonial Logic)  

- “Field site” or “data source” listed but **no local institutional partner**.  
- No public ethics statement or REC reference.  
- Data stored solely on home-institution servers; no local access rights.  
- Very short project duration with no capacity-building component.  
- Presence of **defence, security, or surveillance partners** without human-rights explanation.  
- Language like “bringing technology to help them” rather than “co-developing with…”.

## 🔍 Part 3 — Quick OSINT Checks  

All verifiable with free, open tools.

| Evidence Type | Where to Look | What You’re Checking |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Grant record** | UKRI Gateway to Research, NIHR, Innovate UK, Horizon Europe | Are local partners named? Is budget split visible? |
| **Clinical or field trials** | ISRCTN, clinicaltrials.gov | Are recruitment sites and PPI groups listed? |
| **Ethics approvals** | Project webpages, journal articles | Is there a REC/IRB code and public summary? |
| **Consortium docs** | PDF proposals, ResearchFish outputs | Do local partners have their own work packages? |
| **Outputs for community** | NGO reports, training manuals, translated guides | Are materials accessible to participants? |
| **Company registers** | Companies House, OpenCorporates | Are local entities shareholders or contract partners? |
| **Job ads** | Project or university sites | Are there jobs for local hires, not only UK-based staff? |

## 📨 Part 4 — Questions You Can Safely Ask  

Use for FOI, EIR, or polite inquiry emails.

1. *“Please provide the project partners named in grant [X] and any MOU or contract with local organisations.”*  
2. *“Please provide the project’s REC/IRB reference and a summary of key ethical mitigations (data ownership, consent process).”*  
3. *“Were funds allocated specifically for local capacity-building or personnel? If so, what total and which organisations?”*  
4. *“Are there data-sharing agreements that stipulate local data custody and access rights?”*  

---

## 🧱 Part 5 — Build-Your-Own Evidence Stack  

1. **Save PDFs** of grant abstracts, ethics approvals, and project deliverables.  
2. **Screenshot partner lists** and archive URLs (Wayback Machine, perma.cc).  
3. **Cross-reference** dates of protests, contracts, and announcements.  
4. **Note** discrepancies between PR claims and grant language.  
5. **Log** each source with date accessed, using Polaris Field Log schema.

*OSINT Guide — Checking Whether Research or Tech Projects Are Community-Led* is a living Polaris Protocol field node.  
It offers a structured way to separate genuine participatory practice from extractive or colonial logics, using only publicly verifiable data.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
