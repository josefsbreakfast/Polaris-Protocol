## 🧭 Orientation

This node translates the *Pitch @ Palace* case into a **transparency exercise kit**.  
It teaches how to request information *lawfully, politely, and persistently* using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA 2000) and Subject Access Requests (SARs under UK GDPR).  

It does **not** assume wrongdoing.  
It assumes curiosity — and that every democratic citizen deserves to understand how prestige networks handle public interfaces.  

---

## 🧩 Why This Matters

Open-source investigation is most effective when it’s lawful and boring.  
FOIs and SARs are not weapons; they are instruments of civic calibration.  
Every exemption, every delay, every “we do not hold that information” becomes metadata: it tells us where governance resistance lives.  

---

## 🗂️ Part I – FOI Templates

Each example can be adapted for date ranges or departments.  
Keep tone neutral, cite FOIA 2000, and record every reference number for later mapping.  

### 🏛️ 1. Department for Business & Trade (DBT / ex-DIT / UKTI)
```

Please provide copies of:
• Briefing notes, MoUs, or correspondence between DBT and Pitch @ Palace Ltd or CIC.  
• Any guidance regarding royal involvement in trade-promotion activities.  
• Risk assessments or due-diligence checks relating to event sponsorship.  
```

### 🌍 2. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)

### 🧠 6. Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)

## 📬 Part II – Subject Access Request Templates

SARs target the *data controllers* who may hold your personal data (photos, registration details, correspondence).  
Cite **Article 15 UK GDPR** and include identifying details if needed.  

### 🧾 Template A – Pitch @ Palace Ltd / CIC (via liquidator)
```
Under Article 15 UK GDPR and s.45 Data Protection Act 2018 I request 
copies of all personal data relating to me (collected during Pitch @ Palace

Please state the lawful basis for processing and the current data retention status.
```

### 🏫 Template B – Host Universities
```
Please provide all personal data you hold from my attendance at the Pitch @ Palace 
event hosted at [university/date], including registration forms and photography consents.  
Identify any third-party recipients of that data.
```

### 💼 Template C – Corporate Sponsors

Please confirm whether Pitch @ Palace shared any attendee data with you. If so, provide 
the categories of data, the purpose of processing, and the retention period.

## 🧭 Recording and Mapping Responses

Create a simple spreadsheet:  

| Request ID | Date Sent | Target | Type (FOI/SAR) | Response Status | Exemptions Cited | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| 001 | 2025-11-03 | DBT | FOI | Pending | — | Initial contact email logged |  

Patterns in refusals (s.23 National Security, s.37 Royal Communications, s.40 Personal Data) can be visualised to map where institutional resistance clusters.  

---

## 🧩 Interpretation

A cluster of identical exemptions tells you something about governance culture.  
A delay tells you something about capacity or reluctance.  
A full release tells you something about distance from power.  

Transparency isn’t about winning information; it’s about measuring how power behaves when asked politely.
