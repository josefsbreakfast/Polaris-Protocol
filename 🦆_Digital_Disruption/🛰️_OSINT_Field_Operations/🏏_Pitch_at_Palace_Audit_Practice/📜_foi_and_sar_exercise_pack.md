# 📜 FOI + SAR Exercise Pack — Pitch @ Palace Audit Practice  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-01  
*Practical transparency exercises for examining prestige-linked public interfaces through lawful information requests.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

This node translates the Pitch @ Palace case into a **transparency exercise pack**.

It demonstrates how to request information **lawfully, politely, and persistently** using:
- the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), and  
- Subject Access Requests (SARs) under UK GDPR.

It does **not** assume wrongdoing.  
It assumes curiosity — and that democratic citizens are entitled to understand how prestige networks interact with public institutions.

---

## 🧩 Why This Matters  

Open-source investigation works best when it is lawful and boring.

FOIs and SARs are not weapons.  
They are instruments of **civic calibration**.

Every exemption, delay, or “information not held” response generates metadata.  
That metadata reveals where **institutional resistance**, sensitivity, or opacity tends to cluster.

---

## 🗂️ Part I — FOI Templates  

Each template can be adapted by date range or department.

Guidelines:
- keep tone neutral  
- cite FOIA 2000 explicitly  
- log every reference number  
- expect exemptions as data, not failure

## 🧭 Recording and Mapping Responses  

Maintain a simple tracking spreadsheet:

| Request ID | Date Sent | Target | Type | Status | Exemptions | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | 2025-11-03 | DBT | FOI | Pending | — | Reference logged |

Clusters of exemptions — for example:
- s.23 (National Security)  
- s.37 (Royal Communications)  
- s.40 (Personal Data)  

can be visualised to map **where resistance concentrates**.

---

## 🧩 Interpretation  

A refusal is not failure.  
A delay is not silence.

Patterns matter more than documents.

Transparency is less about “winning information”  
and more about observing **how power behaves when asked politely**.
