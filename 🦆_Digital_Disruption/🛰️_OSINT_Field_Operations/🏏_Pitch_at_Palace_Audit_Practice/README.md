OSINT field guide for auditing prestige-linked governance interfaces  

---

## 🧭 What This Folder Is

This directory contains a **complete OSINT audit practice** focused on *Pitch @ Palace* as a case study.

It is **not** an allegation file and **not** a campaign pack.

It is a **method library**: a way to examine how prestige, power, and governance interact when events, branding, and access replace formal accountability.

You can reuse this practice for:

* royal- or minister-adjacent initiatives
* prestige innovation platforms
* public–private convenings
* diplomacy-through-events
* any network where *access itself* is the commodity

The emphasis is on **lawful, boring, persistent transparency**.

---

## 🗺️ How to Use This Practice

Think of this folder as a **three-layer system**:

1. **Structural understanding** – what exists and how it is shaped
2. **Operational access** – how to lawfully observe and request information
3. **Pattern interpretation** – how to read responses as data

You do *not* need to read everything at once.
Different users will enter at different points.

## 🧱 Core Orientation Nodes (Start Here)

### 🧭 Overview — Pitch @ Palace Structure

**Purpose:** Structural map

Explains:

* what entities existed
* how they related to the Royal Household
* how the network expanded internationally
* where governance gaps appeared

Read this first to understand *what you are looking at* before touching FOIs.

---

### 🌍 Deregulation as Diplomatic Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Macro context

Places Pitch @ Palace inside:

* post-imperial governance patterns
* deregulation as a diplomatic tool
* prestige as a substitute for treaty or statute

This prevents misreading the case as an anomaly.
It is a **systemic pattern**, not a personality story.

---

## ⚖️ Compliance & Risk Lens

### ⚖️ Regulatory and Risk Framework — Pitch @ Palace

**Purpose:** Legal topology

Maps:

* AML and PEP exposure
* bribery-prevention logic
* sanctions and cross-border risk
* data-protection obligations

This node answers the question:

> *Why would regulators even care?*

It does not accuse.
It explains **why scrutiny is structurally justified**.

---

## 🎭 Prestige & Behaviour Analysis

### 🎭 Why It Attracts Bad Actors

**Purpose:** Behavioural gravity

Explains:

* reputation laundering
* aura-as-due-diligence failure
* why opportunists follow prestige networks

Use this to understand *who is drawn in* and *why*.

---

### 👑 Pitch Palace Outpicture Paths

**Purpose:** Influence mechanics

Analyses:

* guest lists as governance artefacts
* photography as portable legitimacy
* events as temporary diplomatic enclaves

This is where **images become infrastructure**.

---

### 🪞 Governance as Performance Art

**Purpose:** Cultural-psychological frame

Explains:

* accountability as theatre
* transparency as choreography
* humour and ritual as stabilisers

This helps explain why these systems persist *even when widely criticised*.

---

## 🛠️ Operational OSINT Toolkit

### 📜 FOI + SAR Exercise Pack

**Purpose:** Lawful access

Provides:

* FOI templates
* SAR templates
* recording methods

This is the **hands-on entry point** for practitioners.

---

### 🔍 How to Trace Event Data Flows

**Purpose:** Routing logic

Decision framework for:

* choosing FOI vs SAR
* identifying data controllers
* escalating refusals

Use this before sending requests to avoid dead ends.

---

### 🧩 Pattern Detection & Response Mapping

**Purpose:** Meaning extraction

Turns:

* refusals
* delays
* exemptions

into **behavioural data**.

This is where transparency becomes analysis, not frustration.

---

## 🏏 Civic Endurance & Culture Nodes

### 🏏 Test Cricket for Public Service

**Purpose:** Ethos

Reframes:

* patience as skill
* persistence as democratic practice

This keeps investigators from burning out.

---

### 📊 Cricket and Open-Source Investigation Theory

**Purpose:** Cultural literacy

Explains:

* scorekeeping
* pattern recognition
* collective analysis

Why slow oversight *works*.

---

## ☕ Humour, Ritual & Resilience

### ☕️ Tea, Toast, Transparency & Impunity

**Purpose:** Civic metabolism

Explores:

* humour as resilience
* ritual as coping mechanism
* when comfort becomes cover

Important for maintaining humanity without surrender.

---

### 🦚 The Peacock Principle

**Purpose:** Ceremonial distraction

Documents:

* pageantry as governance solvent
* costume change as accountability substitute

Pairs closely with *Governance as Performance Art*.

---

## 🧠 How These Nodes Fit Together

```
Structure → Access → Response → Pattern → Interpretation
   ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓            ↓
 Overview   FOI/SAR     Replies     Mapping     System Insight
```

This is an **audit spiral**, not a linear checklist.

You may loop back multiple times as new data appears.

---

## ⚠️ What This Practice Is Not

* Not a callout
* Not a takedown
* Not a rumour engine
* Not dependent on leaks

Everything here is:

* lawful
* document-based
* reproducible
* slow by design

---

## 🧭 Who This Is For

* OSINT practitioners
* journalists
* researchers
* students
* civil servants
* citizens learning transparency tools

You do **not** need insider access.
Curiosity is sufficient.  

---

🏮 Closing Note

Prestige systems rely on being unexamined, not unseen.

This audit practice shows how to look — patiently, lawfully, and without spectacle.

If you can follow a guest list, you can follow power.
