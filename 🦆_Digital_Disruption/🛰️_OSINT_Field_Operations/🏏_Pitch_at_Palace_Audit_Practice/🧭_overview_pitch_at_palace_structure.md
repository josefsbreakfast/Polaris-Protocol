# 🧭 Overview — Pitch @ Palace Structure  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-01  
*How a prestige platform operated as a private structure with public aura and minimal oversight.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

Pitch @ Palace was introduced as a bridge between monarchy, entrepreneurship, and diplomacy.  
It projected modernisation without altering the underlying architecture of privilege.

Between 2014 and 2019 it operated as a **small private company with a very large aura**:  
a privately governed structure consistently presented as a public-facing service.

This node sketches what actually existed —  
how it was built, how it moved, and where the governance air-gaps appeared.

It is not a dossier of wrongdoing.  
It is a **diagram of exemption**: how prestige temporarily displaces ordinary oversight.

## 🏛️ Formation  

Pitch @ Palace Ltd was incorporated in 2014 as a private company limited by shares.  
A second entity, Pitch @ Palace CIC, was formed in 2018 to introduce a community-interest framing.

Both entities were dissolved quietly between 2022 and 2023.

Events were staged inside royal venues, but the Royal Household was never the legal controller.  
The stage and the structure were separate.

That separation is the first fault line.

## 🤝 Network  

Domestically, the platform linked:
- UK government departments (UKTI → DIT → DBT)  
- universities  
- major corporate sponsors  

Internationally, it replicated itself as **Pitch @ Palace Global**, with chapters in:
- the Gulf  
- Asia  
- Australia  
- Latin America  

Most overseas iterations relied on short memoranda rather than statute or treaty.

Each event brought diplomats, investors, and start-ups into the same photo frame.  
The brand carried the legitimacy of the Palace —  
without inheriting any of its accountability structures.

## 💼 Operations  

The visible function was a pitch event.  
The latent function was a **convening network**.

- Introductions and patronage  
- Soft diplomatic signalling  
- Sponsor access and brand association  

Revenue flowed through sponsorship and in-kind support.  
Data flowed through registration lists, imagery, and correspondence.  
Governance flowed through **no independent audit mechanism at all**.

Prestige behaved like a solvent:  
it dissolved questions faster than they could be asked.

---

## ⚖️ Governance Gaps  

- **Accountability void**  
  Neither public body nor charity → no FOI obligation, no full public accounts.

- **AML and PEP exposure**  
  Royal branding combined with international capital creates elevated laundering risk.

- **Data-protection grey zone**  
  Overlapping controllers complicate ICO jurisdiction and responsibility.

- **Foreign-policy blur**  
  Diplomatic signalling without FCDO supervision or mandate.

- **Dissolution opacity**  
  Entities wound down quietly; data fate and retention unclear.

Each gap is a door that never quite shuts —  
inviting the same category of opportunist to try the handle.

## 🧩 Interpretation  

Pitch @ Palace demonstrates how a state can build an **interface instead of an institution**.

Prestige replaces governance.  
Access replaces accountability.

This is the domestic expression of the same pattern traced in  
**🌍 Deregulation as Diplomatic Infrastructure** —  
where deregulation becomes a diplomatic language  
and aura becomes policy.
