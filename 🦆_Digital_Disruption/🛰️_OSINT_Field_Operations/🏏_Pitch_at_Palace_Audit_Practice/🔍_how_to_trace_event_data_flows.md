*A Decision Tree for SAR and FOI Navigation*

## 🧭 Orientation

Every event — from a university dinner to a royal innovation summit — generates data.  
Guest lists, access logs, contracts, sponsorships, photographs, and internal communications all form part of the invisible record.  

This node outlines how to trace those records using **Subject Access Requests (SARs)** and **Freedom of Information (FOI)** routes.  
Think of it as civic forensics — a map for reconstructing what power looked like, where it met, and how it moved.  

---

## 🧩 Step One: Define the Event as Data System

List every entity that may have held, transmitted, or processed related data:  

- **Host Institution** (university, department, royal household)  
- **Venue Operator** (security, visitor logs, CCTV)  
- **Sponsors / Partners** (contracts, press materials)  
- **Government Departments** (if public funds or ministers involved)  
- **Media / PR Agencies** (photography, attendee releases)  

Each constitutes a node in the data network.

## ⚖️ Step Two: Choose the Right Access Mechanism

| Data Holder | Route | Legal Basis | Caveats |
|--------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Public body** | FOI Request | Freedom of Information Act 2000 | Exemptions for personal data, commercial interests, “national security” |
| **Private company processing your data** | SAR | UK GDPR Article 15 | May reject for disproportionate effort; can request ID verification |
| **Hybrid entity (university spin-out / charity)** | SAR + FOI | Dual-layer approach | Data may be split across regimes |
| **Regulatory or royal entities** | Limited / no FOI | Constitutional exemptions | May require press or parliamentary route |

## 🧠 Step Three: The Decision Tree

```
Start
 ↓
Do you appear in the event record?
 ├─ Yes → File a SAR with the host and any processors.
 │          Include timestamps, dates, and photo evidence.
 └─ No → Proceed via FOI for contextual or aggregate data.
              Specify contracts, budgets, or partnership details.
 ↓
Were third-party processors used?
 ├─ Yes → Send follow-up SARs citing Article 26 (Joint Controllers).
 └─ No → Request confirmation of internal record deletion schedule.
 ↓
Did the event involve public funding?
 ├─ Yes → FOI to funding department + SAR to event operator.
 └─ No → Contractual access only; consider ICO complaint if refused.
 ↓
Map responses by metadata overlap.
 → Build timeline from internal references, even if redacted.
```

## 🪞 Step Four: Reading Between the Redactions

Redactions are not absences — they are *metadata events*.  
They mark what the institution considers sensitive.  
Track recurring blackouts across multiple responses; patterns reveal what story the data won’t tell.  

> “The rhythm of redaction often hums louder than the text itself.”  

---

## 🪶 Step Five: Triangulate Through Time

1. Compare timestamps across different respondents’ replies.  
2. Note identical phrasing — it suggests coordinated response drafting.  
3. Watch for **date clustering** — multiple refusals within 24 hours may signal internal guidance.  
4. Refile after 6–8 weeks under updated context; it often dislodges delayed data.  

---

## 🧩 Step Six: Escalation Pathways

- **ICO Complaint:** if no response within statutory period or clear mishandling.  
- **Small-Claims Court:** for unlawful data withholding or proven damage.  
- **Press / Academic Publication:** if findings serve public interest or research.  

The key is documentation density — every unanswered email is an evidence node.

## 🧭 Closing Reflection

Tracing event data is not about scandal; it’s about structure.  
To follow the flow of a single guest list is to glimpse how soft power, administration, and narrative intertwine.  

What we call “transparency” is often just a better-lit maze — but with a map, even a maze reveals its logic.
