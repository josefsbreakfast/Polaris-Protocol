# 🧩 Pattern Detection & Response Mapping — Pitch @ Palace Transparency Data  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-01  
*How refusals, delays, and exemptions become behavioural data about governance.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

Freedom of Information and data-access requests generate more than documents.  
They generate **behavioural traces**.

Every acknowledgement, delay, exemption, or refusal is a data point revealing how institutions metabolise curiosity.

This node translates those traces into readable patterns:  
bureaucratic friction treated as **metadata of power**.

It builds directly on:
- **📜 FOI + SAR Exercise Pack**, and  
- **🔍 How to Trace Event Data Flows**,  

turning procedural noise into civic signal.

---

## 🧮 How to Read a Refusal  

### 1. Speed  
How quickly is the request acknowledged?

- **Fast** → well-rehearsed topic or standard workflow  
- **Slow** → capacity strain, sensitivity, or internal escalation  

Latency is itself a disclosure.

---

### 2. Exemption Type  
Each section code signals a different boundary:

- **s.23** — National Security Bodies  
  *Often indicates intelligence-adjacent sensitivity.*

- **s.24** — National Security Interest  
  *A softer political shield; frequently paired with delay.*

- **s.37** — Royal Communications  
  *Marks constitutional insulation.*

- **s.40** — Personal Data  
  *Legitimate protection, overseen by the ICO.*

- **s.43** — Commercial Interests  
  *Commonly used to stall or partial-release.*

Exemptions are not excuses; they are **labels on pressure points**.

---

### 3. Tone  
Is the response:
- formulaic and templated, or  
- personal and locally drafted?

Repetition suggests central guidance.  
Variation suggests improvisation.

---

### 4. Format  
Inspect the artefact itself:
- PDF metadata  
- redaction layers  
- file-naming conventions  

These are forensic breadcrumbs of internal workflow.

## 🧭 Mapping Method  

Create a simple matrix, treating each request as a row and each behavioural feature as a column.

| Request ID | Target Body | Days to Acknowledge | Exemption(s) | Tone | File Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | DBT | 3 | s.37 | Template | PDF | Royal communications invoked |
| 002 | ICO | 1 | s.40 | Personalised | DOCX | Standard privacy redaction |

From this dataset, generate:

- **Heatmaps** — exemption frequency by body  
- **Timelines** — acknowledgement and response speed  
- **Phrase maps** — recurring language (“not held”, “disproportionate effort”)

Visualisation converts repetition into insight.

## 🧩 Interpreting Clusters  

- **Royal Exemption Clusters (s.37)**  
  → define the boundary of constitutional sensitivity.

- **Commercial Clusters (s.43)**  
  → reveal where private interest interfaces with public function.

- **Mixed Security Codes (s.23 + s.24)**  
  → suggest narrative borrowing to justify opacity.

- **Persistent Delay Patterns**  
  → indicate under-resourcing, risk aversion, or coordinated stalling.

A map of refusals is still a map.

---

## 🧠 Interpretation Layer  

Think of each FOI cycle as a Test match.

Each over of correspondence produces metrics:
- response time  
- scope narrowing  
- exemption drift  

Plotted longitudinally, these form a **governance batting average**.

Patience is not passivity.  
It is the investigator’s most ethical instrument.

*🧩 Pattern Detection & Response Mapping — Pitch @ Palace Transparency Data* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how information-access responses can be analysed as behavioural data, revealing institutional reflexes through patterns of delay, refusal, and exemption.
