*How to look clearly without becoming the thing you study.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
*OSINT Field Operations* sets the ethics and methodology for open-source investigation under the Polaris Protocol.  
It’s for those who map patterns of suppression, information war, or civic erosion — and need to stay human while doing it.

The rule: **transparency without voyeurism, verification without extraction**.

---

## 🧩 Field Methods  
- **Pattern Tracking** — document recurrence, not individuals.  
- **Ethical Verification** — double-source, never dox, protect the unwilling witness.  
- **Containment Literacy** — recognise manipulation without feeding it.  
- **Archival Integrity** — record metadata faithfully; resist spectacle metrics.  

OSINT here is civic duty, not theatre.  
Our role is *diagnostic*, not punitive.
