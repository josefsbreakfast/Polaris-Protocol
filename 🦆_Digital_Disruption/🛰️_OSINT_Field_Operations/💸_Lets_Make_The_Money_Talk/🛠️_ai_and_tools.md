# 🤖 AI and Tools

**First created:** 2025-12-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-21  
*Using technology to support accountability without outsourcing judgement.*

---

## Purpose

This node defines how AI systems and analytical tools may be used within  
**🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations / 💸 Let’s Make the Money Talk**.

Technology here is a support mechanism.
It is not an arbiter of truth, ethics, or intent.

---

## AI as Administrative Support

AI systems may be used for:
- drafting FOI and SAR requests,
- summarising public documents,
- formatting and organising material,
- managing timelines and task lists,
- and supporting basic data handling.

These uses reduce cognitive load without replacing judgement.

---

## Prohibited Uses

AI systems must not be used to:
- interpret survivor testimony,
- assess credibility,
- infer intent or guilt,
- generate moral conclusions,
- or substitute for legal analysis.

Decisions affecting scope, tone, or escalation remain human responsibilities.

---

## Dual-Use Awareness

Tools designed for beneficial purposes may also be misused.

Examples include:
- sentiment analysis repurposed for suppression,
- behavioural modelling used for manipulation,
- content moderation logic used to erase accountability signals.

Dual-use risk requires:
- conservative deployment,
- explicit boundaries,
- and ongoing review.

Capability does not justify application.

---

## Avoiding Euphemism Drift

AI systems trained on polluted discourse may:
- soften descriptions of harm,
- normalise minimisation,
- or reproduce institutional framing.

Users should:
- correct euphemism when encountered,
- restate harm accurately,
- and preserve clear language in outputs.

Clarity is a safeguard.

---

## Training Data and Harm

This project does not:
- train models on abuse archives,
- upload sensitive material,
- or treat trauma as raw data.

Using harm as training input risks:
- desensitisation,
- distortion,
- and secondary harm.

Absence of training is a protective choice.

---

## Analytical Tools Beyond AI

Non-AI tools are often preferable.

These include:
- spreadsheets,
- document databases,
- visual mapping software,
- and version-controlled archives.

Simplicity improves auditability.

---

## Transparency of Method

Use of tools should be:
- documented,
- reproducible,
- and explainable to non-specialists.

Opacity in method undermines legitimacy.
This applies equally to technical and legal work.

---

## Human Judgement Retained

Interpretation, prioritisation, and escalation:
- require context,
- ethical reasoning,
- and accountability.

These cannot be delegated to systems optimised for pattern detection.

Human judgement is slower.
That is a feature.

---

## Closing

Technology can assist accountability.
It cannot replace responsibility.

Tools should make justice easier to pursue — not easier to evade.

---

## 🏮 Footer  

*Let’s Make the Money Talk* is an operational folder within **🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations**.  
It documents lawful, survivor-aligned approaches to tracing how money, process, and power are used to obstruct accountability — and how transparency can be used to reduce that capacity for harm.

This work:
- prioritises survivor sovereignty,
- rejects speculation and violence,
- and treats transparency as a democratic right, not a privilege.

Accountability is not revenge.  
Process is not theatre.  
And justice does not require silence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
