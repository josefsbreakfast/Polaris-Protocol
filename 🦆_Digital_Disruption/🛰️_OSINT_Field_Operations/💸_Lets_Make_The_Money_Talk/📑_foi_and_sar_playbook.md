# 📑 FOI and SAR Playbook

**First created:** 2025-12-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-21  
*Using transparency law as lawful, cumulative accountability pressure.*

---

## Purpose

This node sets out how Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and Subject Access Requests (SARs) are used within  
**🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations / 💸 Let’s Make the Money Talk**.

FOI and SAR are not used here to “uncover secrets”.  
They are used to:
- test governance,
- document compliance behaviour,
- and create formal accountability records.

---

## FOI and SAR as Audit Tools

FOI and SAR requests are audit instruments.

Their function is to:
- confirm whether records exist,
- assess record-keeping quality,
- evaluate decision-making processes,
- and observe institutional response under scrutiny.

A poor response is not failure.  
It is **data**.

---

## Precision Over Volume

Requests must be:
- narrowly scoped,
- time-bounded,
- and procedurally clear.

Flooding requests:
- weakens legitimacy,
- invites dismissal,
- and burdens regulators.

Precision:
- reduces refusal grounds,
- strengthens appeals,
- and builds cumulative pressure.

One good request is worth more than ten vague ones.

---

## What to Ask For

Effective requests focus on:
- policies and procedures,
- contracts and procurement,
- risk assessments,
- safeguarding protocols,
- escalation and reporting pathways,
- use of external advisors,
- and compliance reviews.

Requests should ask **how decisions were made**, not why.

---

## Expectation Management

Participants should expect:
- delay,
- partial disclosure,
- heavy redaction,
- exemption claims,
- or dismissive tone.

These responses are common.  
They are not personal.

Each response reveals:
- institutional posture,
- legal literacy,
- and tolerance for scrutiny.

---

## Tone and Conduct

All correspondence must remain:
- calm,
- procedural,
- and factual.

Demeaning or hostile replies should be:
- documented,
- not escalated emotionally,
- and not mirrored.

Professionalism protects the request and the requester.

---

## Internal Review and Appeal

Where responses are inadequate:
- request internal review promptly,
- cite statutory duties,
- reference procedural failure rather than motive.

Escalation should be:
- methodical,
- documented,
- and proportionate.

Persistence matters more than confrontation.

---

## Regulator Escalation

Regulators act on **patterns**, not single complaints.

Escalation is appropriate when:
- deadlines are routinely missed,
- searches are demonstrably inadequate,
- exemptions are inconsistently applied,
- or records appear systematically absent.

Regulatory pressure strengthens the law itself.

---

## Documenting Governance Failure

Maintain records of:
- request wording,
- response timelines,
- exemption claims,
- redaction patterns,
- and review outcomes.

This creates an external accountability archive independent of any single institution.

---

## FOI and SAR as Collective Action

FOI and SAR work scales through:
- coordination of themes,
- division of labour,
- and shared standards.

It does not require:
- anonymity,
- heroics,
- or mass participation.

Consistency is more effective than volume.

---

## Emotional Resilience

FOI and SAR work can attract:
- condescension,
- dismissal,
- or subtle intimidation.

These responses often indicate:
- discomfort with scrutiny,
- rather than weakness of the request.

Participants should:
- pace themselves,
- share workload,
- and step back when needed.

Endurance is a form of power.

---

## Closing

FOI and SAR do not force truth.  
They force **process**.

When process fails under scrutiny, accountability follows — slowly, lawfully, and visibly.

---

## 🏮 Footer  

*Let’s Make the Money Talk* is an operational folder within **🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations**.  
It documents lawful, survivor-aligned approaches to tracing how money, process, and power are used to obstruct accountability — and how transparency can be used to reduce that capacity for harm.

This work:
- prioritises survivor sovereignty,
- rejects speculation and violence,
- and treats transparency as a democratic right, not a privilege.

Accountability is not revenge.  
Process is not theatre.  
And justice does not require silence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
