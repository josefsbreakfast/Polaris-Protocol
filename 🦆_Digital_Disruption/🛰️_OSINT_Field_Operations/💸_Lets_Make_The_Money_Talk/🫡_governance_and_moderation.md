# 🫡 Governance and Moderation

**First created:** 2025-12-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-21  
*Maintaining legitimacy, safety, and coherence through clear rules and restraint.*

---

## Purpose

This node defines how participation, decision-making, and moderation operate within  
**🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations / 💸 Let’s Make the Money Talk**.

Governance exists to:
- protect survivors,
- preserve legality,
- prevent capture or escalation,
- and keep the work usable over time.

Moderation is a function of care, not control.

---

## Scope of Authority

Governance applies to:
- shared documents and repositories,
- public-facing outputs,
- coordination spaces,
- and named initiatives under this folder.

It does not claim authority over:
- private discussion,
- personal research,
- or independent commentary.

Boundaries are explicit to avoid overreach.

---

## Decision-Making Principles

Decisions are guided by:
- written principles,
- survivor sovereignty,
- lawful process,
- and harm reduction.

Where uncertainty exists, the default is:
- narrower scope,
- slower action,
- and higher restraint.

Irreversible actions require consensus or documented review.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

Participation is role-based, not status-based.

Roles may include:
- document authorship,
- review and editing,
- legal or compliance input,
- data organisation,
- or moderation support.

Roles are:
- voluntary,
- time-limited,
- and revocable without penalty.

No role conveys personal authority.

---

## Moderation Objectives

Moderation exists to:
- prevent harassment,
- interrupt speculation,
- slow escalation,
- and protect vulnerable participants.

It does not exist to:
- enforce ideological alignment,
- suppress disagreement,
- or manage reputation.

Moderation decisions are procedural, not personal.

---

## Prohibited Conduct

The following are not permitted within this work:
- naming or targeting private individuals,
- speculation about guilt or intent,
- harassment, threats, or intimidation,
- calls for violence or punishment,
- doxxing or data misuse,
- or pressure on survivors to engage.

Violations result in removal of content and, if necessary, exclusion from participation.

---

## Handling Disagreement

Disagreement is expected and healthy.

It becomes a governance issue when:
- it escalates publicly,
- it personalises critique,
- or it pressures survivors.

Resolution prioritises:
- documentation,
- time,
- and process.

Silencing disagreement creates risk.
Escalating it creates harm.

---

## Transparency of Moderation

Moderation actions should be:
- logged,
- explained briefly,
- and tied to written principles.

Opacity breeds mistrust.
Over-explanation fuels conflict.

Clarity is sufficient.

---

## External Pressure and Infiltration

This work assumes:
- misrepresentation,
- hostile framing,
- and opportunistic engagement.

Responses to pressure are:
- procedural,
- minimal,
- and non-reactive.

No attempt is made to debate bad-faith actors.

Engagement is selective by design.

---

## Survivor Protection Measures

When survivor risk increases:
- scope tightens,
- visibility reduces,
- and moderation thresholds rise.

Survivor safety overrides:
- openness,
- participation,
- and momentum.

This is non-negotiable.

---

## Exit, Removal, and Return

Participants may:
- step back,
- disengage,
- or return later without explanation.

Removal for boundary violations is:
- procedural,
- documented,
- and final for the relevant context.

Re-entry is not automatic.

---

## Closing

Governance is not a brake on accountability.
It is what allows accountability to endure.

Moderation preserves the conditions under which justice remains possible.

---

## 🏮 Footer  

*Let’s Make the Money Talk* is an operational folder within **🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations**.  
It documents lawful, survivor-aligned approaches to tracing how money, process, and power are used to obstruct accountability — and how transparency can be used to reduce that capacity for harm.

This work:
- prioritises survivor sovereignty,
- rejects speculation and violence,
- and treats transparency as a democratic right, not a privilege.

Accountability is not revenge.  
Process is not theatre.  
And justice does not require silence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
