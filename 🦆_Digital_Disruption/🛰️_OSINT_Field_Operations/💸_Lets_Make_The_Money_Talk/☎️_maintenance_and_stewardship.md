# ☎️ Maintenance and Stewardship

**First created:** 2025-12-21 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-21  
*Keeping the work usable, ethical, and intact over time.*

## Purpose

This node defines how  
**🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations / 💸 Let’s Make the Money Talk**  
is maintained, stewarded, and handed forward.

Stewardship is not ownership.
It is custodial responsibility for:
- integrity,
- safety,
- and continuity.

---

## Stewardship Over Control

No individual or group “owns” this work.

Stewardship means:
- preserving intent,
- protecting boundaries,
- and enabling future use without distortion.

Control invites capture.
Stewardship resists it.

---

## Versioning and Change Discipline

Changes should be:
- documented,
- dated,
- and reversible.

Major changes require:
- explanation of rationale,
- confirmation of principle alignment,
- and review for survivor impact.

Silently rewriting history undermines trust.

---

## Scope Drift Management

Over time, pressure may arise to:
- broaden scope,
- personalise analysis,
- or chase emerging controversies.

Scope drift is managed by:
- returning to Principles,
- re-reading the Risk Register,
- and narrowing rather than expanding.

Expansion is a decision, not an accident.

---

## Handover and Succession

This work should remain usable if:
- contributors step back,
- maintainers change,
- or public attention fades.

Good handover includes:
- clear file structure,
- readable documentation,
- and minimal reliance on tacit knowledge.

Continuity is a design goal.

---

## Pausing and Dormancy

Periods of inactivity are acceptable.

Dormancy is not failure.
It may reflect:
- safety needs,
- capacity limits,
- or strategic patience.

Restarting after dormancy should include:
- re-reading principles,
- reassessing risk,
- and re-confirming survivor constraints.

---

## Responding to External Change

Legal, political, or technological shifts may alter conditions.

Responses should be:
- cautious,
- documented,
- and proportional.

Do not retrofit the work to suit new narratives.
Adjust method, not purpose.

---

## Care for Participants

Stewardship includes care for those involved.

This means:
- normalising exit,
- discouraging over-identification,
- and valuing sustainability over heroics.

People are not infrastructure.

---

## Archival Integrity

Documents should remain:
- accessible,
- legible,
- and minimally dependent on platforms.

Where possible:
- maintain offline copies,
- avoid link rot,
- and prefer stable formats.

Archives are future-facing.

---

## Ethical Decommissioning

If the work must end, decommissioning should:
- protect survivors,
- prevent misuse,
- and preserve records responsibly.

Ending well matters as much as beginning well.

---

## Closing

Accountability work is not a sprint or a campaign.
It is custodial.

Stewardship ensures that:
- pressure remains lawful,
- memory remains intact,
- and justice remains possible.

---

## 🏮 Footer  

*Let’s Make the Money Talk* is an operational folder within **🦆 Digital_Disruption / 🛰️ OSINT_Field_Operations**.  
It documents lawful, survivor-aligned approaches to tracing how money, process, and power are used to obstruct accountability — and how transparency can be used to reduce that capacity for harm.

This work:
- prioritises survivor sovereignty,
- rejects speculation and violence,
- and treats transparency as a democratic right, not a privilege.

Accountability is not revenge.  
Process is not theatre.  
And justice does not require silence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
