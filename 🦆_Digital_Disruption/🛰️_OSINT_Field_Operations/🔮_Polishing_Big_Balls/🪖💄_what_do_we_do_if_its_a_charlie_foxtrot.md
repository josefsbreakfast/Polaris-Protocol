# 🪖💄 What Do We Do If It’s a Charlie Foxtrot  
**First created:** 2026-01-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*A calm map of options when governance is genuinely broken.*

---

Most checks end quietly.  
Some end reassuringly.  
A small number reveal something that is not just messy, but **structurally unsound**.

This node exists for that last case.

It is not a call to action.  
It is not a ladder you are expected to climb.  
It is a **menu of options**, ordered from least intense to most public, with explicit permission to choose none of them.

---

## First: a reality check (important)

Before doing anything else, ask:

- Is anyone in immediate danger?  
- Is there evidence of active harm, not just poor process?  

In most cases, the answer is **no**.

A Charlie Foxtrot here usually means:
- chronic governance failure  
- misleading assurances  
- missing or retrofitted safeguards  
- hostile or inappropriate handling of lawful requests  

These are serious — but they are rarely emergencies.

Slow is still correct.

## What qualifies as “Charlie Foxtrot” territory

This file is relevant if you see **patterns**, not one-offs:

- no DPIA where one should exist  
- DPIAs dated after deployment with no explanation  
- repeated contradictions across departments or vendors  
- evidence of profiling or inference denied on paper but present in practice  
- requests met with belittling, bullying, or intimidatory tone  
- responsibility passed in circles with no owner  

One red flag is noise.  
Several, consistently, is structure.

---

## Option 1: Clarify and document (often enough)

Sometimes the most effective step is simply:
- restating the issue clearly  
- asking for confirmation in writing  
- requesting correction of the record  

This:
- creates an internal paper trail  
- gives institutions a chance to fix things quietly  
- often resolves more than expected  

If this works, you can stop here.

---

## Option 2: Use internal accountability routes

Public bodies usually have:
- a Data Protection Officer  
- an information governance lead  
- a complaints or assurance function  

A short, factual summary pointing to:
- missing documents  
- contradictory statements  
- governance gaps  

can be enough to trigger internal review.

You are not obliged to argue the case.  
Pointing to the paperwork is sufficient.

---

## Option 3: External regulators (still boring)

If internal routes stall or fail, regulatory options exist.

Depending on context, this may include:
- the Information Commissioner’s Office  
- an Ombudsman  
- a sector-specific regulator  

These bodies are:
- slow  
- process-driven  
- not dramatic  

That is a feature, not a bug.

They are most effective when you can show:
- you tried proportionate steps first  
- the issue is systemic  
- the concern is about governance, not grievance  

---

## Option 4: Political routes (representative, not theatrical)

In some cases, it is appropriate to:
- write to an MP or elected representative  
- contact a relevant parliamentary committee  

This is most effective when framed as:
> “This is a governance gap that affects public trust.”

rather than:
> “Something terrible happened to me.”

You are asking for oversight, not rescue.

---

## Option 5: Media or civil society (optional, not default)

Public routes exist:
- journalists  
- advocacy organisations  
- publishing your own analysis  

These routes:
- increase visibility  
- reduce institutional ability to ignore issues  
- also increase personal load  

They are **not required** for legitimacy.

Choosing not to go public is not failure.

---

## What you do *not* owe the situation

You do not owe:
- persistence beyond your capacity  
- emotional labour  
- exposure  
- becoming “the person who fixes this”  

You are allowed to:
- pause  
- hand off  
- archive the work  
- decide this is not yours to carry  

That decision does not invalidate what you’ve found.

---

## A grounding rule of thumb

Escalate because:
- the **paper trail is broken**,  
not because:
- you are angry, frightened, or exhausted.

If you are emotionally activated, stop first.

The work will still be there tomorrow.

*What Do We Do If It’s a Charlie Foxtrot* is a contingency node within **🔮 Polishing Big Balls**.  
It exists to make escalation legible without making it compulsory.

Most scrutiny should end long before this file is needed.  
When it doesn’t, calm options still exist.

You are not required to save the system.  
You are only required to decide — proportionately — what you will do next.
