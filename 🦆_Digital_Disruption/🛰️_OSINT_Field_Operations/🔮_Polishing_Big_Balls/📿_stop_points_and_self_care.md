# 📿 Stop Points & Self-Care  
**First created:** 2026-01-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*When to pause, hand off, or close the folder — without losing the thread.*

---

This work is finite.  
It is meant to be picked up, put down, and sometimes left alone.

This node exists to name **natural stopping points**, and to give explicit permission to step back — not as failure, but as good process hygiene.

---

## Why stop points matter

Checking governance, reading paperwork, and noticing system behaviour can quietly tax you.

Not because the work is dramatic, but because:
- ambiguity accumulates  
- friction wears down attention  
- systems sometimes respond oddly  
- your nervous system notices before your intellect does  

Stopping is part of staying accurate.

---

## Signs it’s time to pause

You might consider pausing if:
- you’re re-reading the same documents without learning anything new  
- emails or responses are looping without progress  
- you feel pressure to “just push a bit harder” without a clear next step  
- your body is tense, tired, or jumpy  
- curiosity has tipped into vigilance  

These are not moral signals.  
They are physiological and cognitive ones.

---

## Legitimate pause points (use freely)

It is reasonable to pause when:
- you’ve identified the relevant service and governance shape  
- you’ve received a clear answer — compliant or not  
- further requests would repeat earlier ones  
- the remaining uncertainty is marginal  
- the cost of continuing outweighs the value of clarity  

You do not need resolution on every point.

---

## Handing off (also valid)

Sometimes the right move is not to continue personally.

Handing off can mean:
- sharing notes with someone else  
- pointing a journalist, advocate, or expert to the paper trail  
- flagging an issue internally and stepping back  
- archiving the folder and returning later  

Hand-off is not abandonment.  
It is load-balancing.

---

## Closing the folder on purpose

Actively closing the folder is different from burning out.

Closing looks like:
- labelling the work “complete for now”  
- saving materials in one place  
- writing a one-line summary for future you  
- deciding not to check again unless something changes  

This creates psychological containment.

---

## Why this is part of good governance work

Institutions rely on:
- fatigue  
- confusion  
- emotional overload  

Healthy scrutiny relies on:
- proportion  
- rest  
- perspective  

Self-care here is not indulgence.  
It is accuracy maintenance.

---

## A grounding reminder

You are not required to:
- resolve systemic problems alone  
- carry the emotional weight of institutional design  
- remain available to a system indefinitely  

Your role is to observe, understand, and decide — not to endure.

*📿 Stop Points & Self-Care* is a boundary-setting node within **🔮 Polishing Big Balls**.  
It exists to ensure that clarity does not come at the cost of wellbeing.

Good systems tolerate pauses.  
Good inquiry includes rest.

You are allowed to stop — and still have done enough.
