Fatigue changes language.

When you’re tired, frustrated, or overloaded, it’s easy to slip into phrasing that:
- escalates unintentionally  
- invites defensiveness  
- shifts focus away from the actual request  

This note exists to help you notice that moment — and pause.

## Common tired-language traps

- “You are refusing to…”  
- “Why haven’t you…”  
- “This is unacceptable…”  
- “Clearly you are failing to…”  
- “I demand…”  
- “You must explain…”  
- “I will escalate unless…”

These phrases:
- may be accurate in sentiment  
- but tend to narrow responses  
- and increase institutional self-protection  

They cost energy without adding clarity.

## What to do instead

If you notice tired language creeping in:
- save the draft  
- step away  
- return later  
- rewrite in the morning  

Nothing here requires speed.
