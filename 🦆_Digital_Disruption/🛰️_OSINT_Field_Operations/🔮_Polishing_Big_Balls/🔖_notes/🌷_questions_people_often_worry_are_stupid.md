*They aren’t. They’re usually the right ones.*

People often hesitate before asking simple questions.

Not because the questions are unsophisticated —  
but because systems project confidence and complexity.

This note exists to say: the questions below are normal.

---

## Common questions (all reasonable)

- “Who is actually responsible for this service?”  
- “Is there a DPIA for this specific use?”  
- “Was the DPIA done before deployment?”  
- “What data about me is inferred rather than collected?”  
- “Is this advisory, or does it affect decisions?”  
- “Which organisation decides how this is used?”  
- “What is explicitly out of scope?”

If a system cannot answer these calmly, that is not on you.

---

## Why these questions matter

These questions:
- locate responsibility  
- clarify scope  
- test governance maturity  
- reduce fear through specificity  

They are not accusations.  
They are orientation tools.

---

## A quiet reassurance

If you’re worried a question sounds naïve, it usually means:
- the system benefits from not being asked  
- or others have learned not to ask  

Neither is a reason to stay silent.

*🌷 Questions People Often Worry Are “Stupid”* is a reassurance note within **🔮 Polishing Big Balls**.  
It exists to normalise curiosity and reduce self-censorship when dealing with confident systems.

If a question feels basic, it’s probably structural.  
Structural questions are rarely stupid.
