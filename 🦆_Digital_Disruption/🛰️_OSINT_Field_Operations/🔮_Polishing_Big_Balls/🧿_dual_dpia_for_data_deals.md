# 03 · Dual DPIA the Data Deals (Government Contracting Edition)  
**First created:** 2026-01-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*A calm method for checking whether public-sector data contracts are governed as claimed.*

---

This node sets out a **specific, repeatable method** for examining data services delivered under government contracts, using parallel and lawful requests.

It is written for situations where:
- a public authority uses a private supplier  
- personal data is processed  
- analytics, profiling, or inference are involved  
- responses feel narrow, dismissive, or oddly defensive  

The tone here is neutral by design.  
You are not assuming failure.  
You are checking whether the safeguards that should exist actually do.

## What “Dual DPIA” means in government contexts

In public-sector contracting, responsibility is often split across layers:
- the **public authority** (usually the data controller)
- one or more **private suppliers** (processors or joint controllers)

A *Dual DPIA* approach means:
- asking the **controller** for governance and risk documents  
- asking the **processor** what they supplied or hold  
- and comparing both against lived reality (via SARs, where applicable)

You are not duplicating effort.  
You are cross-validating roles.

---

## Why government contractors often narrow responses

It is common for contractors — and sometimes authorities — to:
- interpret requests as narrowly as possible  
- answer only the literal wording, not the intent  
- exclude inferred or derived data unless explicitly named  
- redirect responsibility sideways  

This behaviour is usually:
- risk-averse  
- legally coached  
- process-driven  

It does not automatically indicate wrongdoing.  
It *does* mean clarity matters.

---

## What should normally be disclosable

Without getting technical, the following are **reasonable to expect**, subject to lawful exemptions:

### From the public authority (FOI)
- confirmation whether a DPIA exists  
- copies of DPIAs or equivalent risk assessments  
- dates, authors, and scope descriptions  
- procurement documents referencing data protection  
- high-level risk registers or assurance summaries  

Even where content is partially withheld, **existence and metadata** are usually disclosable.

---

### From either party (SAR, if you are in scope)
- personal data held about you  
- inferred, derived, or predicted attributes  
- profiles, flags, or risk indicators  
- metadata relating to decision-making or sharing  

You are allowed to name these categories explicitly.

---

## A practical heads-up on wording

Vague requests tend to be answered vaguely.

Helpful phrasing includes:
- “including inferred or derived data”  
- “including profiling or segmentation labels”  
- “including any DPIAs or equivalent documents”  
- “including documents created before or after deployment”  

This is not aggressive drafting.  
It is simply specific.

---

## When responses feel belittling or dismissive

Occasionally, responses may:
- minimise your question  
- suggest misunderstanding on your part  
- imply the request is unnecessary  
- adopt a lecturing or patronising tone  

This is not a signal to escalate immediately.

Often, it reflects:
- internal discomfort  
- unfamiliarity with being asked  
- poorly scripted templates  

The most effective response is usually:
> calm clarification, restating the request, narrowing scope if needed.

Tone mismatches are data, but not emergencies.

---

## When responses cross a line

Very rarely, responses may feel:
- hostile  
- bullying  
- threatening  
- or personally directed  

If this happens:
- pause  
- save the correspondence  
- do not reply while emotionally activated  

You are entitled to:
- professional communication  
- proportionate handling  
- responses free from intimidation  

You do not need to justify your interest.

This folder contains later guidance on options **if** behaviour becomes genuinely inappropriate. You do not need to jump ahead.

---

## How to compare what you receive

Once you have responses:
- place them side by side  
- note differences in scope, timing, and description  
- look for what is missing rather than what is said  

You are looking for:
- consistency  
- clarity  
- alignment between promise and practice  

Most findings are subtle, not dramatic.

---

## What success looks like

A “successful” Dual DPIA check may conclude that:
- the DPIA exists  
- the scope is narrow and justified  
- safeguards are documented  
- risks are acknowledged and mitigated  

That is a good outcome.  
Reassurance is not failure.

If things are unclear, that too is information — but it does not require panic.

*Dual DPIA the Data Deals (Government Contracting Edition)* is a core method node within **🔮 Polishing Big Balls**.  
It exists to help people check whether public data contracts are governed as promised, without assuming failure or escalating prematurely.

The method relies on steadiness, specificity, and comparison — not confrontation.  
Where safeguards exist, the correct response is confidence.  
Where gaps appear, the next steps remain optional and proportionate.

This is paperwork work.  
It works best when it stays boring.
