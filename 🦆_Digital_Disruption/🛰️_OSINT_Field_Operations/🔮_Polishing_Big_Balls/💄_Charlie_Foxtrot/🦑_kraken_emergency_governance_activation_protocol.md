# 🦑 Kraken Emergency Governance Activation Protocol  
**First created:** 2026-01-23 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-23  
*Activating emergency governance when AI-affected systems pose preventative-death and systemic risk*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node defines **how and when UK governance must shift out of “business as usual”** when AI-affected systems pose a credible risk of:

- preventative death,  
- bureaucratic cascade failure, or  
- epistemic contamination of state decision-making.

It exists because UK systems are highly procedural, target-driven, and layered.  
When automation fails inside such systems, **harm does not appear as a single event** — it appears as delay, denial, exclusion, and exhaustion.

Emergency governance is not panic.  
It is **permission to act differently before people are harmed**.

---

## 🦴 Core Principle: Permission Saves Lives  
In UK governance, harm often occurs **not because people do not care**, but because:

- they fear breaching procedure,  
- they fear financial or disciplinary penalty,  
- they fear deviating from automated outputs,  
- or they assume anomalies are “their fault.”

This protocol exists to **explicitly suspend those constraints**.

If staff are not clearly authorised to override systems, **preventative death becomes inevitable**.

---

## 🚨 Trigger Conditions (Any One Is Sufficient)

Emergency governance **must be activated** if any of the following are true:

### 1️⃣ Preventative Death Risk Identified  
There is credible risk that an AI-affected system may contribute to:
- delayed diagnosis or referral  
- missed safeguarding escalation  
- stalled access to health or social care  
- misclassified mental health crises  
- housing or benefits disruption leading to deterioration  

If delay or denial could plausibly kill → **activate immediately**.

---

### 2️⃣ Bureaucratic Cascade Failure Risk  
There is evidence that:
- automated outputs are propagating through multiple systems, or  
- staff feel unable to override outputs, or  
- performance targets are enforcing harmful decisions.

---

### 3️⃣ Epistemic Integrity Risk  
AI outputs are:
- briefing senior officials,  
- shaping Cabinet or ministerial decisions,  
- influencing public-order or terrorism posture, or  
- relied upon despite weak datasets or opaque inference.

---

### 4️⃣ Unknown Scope, High Consequence  
The full impact is not yet known, but:
- affected systems are cross-sector, and  
- potential harms are severe.

**Uncertainty + severity = activation**, not delay.

---

## 🧭 Activation Authority  
Activation may be initiated by:
- Cabinet Office coordination,  
- departmental permanent secretaries,  
- national system leads (e.g. NHS England), or  
- authorised crisis coordination bodies.

Activation does **not** require:
- full attribution,  
- proof of wrongdoing, or  
- confirmed harm.

This is a **safety intervention**, not an accusation.

---

## 📣 The Emergency Governance Notice (EGN)
Activation is communicated via an **Emergency Governance Notice**.

This is an internal instrument — not a press release.

---

### Required Elements of an EGN

#### 1️⃣ Explicit Acknowledgement of Risk  
State clearly:
- anomalies are expected,  
- system outputs may be unreliable,  
- this is not staff error.

---

#### 2️⃣ Clear Permission to Override  
The EGN **must include explicit authorisation**:

> “During this period, staff are authorised and expected to prioritise human judgement, patient safety, safeguarding, and legal compliance over automated outputs, performance targets, and efficiency metrics.”

Without this sentence, activation fails.

---

#### 3️⃣ Suspension of Normal Constraints  
State clearly that, where necessary:
- performance targets may be overridden,  
- budgetary constraints may be deprioritised,  
- automated recommendations are advisory only.

This protection must include:
- clinical staff,  
- social workers,  
- council officers,  
- safeguarding leads,  
- frontline decision-makers.

---

#### 4️⃣ Protection From Penalty  
The notice must guarantee:

> “Decisions made in good faith under this notice will not attract disciplinary, performance, or financial penalty.”

Fear is a primary harm vector.  
This neutralises it.

---

#### 5️⃣ Simple Reporting Channel  
Require:
- brief logging of overrides or anomalies,  
- pattern capture, not blame,  
- escalation of serious concerns.

Do **not** introduce complex new bureaucracy.

---

## 🧬 Downstream Communication Cascade

Emergency governance must cascade in controlled stages:

### Tier 1 — Central Coordination  
- Cabinet Office or equivalent  
- Cross-sector situational awareness  
- Technical assurance inputs

---

### Tier 2 — National System Leadership  
- NHS England  
- UKHSA  
- LGA / regulators  
- Arms-length bodies

Receive:
- high-level risk framing,  
- authorisation language,  
- expectation of activation.

---

### Tier 3 — Regional & Local Leadership  
- ICBs  
- Trust CEOs  
- Council Chief Executives  
- Directors of Adult / Children’s Services

Receive:
- permission to suspend constraints,  
- instruction to protect staff discretion,  
- duty to prioritise safety and legality.

---

### Tier 4 — Frontline Staff  
Receive:
- reassurance,  
- clarity,  
- permission to slow down,  
- instruction to escalate concerns.

This is where lives are protected.

---

## 🛑 What Emergency Governance Is *Not*  
Emergency governance is **not**:
- public panic signalling  
- blame allocation  
- contract termination  
- legal adjudication  
- disciplinary action  

Those come later, if needed.

This phase is about **preventing harm now**.

---

## ⚠️ Failure Modes (Explicitly Flagged)

Activation fails if:
- permission is vague,  
- targets remain enforced,  
- staff fear consequences,  
- anomalies are minimised,  
- reporting becomes punitive.

These conditions recreate the very harm the protocol exists to stop.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters in the UK  
In UK systems:
- harm is often legal,  
- harm is often procedural,  
- harm is often deniable,  
- harm is often slow.

Emergency governance interrupts **structural violence disguised as normality**.

Preventative death is still death.  
Delay is still harm.  
Paperwork can still kill.
