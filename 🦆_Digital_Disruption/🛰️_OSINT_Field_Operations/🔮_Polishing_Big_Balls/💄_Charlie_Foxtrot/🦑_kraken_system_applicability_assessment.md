# 🦑 Kraken System Applicability Assessment  
**First created:** 2026-01-23 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-23  
*Determining when an AI-affected system constitutes a preventative-death and governance emergency*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This note answers a deceptively simple question:

> **Does this system require emergency governance handling under Kraken logic?**

In UK contexts, this is routinely mis-answered because **preventative death is not recognised as death** when it occurs through:
- administrative delay  
- eligibility thresholds  
- automated deprioritisation  
- risk scoring  
- silent exclusion  

In the UK’s interlinked social, health, and welfare systems, **a paperwork error can be lethal**.

---

## 🦴 Core Principle: Preventative Death Is a First-Order Risk  
Preventative death includes:
- delayed diagnosis  
- missed safeguarding escalation  
- denied or stalled social care  
- benefit or housing disruption  
- misclassified mental health crises  
- cumulative bureaucratic stress  

These deaths are:
- diffuse  
- under-recorded  
- structurally produced  

Under Kraken logic, **they are fatalities**.

---

## 🧭 Applicability Decision Test  

A system qualifies if **any one** test is met.

### 1️⃣ Life & Health Impact Test  
Does it influence:
- triage  
- referrals  
- discharge  
- mental health crisis response  
- safeguarding  
- access to care  

→ Kraken applies immediately.

---

### 2️⃣ Bureaucratic Enforcement Test  
Does it feed into:
- eligibility  
- benefits  
- housing  
- social care  
- compliance or fraud flags  

→ Kraken applies.

---

### 3️⃣ Human Override Suppression Test  
Does it:
- present outputs as authoritative  
- penalise deviation  
- embed into targets  
- suppress discretion  

→ Kraken applies.

---

### 4️⃣ Epistemic Authority Test  
Does it:
- brief ministers  
- shape Cabinet decisions  
- influence public-order posture  
- underpin terrorism assessments  

→ Kraken applies.

---

### 5️⃣ Small-n / Proxy Profiling Test  
Does it rely on:
- tiny samples  
- proxy traits  
- extrapolation from individuals  
- opaque confidence  

→ Kraken applies.

---

## 🧨 UK-Specific Risk Multipliers  
Automatic elevation if used in:
- NHS / ICBs  
- local authorities  
- social care  
- housing  
- safeguarding  
- mental health  
- benefits-adjacent systems  

Delay or denial here can kill **without audit visibility**.

---

## ⚠️ Common Policy Misjudgements  
Incorrect assumptions:
- “It’s only admin”  
- “It’s only healthcare”  
- “It’s only advisory”  
- “No evidence of harm yet”  

In layered systems:
advisory → behaviour → access → survival.

---

## 🛑 When Kraken May Not Apply  
Only if **all** are true:
- no health or liberty impact  
- discretion protected  
- provenance explicit  
- no proxy profiling  
- no cross-sector reuse  

Otherwise, reassess.

---

## 🧠 Why This Note Exists  
Policy culture recognises:
- violent death  
- overt criminality  

It misses:
- administrative death  
- delay-induced death  
- exclusion-driven death  

Kraken applicability begins when this denial ends.
