# 🦑 Kraken Immediate Risk Categories  
**First created:** 2026-01-23 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-23  
*Identifying and prioritising immediate harm pathways in AI-affected UK systems*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
When AI-affected systems fail in the UK, harm rarely presents as a single, dramatic event.  
It presents as **categories of risk moving at different speeds through different layers of the state**.

This node exists to stop decision-makers collapsing everything into “AI risk” and instead force a clear question:

> **What kind of harm is this system capable of causing right now, and how fast?**

Misclassifying the risk category leads to the wrong response — often fatally late.

---

## 🦴 Core Principle: Different Risks Require Different Speeds  
Not all risks escalate on the same timeline.

Some kill **quickly but quietly**.  
Some erode legitimacy **slowly but irreversibly**.  
Some spread through bureaucracy **without anyone noticing until it’s everywhere**.

Kraken logic requires naming the category **before** choosing the response.

---

## 🚨 Category 1: Preventative Death Risk (Highest Priority)

### Definition  
Risk that an AI-affected system contributes to **death or serious harm through delay, denial, misclassification, or exclusion**, rather than overt violence.

### Typical pathways  
- Triage deprioritisation  
- Missed or delayed referrals  
- Safeguarding thresholds not met  
- Mental health crises classified as “low risk”  
- Social care delays leading to deterioration  
- Housing or benefits disruption triggering health collapse  

### Why this is missed  
- Death appears indirect  
- Causation is diffuse  
- Harm looks administrative  
- Responsibility is fragmented  

### Kraken response  
- **Immediate emergency governance activation**
- Human override mandatory
- Targets and efficiency suspended
- Safety > procedure > cost

### Key rule  
> If delay or denial could plausibly kill, **this category overrides all others**.

---

## ⚠️ Category 2: Bureaucratic Cascade Failure

### Definition  
Risk that flawed AI outputs propagate through **interconnected UK systems**, producing compounding harm that appears “procedurally correct.”

### Typical pathways  
- Risk scores feeding eligibility decisions  
- Flags triggering enforcement or investigation  
- Automated prioritisation shaping queues  
- Performance metrics enforcing bad outcomes  
- Local systems inheriting upstream errors  

### Why this is dangerous  
- Each step appears compliant  
- No single decision looks lethal  
- Staff feel trapped by process  
- Harm accelerates downstream  

### Kraken response  
- Emergency Governance Notice issued
- Explicit permission to override
- Suspension of automated enforcement
- Rapid pattern logging (not blame)

### Key rule  
> If staff feel unable to intervene, **the cascade has already begun**.

---

## 🧠 Category 3: Epistemic Contamination of Policy

### Definition  
Risk that weak, biased, or opaque AI outputs distort **senior understanding**, leading to illegitimate or unsafe policy decisions.

### Typical pathways  
- Population analytics briefing ministers  
- Sentiment analysis shaping public-order posture  
- Small-n inference presented as representative  
- Proxy profiling influencing security assessments  
- Models treated as evidence rather than hypothesis  

### Why this matters  
- Decisions appear rational but are unsound  
- Errors scale nationally  
- Legitimacy erodes quietly  
- Legal challenges surface later, harder  

### Kraken response  
- Quarantine outputs from decision-making
- Require provenance, n-size, and uncertainty
- Reframe outputs as exploratory only
- Independent review before reuse

### Key rule  
> Bad information at the top poisons everything below.

---

## ⚖️ Category 4: Unlawful Exclusion or Coercion

### Definition  
Risk that AI systems contribute to **rights violations**, discriminatory outcomes, or coercive state action.

### Typical pathways  
- Benefits denial or suspension  
- Housing enforcement prioritisation  
- Fraud or risk labelling without due process  
- Immigration-health crossover failures  
- Protected group proxy inference  

### Kraken response  
- Legal review triggered
- Automated denial suspended
- Human review mandated
- Evidence standards raised immediately

---

## 🧨 Category 5: Reputational & Legitimacy Fracture

### Definition  
Risk that public trust in UK institutions collapses due to perceived:
- secrecy,
- unfairness,
- or preventable harm.

### Typical triggers  
- NHS involvement  
- Safeguarding failures  
- Evidence of profiling  
- NDA-based silence  
- Appearance of cover-up  

### Kraken response  
- Protective competence narrative
- Evidence preservation
- Clear sequencing: safety → truth → accountability
- Avoid premature denial

---

## 🧭 Using This Node in Practice

### Step 1  
Identify **all applicable categories**.  
Most real incidents involve more than one.

### Step 2  
Act at the **speed of the fastest harm**, not the loudest concern.

### Step 3  
Apply the **highest-priority response** across the system.

Preventative death > bureaucratic cascade > epistemic contamination > legitimacy damage.

## ⚠️ Common Failure Pattern (Explicitly Flagged)
A frequent mistake is treating:
- Category 1 harm  
as if it were  
- Category 3 debate.

This results in:
- reviews instead of action,
- papers instead of permission,
- and deaths that later appear “unavoidable.”

They are not.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters in the UK  
UK governance systems are:
- procedurally dense,
- historically layered,
- and socially trusted.

When they harm, the harm is:
- quiet,
- deniable,
- and devastating.

Naming the risk category is how you stop politeness from killing people.
