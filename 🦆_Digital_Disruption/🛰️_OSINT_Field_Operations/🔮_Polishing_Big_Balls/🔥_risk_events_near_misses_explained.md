# 🔥 Risk Events & Near Misses Explained  
**First created:** 2026-01-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*What gets logged long before anything is called a breach — and why that layer matters.*

---

Most data protection problems do **not** begin as breaches.

They begin as:
- small errors  
- unexpected behaviour  
- process failures  
- things that “didn’t quite work as intended”  

These are usually recorded internally, quietly, and routinely.  
Understanding this layer helps explain why organisations can truthfully say *“no breaches occurred”* while still sitting on a pile of unresolved risk.

## What a “risk event” actually is

A **data protection risk event** is any occurrence that:
- exposes a weakness in how data is handled  
- reveals a control that didn’t work as designed  
- increases risk to individuals, even if no harm occurred  

Examples include:
- data sent to the wrong internal team but recalled  
- access controls misconfigured and later corrected  
- a system behaving in an unexpected way  
- a DPIA risk materialising in practice, but being contained  

Nothing dramatic has to happen for something to be logged.

This is normal governance.

## Near misses: borrowed from safety culture

A **near miss** is an event where:
- harm *could* have occurred  
- but didn’t, because someone noticed or intervened  

Healthcare, aviation, and critical infrastructure all treat near misses as valuable signals. Data protection borrows this logic for the same reason: waiting for harm is a bad way to learn.

Near misses are:
- encouraged to be reported  
- discussed internally  
- used to adjust processes  

They are not admissions of guilt.  
They are evidence of monitoring.

## Non-breach ≠ non-problem

A key distinction:

- **Personal data breach** → a defined legal threshold  
- **Risk event / near miss** → an internal warning light  

Most issues never cross the breach threshold. That does not mean:
- the system is perfect  
- the risk was imaginary  
- the problem is resolved forever  

It usually means:
- controls worked *this time*  
- or someone caught the issue early  

Those events are still logged — or should be.

---

## Where these records usually live

Risk events and near misses commonly appear in:
- risk registers  
- incident logs (with “non-breach” classification)  
- assurance trackers  
- DPIA risk tables  
- internal audit findings  
- lessons-learned documents  

They are often:
- fragmented across teams  
- written in cautious language  
- easy to miss unless you know they exist  

They rarely make headlines — but they shape decisions.

---

## Why this matters for public data services

In complex, layered systems:
- small failures can repeat quietly  
- the same risk can resurface in different contracts  
- responsibility can blur across controllers and processors  

Patterns of near misses may reveal:
- chronic under-resourcing  
- over-reliance on vendors  
- tools reused beyond their original scope  
- safeguards that exist on paper but strain in practice  

None of this requires a breach to be real.

---

## What you can reasonably expect

From a well-governed organisation, it is reasonable to expect:
- that risk events are recorded  
- that near misses are discussed  
- that patterns are reviewed  
- that mitigations are updated  

From the outside, you may not see full detail — but the **existence** of these processes matters.

Total silence is not a virtue.

---

## Why this layer is often misunderstood

Public discourse tends to split things into:
- “nothing happened”  
- “a scandal occurred”  

Real governance lives in between.

Risk events and near misses are the space where:
- systems learn (or fail to)  
- problems can be fixed early  
- harm can be prevented  

Understanding this layer reduces panic — and sharpens scrutiny.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Risk Events & Near Misses Explained* is a grounding node within **🔮 Polishing Big Balls**.  
It exists to clarify a layer of governance that is both routine and easily misunderstood.

The presence of recorded risk events is not a failure.  
The absence of any record at all is what warrants attention.

Most systems fail slowly and quietly.  
This is where you can see it happening — early, and without spectacle.
