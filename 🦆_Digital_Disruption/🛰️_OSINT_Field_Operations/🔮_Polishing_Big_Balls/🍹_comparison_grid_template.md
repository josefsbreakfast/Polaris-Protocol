# 🍹 Comparison Grid Template  
**First created:** 2026-01-08 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*A simple way to line up what different actors say against what actually appears.*

---

This grid exists to support **calm comparison**, not argument.

It is used after you have:
- identified a specific public data service  
- received responses from a controller and/or processor  
- and, where applicable, a SAR response  

The goal is not to fill every cell.  
The goal is to notice **alignment, gaps, and drift**.

## Comparison Grid  
*(Controller vs Processor vs SAR)*

| Dimension | Controller (FOI / response) | Processor (vendor response) | SAR / lived data |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Role claimed | | | |
| Stated purpose | | | |
| Legal basis cited | | | |
| DPIA existence | | | |
| DPIA date / timing | | | |
| DPIA scope | | | |
| Profiling acknowledged | | | |
| Inference / derived data | | | |
| Special category data | | | |
| Human review described | | | |
| Automation denied / limited | | | |
| Retention period | | | |
| Data sharing described | | | |
| Risk language used | | | |
| Safeguards claimed | | | |
| What is *not* mentioned | | | |

You can add or remove rows as needed.  
Blank cells are not failures — they are signals.

## How to read the grid

Look for:
- **consistency** across columns  
- **timing mismatches** (e.g. DPIA after deployment)  
- **scope drift** between “advisory” and operational use  
- **language shifts** (certainty vs hedging)  

Pay special attention to:
- things that appear in one column but not the others  
- repeated phrases across different organisations  
- claims that are difficult to reconcile with lived data  

You are comparing *descriptions*, not intentions.

## What this grid is not

This grid is not:
- proof of wrongdoing  
- a scoring system  
- a checklist you must complete  

It is a **thinking aid**.

Often the most useful outcome is simply being able to say:
> “These three accounts do not fully line up.”

That observation alone is enough to proceed carefully — or to stop.

⚖️ 🧭 🛰️ 🧠 🧩 — evidentiary comparison, administrative records, controller/processor roles, inference visibility.

## ✨ Stardust  
side-by-side reading, alignment vs drift, absence as signal, paperwork as evidence, comparison without accusation

## 🏮 Footer  

*🍹 Comparison Grid Template* is a supporting artefact within **🔮 Polishing Big Balls**.  
It exists to slow thinking down, reduce emotional load, and make complex systems legible through simple juxtaposition.

The grid does not tell you what to conclude.  
It helps you see what is already there.
