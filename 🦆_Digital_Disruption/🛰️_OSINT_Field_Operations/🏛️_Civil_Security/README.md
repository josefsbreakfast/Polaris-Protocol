# 🏛️ Civil Security  
**First created:** 2025-11-04  |  **Last updated:** 2025-11-04  
*A civic OSINT investigation into how democratic oversight erodes quietly — and how to detect it before it formalises.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
**Civil Security** examines the everyday architectures that make soft authoritarianism look like ordinary administration.  
It maps the weak points of local-government governance — procurement loops, surveillance frameworks, fiscal dependencies — and treats them as **open-source intelligence problems** rather than mysteries.  

This cluster sits at the intersection of governance ecology and civic forensics:  
where **administration becomes security theatre**, and where transparency work becomes a form of counter-intelligence in defence of democracy.

## 🕵️‍♀️ OSINT Mandate  
Civil Security uses open-source intelligence to:  

1. **Identify structural vulnerabilities** — legal, financial, or informational chokepoints within local-authority systems.  
2. **Trace influence networks** — map where private or foreign-linked capital intersects with statutory duties.  
3. **Audit rhetoric** — detect linguistic drift from accountability toward “risk management” or “reputation protection.”  
4. **Preserve evidence integrity** — maintain append-only archives and independent version control for all civic data.  
5. **Model counter-strategies** — design transparent oversight mechanisms that can operate in real time, not retrospectively.

## 🏮 Footer  
*Civil Security* is a live investigative cluster of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents the subtle mechanics of civic containment and develops counter-methods rooted in transparency, technical literacy, and public sovereignty.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
