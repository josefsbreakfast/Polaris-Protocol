# 📡 Reform and Local Capture — OSINT Brief  
**First created:** 2025-11-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-04  
*A live investigation tracking how opaque political-corporate structures leverage local government to accumulate soft power.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This OSINT brief examines the pattern of **Reform UK’s expansion into local councils** and uses it as a working case study of how political movements structured as private companies can operate inside the *soft governance perimeter*.  
The goal is not to speculate on motive but to map **structural risk** — the channels through which opaque funding and corporate alignments could reshape British civic decision-making from the inside out.

The case forms part of the wider *Civil Security* investigation into local capture and the quieting of democratic oversight.

## 🧩 Key Questions  

1. **Structural:** How does incorporation under company law, rather than PPERA party law, alter financial-transparency obligations?  
2. **Operational:** What are the geographic and demographic patterns of Reform UK’s council-level candidacies and wins?  
3. **Network:** Which companies, donors, or media platforms overlap with its leadership or messaging ecosystem?  
4. **Influence:** How might local authority control translate into procurement leverage, communications framing, or narrative steering?  
5. **Precedent:** If similar entities acted with explicit anti-democratic aims, what defensive mechanisms (legal, technical, civic) would fail first?

## 🕵️ OSINT Sources and Methods  

| Source Type | Method | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Companies House filings** | Track corporate structure, officers, shareholdings, and filings for Reform UK Ltd and associated entities. | Confirms corporate rather than party governance. |
| **Electoral Commission data** | Analyse spending returns, donor disclosures, and local-election reports. | Identify disclosure asymmetries. |
| **Council election results (2023-25)** | Map geographic clusters of council seats and vote share. | Detect entry points and concentrations. |
| **Freedom of Information (FOI)** | Request business-rate concentration data, local partnership records, and procurement with Reform-affiliated actors. | Reveals local dependency networks. |
| **Media & social networks** | OSINT scrape of messaging, partnerships, endorsements, and advertising footprints. | Identify soft-power alliances and amplification vectors. |
| **Lobbying registers** | Check for declared contacts between Reform UK figures and local-government or central-department officials. | Cross-validate influence mapping. |

## 📊 Initial Observations  

- **Transparency asymmetry** allows a private-company political body to operate in electoral space without full donor disclosure.  
- **Local footholds** multiply influence cheaply: each council seat provides access to regeneration, planning, and procurement levers.  
- **Soft-power diffusion:** messaging and reputation management spread through community partnerships and local media without requiring formal control.  
- **Regulatory lag:** existing electoral and financial oversight frameworks treat local capture as benign until national relevance is reached.

## ⚙️ Analytical Focus  

1. **Capture Mechanics:** follow money, messaging, and management decisions from company filings to council budgets.  
2. **Containment Reflex:** document how local-authority risk management responds to scrutiny (e.g., deflection via reputational framing).  
3. **Resilience Mapping:** identify councils with transparent business-rate data, independent scrutiny committees, or citizen audit movements.  
4. **Comparative Baselines:** study parallel cases in other democracies (Austria, Italy, U.S. state-level) where corporate political movements leveraged local office.

## 🧭 Next Investigative Steps  

- Compile a dataset of **Reform UK council candidates 2023-2025**, including declared interests and cross-company links.  
- Cross-reference with **Companies House**, **OpenCorporates**, and **WhoOwnsWho** data to visualise corporate overlap.  
- Launch FOI pilot: request anonymised **business-rate dependency tables** and **supplier-relationship registers** for three councils with Reform UK representation.  
- Prepare **timeline and map visualisation** for inclusion in the Civil Security atlas.
