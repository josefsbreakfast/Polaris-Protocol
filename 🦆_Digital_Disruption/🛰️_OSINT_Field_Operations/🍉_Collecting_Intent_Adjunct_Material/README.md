# 🍉 Collecting Intent Adjunct Material  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-05  
*Distributed OSINT practices for preserving contextual evidence relevant to intent, anticipation, and evidentiary suppression.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This folder supports **open-source collection of contextual material relevant to intent** in mass-atrocity and genocide-adjacent situations, particularly where:

- violence continues under claims of restraint or ceasefire,
- early warning voices are chilled or silenced,
- expert and witness pathways are disrupted,
- and public understanding is managed in advance of or during escalation.

This is **not** an inquiry, tribunal, or authority.  
It is an **evidentiary commons** designed to preserve material that would otherwise decay, disappear, or be dismissed as anecdotal.

In the current context, this includes situations where a *declared ceasefire exists while lethal force continues*.

---

## 🎯 Scope

This directory concerns **adjunct material** that may support inference of intent, knowledge, anticipation, or foreseeability when read alongside other evidence.

It focuses on **patterns and conditions**, not accusations.

Relevant contexts include:

- pre-emptive silencing of witnesses, experts, journalists, or early-warning researchers  
- abnormal pressure on role-defined professional cohorts  
- regulatory or complaint-based friction that exceeds normal baselines  
- narrative inoculation prior to kinetic escalation  
- suppression or delay of warning signals relevant to third-state knowledge  
- evidentiary absence plausibly linked to fear, pressure, or risk  

Material here **does not claim genocidal intent on its own**.  
It exists to support **contextual, circumstantial inference**.

---

## 🧠 What Counts as “Intent Adjunct Material”

Examples include (non-exhaustive):

- timelines showing expert or witness withdrawal before escalation  
- aggregated complaint-rate anomalies against specific professional roles  
- self-reported disclosures of harassment, surveillance, or intimidation  
- platform moderation, visibility throttling, or account disruption affecting key voices  
- coordinated narrative shifts across media or political discourse  
- unexplained silences, delays, or absences aligned with legally salient moments  

The emphasis is always on:

> **patterns, timing, role specificity, and effect**

—not on motive attribution or speculation.

---

## 🧰 Contribution Principles

All contributions should be:

- **Descriptive, not accusatory**  
- **Aggregate-first, individual-second**  
- **Timestamped and source-linked**  
- **Clear about uncertainty and limits**  
- **Replicable by others**  

This work **explicitly avoids**:
- allegations of bribery or blackmail  
- claims of secret coordination  
- naming perpetrators beyond what is already public  

Risk ≠ proof.  
Silence ≠ guilt.

## 🛡️ For Journalists, Researchers & Constrained Professionals

This directory explicitly recognises a modern reality:

> Many people with relevant knowledge are **institutionally constrained** from publishing, speaking, or formally testifying — even where serious harm is foreseeable.

This folder exists to provide a **low-risk, decentralised pathway** for contributing to genocide-prevention obligations **without requiring employer approval, public attribution, or singular exposure**.

### ⚖️ Individual Responsibility Under the Genocide Convention

The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide presumes:

- awareness,
- reasonable foresight,
- and duties to act *when one can*.

Contributing to open-source contextual documentation — even without formal publication — is a legitimate way to:

- preserve warning signals,  
- prevent evidentiary erasure,  
- and signal persistent public concern.

Institutional silence does not extinguish individual ethical responsibility.  
But **risk-aware contribution matters**.

---

## 🔐 Open Source, Not Exposure

Contributions here may be made:

- without bylines,  
- without narrative commentary,  
- without public claims of authorship,  
- using basic digital hygiene and compartmentalisation.

This is not about bypassing employers.  
It is about ensuring the **historical and evidentiary record exists**.

Metadata persistence itself is a signal.

---

## 🧭 Relationship to Other Accountability Efforts

This directory is **complementary**, not duplicative.

- Projects such as **[Accountability Archive](https://accountabilityarchive.org/)** focus on **explicit expressions of genocidal intent** — statements or posts advocating destruction, removal, or death of a protected group.

- *🍉 Collecting Intent Adjunct Material* focuses on a related but distinct question:

  > **Was there anticipatory chilling or silencing of witnesses, experts, or warning systems before or during escalation?**

Both forms of documentation are necessary.
They speak to **different evidentiary dimensions** of intent, knowledge, and foreseeability.

---

## 🚩 Platform Flagging Still Matters (Even When Nothing Happens)

While collecting or reviewing material, contributors may encounter:

- explicit genocidal advocacy,
- anti-Palestinian racism,
- incitement framed as “policy debate”.

Even when:
- content is not removed,
- enforcement appears inconsistent,
- no immediate action is taken,

**flagging is not wasted effort**.

Aggregate flag data:
- feeds internal platform risk dashboards,
- surfaces in board-level governance discussions,
- informs reputational and regulatory risk assessments.

Capital responds to **persistent moral liability signals**, not single reports.

Flagging is a form of *metadata pressure*.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists (Plainly)

This work exists to ensure that:

- warning signals existed,
- concerns were raised,
- suppression was observable,
- and ignorance was not inevitable.

In situations where violence continues under claims of restraint or ceasefire, **documenting contradiction matters**.

If future accountability asks:

> “Why didn’t anyone say anything?”

This record exists so the answer is:

> **People did — consistently, carefully, and in the open evidentiary record.**
