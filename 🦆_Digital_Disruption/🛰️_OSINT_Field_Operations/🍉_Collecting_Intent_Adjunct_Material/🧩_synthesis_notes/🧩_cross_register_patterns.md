# 🧩 Cross-Register Patterns  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Observations that emerge only when multiple evidence registers are read together.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node records **observations that arise across multiple evidence registers**.

It does not introduce new material.
It does not assert conclusions.

Its function is to describe **relationships between already-documented patterns**.

---

## 🧠 What This Node Does

This node:

- reads across registers,
- notes recurring alignments,
- identifies co-occurrence,
- and records stability over time.

It answers the question:

> *What becomes visible only when these registers are read together?*

---

## 🧩 How Cross-Register Patterns Are Identified

A cross-register pattern exists when:

- signals appear in **two or more registers**, and
- affect a **similar role-defined cohort**, and
- align temporally with **escalation, scrutiny, or legal thresholds**, and
- persist beyond a single incident.

Examples of cross-register alignment may include:

- complaint spikes coinciding with withdrawal or silence,
- narrative shifts aligning with platform visibility changes,
- expert withdrawal following regulatory or reputational pressure,
- early-warning suppression preceding claims of ignorance.

These are **descriptive alignments**, not causal claims.

---

## ⚠️ Important Limits

This node does **not**:

- assert coordination,
- infer motive,
- identify perpetrators,
- or convert patterns into legal findings.

All observations remain:
- conditional,
- revisable,
- and dependent on underlying registers.

---

## 🧭 Why This Node Exists

In many accountability contexts, evidence is dismissed because it appears fragmented.

This node exists to show that:
- fragmentation itself can be patterned,
- and that context often lives **between** datasets.

It preserves the analytical step without performing adjudication.

---

## 🧠 Update Discipline

This node should be updated only when:

- patterns recur across time,
- alignment remains stable,
- and new material does not substantially change interpretation.

If uncertainty increases, note that explicitly.
