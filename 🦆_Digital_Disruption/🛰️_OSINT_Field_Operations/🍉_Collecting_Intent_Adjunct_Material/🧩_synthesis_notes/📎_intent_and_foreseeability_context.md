# 📎 Intent and Foreseeability — Contextual Notes  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*How accumulated contextual material may inform questions of intent, knowledge, and foreseeability.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node explains **how material collected in this directory may be relevant** to legal or historical reasoning about intent and foreseeability.

It does not claim to establish intent.
It does not apply legal tests.

Its purpose is to **frame relevance**, not to reach conclusions.

---

## 🧠 Intent as Inference, Not Assertion

In mass-atrocity and genocide contexts, intent is typically inferred from:

- anticipation and preparation,
- knowledge of likely consequences,
- consistency of conduct,
- and management of accountability risk.

This directory preserves **contextual material** relevant to those inferences — particularly where:

- warning signals existed,
- knowledge-bearers were constrained,
- and evidentiary absence was later invoked.

---

## 🕰️ Foreseeability and “Ought to Have Known”

Foreseeability concerns whether harm:

- was predictable,
- was warned about,
- or should reasonably have been anticipated.

Contextual material documenting:
- early warnings,
- expert silencing,
- narrative inoculation,
- or visibility suppression

may inform assessments of what was **knowable**, even if ignored.

---

## ⚖️ Relationship to Formal Legal Reasoning

This node does **not**:

- substitute for judicial findings,
- assert that legal thresholds are met,
- or weigh evidence probabilistically.

It exists to ensure that:
> **conditions affecting knowledge and warning are not erased from later analysis.**

Legal interpretation belongs to courts.
This work preserves the **record they may later need**.

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Historically, accountability has often failed because:

- warning signs were dismissed as isolated,
- silence was treated as absence,
- or suppression was normalised.

This node exists so that future review can say:

> *The context was visible at the time.*

---

## 🧠 Update Discipline

This node should change rarely.

Updates should:
- reflect stable patterns,
- note shifts in interpretation,
- or explicitly record uncertainty.

If material no longer supports a prior framing, that should be documented.
