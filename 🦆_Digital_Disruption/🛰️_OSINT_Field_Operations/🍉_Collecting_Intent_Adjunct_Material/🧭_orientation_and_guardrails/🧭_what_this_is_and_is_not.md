# 🧭 What This Is — and What It Is Not  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-05  
*Scope, limits, and guardrails for collecting intent-adjunct OSINT material.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node defines the **scope boundaries** for *🍉 Collecting Intent Adjunct Material*.

Its purpose is simple:
- to prevent misinterpretation,
- to limit overreach,
- and to make the intent of this work legible to journalists, researchers, courts, and future reviewers.

This file is a **guardrail**, not a manifesto.

---

## ✅ What This *Is*

This work **is**:

- A **decentralised OSINT practice** for preserving contextual material relevant to *intent, anticipation, knowledge, and foreseeability* in mass-atrocity and genocide-adjacent contexts.
- A method for **documenting patterns** that affect the availability, safety, or visibility of witnesses, experts, journalists, and early-warning signals.
- A way to **prevent evidentiary erasure** where material pressure, chilling effects, or silencing may later be denied or minimised.
- A **background record** that can support serious legal, journalistic, academic, or historical work without asserting conclusions.

This work focuses on **conditions and effects**, not hidden motives.

---

## ❌ What This Is *Not*

This work is **not**:

- An inquiry, tribunal, commission, or fact-finding authority.
- A list of perpetrators, collaborators, or targets.
- An allegation of conspiracy, secret coordination, or criminal intent.
- A substitute for formal investigations, court proceedings, or journalistic verification.
- A campaign, call to action, or mobilisation strategy.

Nothing in this directory should be read as:
- assigning guilt,
- proving intent on its own,
- or asserting causation beyond what the evidence supports.

---

## 🧠 The Core Distinction

This work draws a strict line between:

> **Documenting observable patterns**  
> *and*  
> **Attributing motive or responsibility**

Only the first is done here.

Intent, where relevant, is treated as a **legal inference** that may be drawn *elsewhere* — not a claim asserted in these materials.

---

## 📏 Evidentiary Posture

All material collected under this directory is intended to be:

- **Descriptive** rather than interpretive  
- **Aggregate-first** rather than individual-focused  
- **Timestamped and source-linked**  
- **Explicit about uncertainty and limits**  

Silence, withdrawal, or absence is recorded **as a condition**, not as wrongdoing.

Risk ≠ proof.  
Pressure ≠ corruption.  
Absence ≠ intent.

---

## ⚖️ Relationship to Legal Accountability

This work exists because courts and accountability processes routinely consider:

- context,
- patterns of interference,
- intimidation or chilling effects,
- obstruction of evidence,
- and conditions affecting what could reasonably be known.

The material here is intended to support **contextual understanding**, not to replace legal standards of proof.

---

## 🔐 Safety, Risk, and Restraint

This directory is deliberately structured to:

- avoid concentrating risk on individuals,
- avoid unnecessary exposure,
- and avoid claims that could endanger contributors or subjects.

Where possible:
- roles matter more than names,
- patterns matter more than anecdotes,
- persistence matters more than visibility.

---

## 🧭 Why This Guardrail Exists

Without clear boundaries, documentation work in high-conflict contexts tends to drift into:
- accusation,
- speculation,
- or advocacy framed as evidence.

This node exists to **stop that drift**.

It protects:
- contributors,
- the integrity of the record,
- and the future usability of the material.
