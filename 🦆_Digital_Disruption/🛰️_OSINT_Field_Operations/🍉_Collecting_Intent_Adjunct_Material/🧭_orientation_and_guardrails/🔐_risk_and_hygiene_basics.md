# 🔐 Risk and Hygiene Basics  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Practical restraint and safety principles for decentralised OSINT contribution.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node sets out **basic risk-reduction and hygiene principles** for contributing to open-source documentation in sensitive contexts.

It is intentionally:
- non-technical,
- non-paranoid,
- and non-operational.

This is about **restraint**, not evasion.

---

## 🧠 First Principle: Do Not Become the Story

The purpose of this work is to preserve patterns and context — **not** to elevate individual contributors.

If your contribution would:
- expose you unnecessarily,
- draw attention away from the material,
- or require personal justification,

it is probably **too much**.

Boring is safer.  
Aggregate is safer.  
Anonymous is often safer.

---

## 📏 Contribute at the Lowest Necessary Resolution

Prefer:
- links over commentary,
- timestamps over interpretation,
- summaries over screenshots,
- aggregates over individuals.

Ask:
> “What is the minimum information needed for this to be useful?”

Then stop there.

---

## 🧾 Separate Observation From Interpretation

When contributing material:
- clearly distinguish *what happened* from *what it might suggest*,
- avoid embedding conclusions in descriptions,
- let patterns emerge through accumulation.

Interpretation belongs in synthesis nodes — not in raw logs.

---

## 👤 Names, Attribution, and Exposure

Where possible:
- focus on roles rather than individuals,
- rely on already-public sources,
- avoid naming private individuals unnecessarily.

If naming is unavoidable, ensure:
- the source is public,
- the description is factual,
- no inference of wrongdoing is implied.

---

## 🕰️ Delay Is Acceptable

You do not need to document everything immediately.

Sometimes:
- waiting reduces risk,
- aggregation clarifies relevance,
- hindsight improves accuracy.

There is no prize for speed here.

---

## 🚩 Emotional Hygiene

This work often intersects with:
- distressing material,
- moral injury,
- frustration at inaction.

You are allowed to:
- step away,
- contribute less,
- contribute quietly,
- or stop entirely.

Sustainability matters more than volume.

## 🧭 A Note for Constrained Professionals

If you are:
- institutionally constrained,
- unable to publish,
- or concerned about professional repercussions,

remember:
- contributing context is not the same as public advocacy,
- metadata persistence matters even without visibility,
- absence of authorship does not equal absence of action.

Risk-aware contribution is still contribution.
