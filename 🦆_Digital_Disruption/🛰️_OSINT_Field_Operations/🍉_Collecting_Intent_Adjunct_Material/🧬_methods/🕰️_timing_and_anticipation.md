*Why temporal alignment transforms context into evidence.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node explains why **timing** is often the most probative feature of contextual evidence.

Patterns acquire meaning not just from *what* happens, but from *when*.

---

## 🧠 The Importance of Sequence

Actions may appear benign in isolation but become significant when they:
- precede escalation,
- align with legal thresholds,
- or anticipate foreseeable scrutiny.

Anticipatory conduct is legally relevant because it implies **expectation**, not reaction.

---

## ⏳ What Counts as Anticipation

Anticipation may be indicated by:
- silencing before violence intensifies,
- narrative framing before facts are established,
- pressure applied before accountability triggers,
- or withdrawal of voices ahead of public awareness.

Timing helps distinguish:
- preparation from response,
- foresight from hindsight.

## 🧭 Why This Matters for Intent

Courts infer intent by examining whether:
- harmful outcomes were foreseeable,
- steps were taken to manage consequences,
- and risks were mitigated in advance.

Temporal alignment is often the strongest circumstantial signal of such foresight.
