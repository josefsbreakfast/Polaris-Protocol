*How normal professional risk is distinguished from abnormal pressure.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node explains how **baselines** are established and how **anomalies** are identified relative to them.

It exists to avoid treating expected friction as evidence of suppression.

---

## 🧠 Establishing a Baseline

A baseline represents **normal conditions** for a given role, sector, or activity.

Baselines may include:
- historical complaint rates,
- known levels of professional dispute,
- typical regulatory scrutiny,
- ordinary media criticism,
- or routine platform moderation.

Baselines must be:
- role-specific,
- context-aware,
- and time-bounded.

## 📈 What Makes Something an Anomaly

An anomaly occurs when outcomes:
- exceed expected variance,
- spike sharply within a short timeframe,
- disproportionately affect a narrow cohort,
- or diverge from peer comparators.

Anomalies are identified statistically where possible, or descriptively where data is limited.

---

## ⚠️ Important Constraints

Not every increase is meaningful.

An anomaly must be:
- unlikely under ordinary conditions,
- resistant to benign explanation,
- and temporally or structurally clustered.

Single incidents do not constitute anomalies.

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Regulators, courts, and auditors routinely assess:
- abnormal complaint volumes,
- disproportionate enforcement,
- and unexplained spikes

as **risk indicators**, not proof of wrongdoing.

This node aligns OSINT practice with that reasoning.
