# 🧬 Pattern and Deviation Analysis  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*How patterned effects and abnormal deviations are identified without overclaiming.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node defines how **patterns and deviations** are identified in decentralised OSINT work.

It exists to prevent two common failures:
- mistaking coincidence for significance, and
- mistaking intuition for method.

Pattern analysis here is **descriptive and comparative**, not accusatory.

---

## 🧠 What “Pattern” Means in This Context

A pattern is **not**:
- repetition alone,
- similarity of opinion,
- or multiple anecdotes pointing in the same direction.

A pattern exists when:
- similar effects recur,
- across multiple instances,
- affecting a role-defined cohort,
- under comparable conditions,
- within a meaningful timeframe.

Patterns are identified **across cases**, not within a single story.

---

## 📏 What Counts as a Deviation

A deviation is an outcome that:
- exceeds expected variance,
- departs from historical or peer baselines,
- clusters in time or role,
- or cannot be reasonably explained by ordinary professional risk.

Deviations matter **because they are improbable**, not because they are dramatic.

---

## 📊 Comparison Is the Core Method

Pattern analysis always requires a comparator.

Valid comparators include:
- historical baselines,
- peer cohorts with similar exposure,
- the same role in different time periods,
- or the same environment before and after escalation.

Without comparison, there is no deviation — only description.

## 🚫 What This Method Does Not Do

Pattern analysis here does **not**:
- infer motive,
- attribute coordination,
- identify perpetrators,
- or claim causation.

It identifies **effects** and **distributions**, not intent.

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Courts, regulators, and investigative bodies routinely rely on:
- abnormal clustering,
- disproportionate impact,
- and unexplained deviation

to decide when coincidence becomes implausible.

This node ensures that OSINT work aligns with that logic.
