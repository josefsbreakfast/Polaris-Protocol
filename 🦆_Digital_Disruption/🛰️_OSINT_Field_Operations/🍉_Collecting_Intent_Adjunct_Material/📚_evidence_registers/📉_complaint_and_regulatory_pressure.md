# 📉 Complaint and Regulatory Pressure Register  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-05  
*Aggregated logging of complaint, disciplinary, or regulatory pressure affecting role-defined cohorts.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This register logs **observable instances of complaint or regulatory pressure** affecting individuals or cohorts whose work is relevant to early warning, documentation, legal analysis, or public accountability.

This register does **not** assess the merits of complaints.
It records **volume, timing, clustering, and deviation**.

---

## 🧠 What Is Logged Here

Entries may include:

- professional complaints (e.g. to regulators, bar associations, ethics boards),
- disciplinary proceedings (formal or informal),
- regulatory scrutiny exceeding known baselines,
- repeated or parallel complaints against similar roles,
- public disclosures of complaint-related pressure.

Only **publicly available or self-disclosed information** should be logged.

---

## 📏 What Is *Not* Logged Here

This register does **not** include:

- speculation about complainants’ motives,
- assumptions of bad faith,
- conclusions about legitimacy,
- private or leaked materials,
- unverified allegations.

Complaint ≠ wrongdoing.  
Volume ≠ guilt.

---

## 🗂️ Entry Structure (Recommended)

Each entry should include, where possible:

- **Date / period**
- **Role affected** (not necessarily name)
- **Jurisdiction / regulator**
- **Type of pressure** (complaint, investigation, audit, etc.)
- **Public source or disclosure**
- **Notes on baseline comparison** (if known)

Interpretation belongs elsewhere.

## 🧭 Why This Register Exists

Abnormal complaint or regulatory pressure can be relevant **context** when it:

- exceeds role-specific baselines,
- clusters around legally salient moments,
- disproportionately affects a narrow cohort,
- or coincides with withdrawal or silence.

This register preserves the **raw conditions** needed for such analysis.
