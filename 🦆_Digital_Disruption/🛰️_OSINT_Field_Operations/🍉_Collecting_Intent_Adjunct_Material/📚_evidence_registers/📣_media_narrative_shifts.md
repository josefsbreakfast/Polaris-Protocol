# 📣 Media Narrative Shifts  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-06  
*Logging changes in framing, emphasis, or narrative treatment across media environments.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This register tracks **observable shifts in media framing** relevant to accountability, warning, or interpretation of events.

It records **what changed and when**, not why.

---

## 🧠 What Is Logged Here

Entries may include:

- changes in terminology or framing,
- sudden reframing of key actors or claims,
- disappearance or marginalisation of expert voices,
- consistent reframing across multiple outlets,
- timing of editorial shifts relative to events.

Only **publicly published material** should be logged.

---

## 📏 Important Limits

This register does **not**:

- assign editorial intent,
- allege coordination,
- judge journalistic ethics,
- or claim censorship.

Narrative shift ≠ manipulation.

---

## 🗂️ Entry Structure (Recommended)

Each entry should include:

- **Date / period**
- **Outlet or platform**
- **Description of shift**
- **Before / after comparison**
- **Public source**
- **Contextual timing**

---

## 🧭 Why This Register Exists

Narrative framing affects:

- public understanding,
- third-state knowledge,
- and thresholds for response.

Tracking shifts preserves context that may later be denied or normalised.
