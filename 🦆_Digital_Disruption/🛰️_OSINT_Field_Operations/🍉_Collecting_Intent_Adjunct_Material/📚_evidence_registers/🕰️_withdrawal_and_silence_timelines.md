# 🕰️ Withdrawal and Silence Timelines  
**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-05  
*Chronological logging of withdrawal, silence, or reduced participation by role-defined actors.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This register logs **observable withdrawal, silence, or delayed participation** by individuals or cohorts whose voices would ordinarily be expected in relevant contexts.

Silence is logged as a **condition**, not an accusation.

---

## 🧠 What Is Logged Here

Entries may include:

- sudden cessation of public commentary,
- withdrawal from proceedings, panels, or media,
- delayed or abandoned publications,
- resignations or stepping back from roles,
- explicit statements of inability to participate.

Only **publicly observable changes** should be logged.

---

## ❄️ What Silence Does *Not* Mean

Silence does **not** imply:

- fear,
- coercion,
- corruption,
- agreement,
- or intent.

This register does not infer motive.
It preserves **timing and effect**.

---

## 🗂️ Entry Structure (Recommended)

Each entry should include:

- **Date / period**
- **Role or function**
- **Nature of withdrawal or silence**
- **Previous level of engagement**
- **Public source or observation**
- **Relevant contextual timing** (e.g. escalation, hearings)

---

## 🧭 Why This Register Exists

When silence or withdrawal:

- deviates from historical norms,
- affects multiple actors in similar roles,
- clusters around escalation or scrutiny,

it may later help explain **evidentiary absence**.

This register ensures such absence is not misread as non-existence.
