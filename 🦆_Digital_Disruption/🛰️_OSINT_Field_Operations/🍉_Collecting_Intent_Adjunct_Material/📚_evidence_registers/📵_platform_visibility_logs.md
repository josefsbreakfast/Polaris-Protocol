**First created:** 2026-01-05 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-05  
*Logging observable platform-level visibility changes affecting relevant voices or material.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This register logs **observable changes in platform visibility** that affect the circulation of relevant material.

It does not assume intent or causation.
It records **effects and timing**.

---

## 🧠 What Is Logged Here

Entries may include:

- account suspensions or restrictions,
- unexplained reach collapses,
- content removals or labeling,
- shadow-banning indicators,
- repeated moderation affecting similar roles or topics.

Only **publicly observable or self-disclosed events** should be logged.

---

## ⚠️ Important Constraints

This register does **not**:

- claim censorship,
- allege coordination with states,
- infer platform motives,
- or assume political intent.

Platform action ≠ suppression.

---

## 🗂️ Entry Structure (Recommended)

Each entry should include:

- **Date / period**
- **Platform**
- **Type of visibility change**
- **Affected role or content type**
- **Public evidence or disclosure**
- **Contextual timing**

---

## 🧭 Why This Register Exists

Platform visibility affects:

- dissemination of warnings,
- public knowledge,
- and historical traceability.

When visibility changes cluster or align with escalation, they become **contextually relevant**.
