# 🪖 Home Front 2.0  
**First created:** 2025-10-28  | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*Antifascism for everyday life — making continuity an act of resistance.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
*Home Front 2.0* retools domestic, cultural, and civic habits into quiet forms of defiance.  
When information war is ambient, survival looks like: reading, repairing, tending, refusing spectacle.  
The kitchen table becomes a command centre; the library, a resistance cell.

---

## 🧩 Key Practices  
- **Make and Mend Republic** — reuse, repair, repurpose as refusal of planned obsolescence.  
- **Library Metrics and the One Book Civic Hack** — measure engagement as democracy, not consumption.  
- **Shared Epilogue: Why It All Matters** — connect personal maintenance to planetary continuity.

The antifascist home is not nostalgic — it’s *functional*.  
It’s the infrastructure of care that fascism always seeks to privatise or destroy.

*🪖 Home Front 2.0* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It translates antifascist theory into daily civic practice — where care, craft, and reading become strategic acts.
