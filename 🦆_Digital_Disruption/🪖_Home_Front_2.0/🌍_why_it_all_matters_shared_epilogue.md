# 🌍 Why It All Matters — Shared Epilogue

*Literacy, democracy, and antifascism — the civic continuity thread.*

---

Books are expensive now; for many families they’ve slipped from “treat” to “luxury.” That makes the library — and everything that happens inside it — one of the last free engines of literacy left.

And literacy doesn’t stop at reading. Every visit, skill-swap, and shared complaint teaches civic language: how systems work, how neighbours cooperate, how ideas move. You don’t have to do everything. Use what fits your life and your community.

Together, these small, lawful acts — borrowing, teaching, fixing, organising — recreate the social conditions that keep authoritarianism at bay. They make literacy contagious again: in reading, in dialogue, and in democracy itself.
