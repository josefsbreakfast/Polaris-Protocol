# 🏡 Domestic Infrastructure as Care System  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*The home as distributed civic infrastructure.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Reinterprets the household as a civic node — a place where care logistics, energy awareness, and repair practices intersect with democracy.  
When fascism privatises survival, every act of maintenance becomes a form of resistance.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- Home as micro-grid of resilience.  
- Shared tools, shared power, shared kitchen table.  
- Quiet logistics: laundry, light, bandwidth, and trust.

## 🌌 Constellations  
🪖 🏡 🌿 🐝 — Care, cooperation, resilience, civic autonomy.  

---

## ✨ Stardust  
domestic infrastructure, civic repair, antifascism, resilience, care systems, democracy at home
