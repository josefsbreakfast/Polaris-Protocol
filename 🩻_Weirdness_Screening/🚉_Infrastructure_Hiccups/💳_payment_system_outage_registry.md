# 💳 Payment System Outage Registry
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Financial rails: cards, ATMs, bank networks, merchant acquirers.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
A ledger of **payment rail disruptions**: card terminals down, PSP API faults, Faster Payments delays, ATM host timeouts.

---

## 🌱 Purpose
- Differentiate issuer, scheme, acquirer, and merchant failures.  
- Detect **geographic or temporal clustering** around civic flashpoints.  
- Build an evidence base with **auth IDs / RRN / STAN** where available.
