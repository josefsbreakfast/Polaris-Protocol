# 🚦 Transit Blackout Casebook
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Rail, bus, tram, metro — significant service suspensions aligned with public events.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
Structured case studies for **movement suppression via transit outages**: signal failures, control-room faults, gating anomalies.

---

## 🌱 Purpose
- Record **route-level** and **operator-level** disruptions with timing fidelity.  
- Correlate with protests, court dates, strikes, or high-profile investigations.

---

## 🧪 Minimal Record (YAML front-matter)
```yaml
when: 2025-11-02T09:15:00Z
operator: "Rail Operator / Transit Authority"
route_or_zone: "Line/Route or Zone"
symptom: "All services suspended — 'signalling fault'"
duration: "45m"
context: "Protest in city centre; platform gates locked"
artifacts: [station_board.jpg, app_status.png, announcement_audio.m4a]
notes: "Services resumed immediately after dispersal order"
tags: [transit_freeze, gating_lockdown]
```

> If possible, note **headway before outage** and **clear-down time** after resumption.
