# 📈 Infrastructure Sync Chart
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Overlay outages across domains to reveal synchrony.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
A correlation board: place **payment**, **transit**, **utility**, and **ATM** incidents on a shared timeline.

---

## 🌱 Purpose
- Reveal **co-timed** events otherwise missed in siloed logs.  
- Provide a single view for **press, regulators, and legal counsel**.

---

## ⏱️ Timeline Table
| date (UTC) | incident | node link | domain | geography | notes | public context |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-11-02 | Example: LINK partial outage | [💳](./💳_payment_system_outage_registry.md) | payments | Midlands |  | Charity march |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

> Optionally maintain a **control timeline** of typical maintenance windows.
