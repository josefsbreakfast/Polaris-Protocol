# 🧰 Field Kit — Infrastructure Logs
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Templates and tactics for reliable, shareable incident capture.*

## 🧭 Orientation
A practical kit for **in-situ documentation** when infrastructure stutters: what to record, ask, and preserve.

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist
- Timestamp **start/stop** and take wide + detail photos.  
- Capture **official notices** (apps, boards, printed signage).  
- Ask operators for **incident/defect IDs** where appropriate.  
- Note **what else** failed nearby (payments, lifts, turnstiles).  
- Cross-verify with **two independent sources** (strangers, local news, multiple apps).

## 🧪 Repro & Evidence Matrix

| time | exact start | last known good | exact end |  |
| geography | station/branch | postcode | lat/long |  |
| network | wifi | mobile data | wired |  |
| identity | signed-in | guest | offline |  |
| corroboration | staff statement | status page | third-party tracker |  |

## 📨 Escalation Templates (stubs)
- **Operator report** — request incident ID, root-cause category, impacted area.  
- **Regulator note** — snapshot of pattern with evidence bundle (e.g., ORR, PSR, Ofgem, Ofcom).  
- **Press pack** — neutral chronology with artifacts for verification.
