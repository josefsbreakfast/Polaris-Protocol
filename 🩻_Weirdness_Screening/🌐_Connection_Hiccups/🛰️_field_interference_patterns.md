*Sudden signal collapse linked to physical proximity or device clustering*

---

## Purpose  

Document short-range interference that coincides with uploads, calls, or recording attempts.  
Helps distinguish natural congestion from engineered suppression fields (e.g., jammers, spoofed access points, or deliberate spectrum flooding).

---

## What to Collect  

- Timestamp + duration of outage  
- Nearby devices (brand, type, mode: Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / 5G)  
- Exact action occurring at onset (upload, sync, call, etc.)  
- RSSI / signal graph if available  
- Environment description (room, building materials, shielding)

*Field Interference Patterns* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It tracks spatially-linked communication breakdowns to reveal proximity-based containment methods.
