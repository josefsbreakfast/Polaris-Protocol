# ⏱️ Timebase Desyncs  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Clock drift, timestamp mismatch, and latency distortion*

---

## Purpose  

Document moments where system clocks, video/audio timestamps, or sync markers slip unexpectedly.  
Helps identify temporal sabotage — subtle timing distortions that disrupt authentication, media evidence, or sequence-of-events reconstruction.

---

## What to Collect  

- Source and target device clocks before + after event  
- NTP / GPS sync status  
- File creation + modification times  
- Observable delay in uploads, calls, or live streams  
- System log excerpts showing drift or correction attempts

*Timebase Desyncs* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents manipulation of system clocks and timestamps as a covert containment vector.
