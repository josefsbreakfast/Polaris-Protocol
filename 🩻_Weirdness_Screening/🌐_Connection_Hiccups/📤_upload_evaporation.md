**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Uploads that stall near completion then reset without trace*

---

## Purpose  

Track vanishing file transfers — where progress bars reach 95–99 % before aborting.  
Captures a signature form of data containment aimed at preventing transmission of sensitive artefacts.

---

## Data to Record  

- Platform + file type  
- File size vs remaining percentage on stall  
- Error code or absence of error  
- Network metrics during stall  
- Whether retries yield identical failure point

*Upload Evaporation* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the disappearance of outbound data streams at the threshold of completion.
