**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Selective degradation of encrypted or peer-to-peer channels*

---

## Purpose  

Record instances where secure connections (VPN, TLS, Signal, Matrix, WebRTC) stall or re-route through unexpected hops.  
Focus on whether interruptions align with metadata-heavy transmissions or sensitive keywords.

---

## Indicators  

- Repeated TLS handshake timeouts  
- DNS resolution to non-standard IPs  
- Sudden fallback to unencrypted transport  
- Trace route divergence from baseline path  
- Correlated drops across different ISPs or devices

## ✨ Stardust  

protocol interference, TLS timeout, VPN drop, encryption downgrade, traceroute anomaly, metadata suppression

*Protocol Shadowing* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the subtle manipulation of secure channels and encrypted pathways.
