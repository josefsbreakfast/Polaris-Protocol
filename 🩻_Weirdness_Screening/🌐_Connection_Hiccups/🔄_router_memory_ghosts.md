# 🔄 Router Memory Ghosts  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Phantom SSIDs, duplicate MACs, and haunted network entries*

---

## Purpose  

Track anomalies appearing within routers, modems, and local network tables — such as ghost devices that connect briefly or false SSID echoes.  
Useful for distinguishing benign caching errors from spoofing or cloned hardware interference.

---

## Observation Checklist  

- Screenshot of router admin interface (MAC, SSID, hostname)  
- DHCP lease table before + after ghost entry  
- Device list vs physical inventory  
- Time window of appearance  
- Cross-reference with power or proximity logs

*Router Memory Ghosts* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records transient or duplicated device identities that reveal infrastructural hauntings at the network layer.
