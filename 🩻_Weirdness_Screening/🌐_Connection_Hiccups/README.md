*Wi-Fi drops, calls cut, uploads fail mid-transfer.*

## Purpose  

Capture intermittent connectivity issues and distinguish local glitches from coordinated interference.  
Patterns of repeated disconnection, jitter spikes, or service-specific cut-outs may indicate targeted throttling or synchronised network manipulation.

---

## What to Collect  

- **Timestamp:** ISO8601 (include timezone)  
- **Affected app/service & action:** e.g., “upload video to Drive”, “call on Signal cut at 04:12”  
- **Network type:** home Wi-Fi / mobile data / public network  
- **Signal/throughput:** RSSI, Mbps, ping, jitter (if known)  
- **Error message/code:** verbatim text + screenshot if possible  
- **Device / OS / app versions**  
- **Location:** coarse (city / venue)

---

## Analysis Pointers  

- Correlate timestamps with other anomalies (e.g., Access Barriers, Systematic Patterns).  
- Note any pattern of disconnections coinciding with upload or share actions involving sensitive content.  
- Use simple command-line or app-based tools to confirm objective network status (ping, traceroute).  
- Maintain a consistent log to determine whether events are random, infrastructural, or induced.

*Connection Hiccups* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records evidence of communication breakdowns in daily life — from mundane outages to patterned interference.
