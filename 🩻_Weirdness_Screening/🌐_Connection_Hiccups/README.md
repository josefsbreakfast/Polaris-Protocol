# 🌐 Connection Hiccups  
**First created:** 2025-09-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Connectivity collapse as a patterned interference field*

---

## Purpose  

This cluster investigates the **breakpoints of connection** — where data flow falters, sync fails, or calls die mid-sentence.  
Its goal is to distinguish between *ordinary noise* and *engineered silence*: to detect when “bad Wi-Fi” becomes a suppression surface.

Each subnode below refines a different layer of the failure stack — from radio interference to app-level vanishings.

## 🧩 Cluster Composition  

| Node | Focus | Diagnostic Layer |
|------|--------|------------------|
| [🛰️ Field Interference Patterns](./🛰️_Field_Interference_Patterns.md) | Local signal collapse linked to physical proximity | Physical / spatial |
| [📡 Protocol Shadowing](./📡_Protocol_Shadowing.md) | Degradation of encrypted or peer-to-peer channels | Network transport |
| [🔁 Handshake Loopbacks](./🔁_Handshake_Loopbacks.md) | Infinite reconnects, token expiry loops | Authentication |
| [📞 Ghost Call Drops](./📞_Ghost_Call_Drops.md) | Calls that terminate on key phrases | Linguistic / emotional |
| [📤 Upload Evaporation](./📤_Upload_Evaporation.md) | Uploads that vanish near completion | Data flow |
| [⏱️ Timebase Desyncs](./⏱️_Timebase_Desyncs.md) | Timestamp drift and temporal sabotage | Temporal / forensic |
| [🔄 Router Memory Ghosts](./🔄_Router_Memory_Ghosts.md) | Phantom SSIDs and cloned devices | Hardware / infrastructural |
| [🧩 Connectivity Mosaic](./🧩_Connectivity_Mosaic.md) | Aggregated visual map of all above | Integrative / analytic |

## Data Discipline  

When logging an event, capture:  
- **Timestamp** (ISO 8601 + timezone)  
- **App / service / action** (“upload to Drive”, “Signal call cut”)  
- **Network type** (Wi-Fi / mobile data / public)  
- **Signal metrics** (RSSI, Mbps, ping, jitter)  
- **Error text or code** (verbatim + screenshot)  
- **Device + OS + app version**  
- **Location** (coarse — city or venue)

Consistency across nodes allows cross-comparison and pattern synthesis in 🧩 _Connectivity Mosaic_.

## Analytical Cues  

- Correlate drops with sensitive uploads or witness material.  
- Compare with [🔑 Access Barriers](../🔑_Access_Barriers/) for authentication overlap.  
- Align timestamps with [🎛 Systematic Patterns](../🎛_Systematic_Patterns/) to test synchronisation.  
- Treat repetition as signal, not error.

*Connection Hiccups* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It anchors the network-interference constellation, tracing how everyday disconnections form a map of containment and resistance.
