*Aggregate diagnostic map combining multiple interference logs*

---

## Purpose  

Integrate field data from Connection Hiccups, Access Barriers, and Infrastructure Hiccups into a unified analytical chart.  
The goal is to visualise patterns across time, geography, and service type — distinguishing random failure from coordinated throttling.

---

## How to Build  

- Merge timestamped logs across nodes into a single CSV or spreadsheet  
- Plot frequency of disconnections per service  
- Cross-tab network type vs. app vs. time of day  
- Annotate notable peaks or synchronous events  
- Tag potential interference clusters for re-testing

*Connectivity Mosaic* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It synthesises interference data into visible patterns of suppression and recovery.
