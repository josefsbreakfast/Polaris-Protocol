## 🧭 Orientation
A living checklist for survivors encountering retail denial. Prioritise **evidence capture** and **safe alternates**.

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist
- Screenshot listing, cart, error (with timestamps visible).  
- Save page HTML/PDF if possible; copy error codes and correlation IDs.  
- Try alternates: variant SKU, different retailer, different network (mobile vs home), signed‑out vs signed‑in.  
- Record contextual factors (news, protests, policy dates).

- **Regulator note** — log pattern with evidence bundle (ICO/Trading Standards/PSR).
