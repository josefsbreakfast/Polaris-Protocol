# 📈 Service Blockage Timeline
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Overlay of retail anomalies with political and social events.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
A correlation canvas: place incidents from sibling logs on a shared timeline to see clustering around flashpoints.

---

## 🌱 Purpose
- Detect temporal alignments between blockages and public events.  
- Separate routine outages from strategic scarcity.

---

## ⏱️ Timeline Table (paste/expand)
| date (UTC) | incident | node link | category | notes | external context |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-11-02 | Example: tents unavailable across 3 retailers | [🧾](./🧾_phantom_stock_registry.md) | phantom stock |  | Protest policing bill vote |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

> Consider a second sheet for *non‑incidents* (expected success) to avoid survivorship bias.
