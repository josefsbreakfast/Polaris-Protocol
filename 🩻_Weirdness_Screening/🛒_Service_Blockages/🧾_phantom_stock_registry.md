# 🧾 Phantom Stock Registry
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*Inventory anomalies where items appear available but cannot be purchased.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation
A lightweight log for SKU-level anomalies that look like stock but behave like mirage. Use this registry to record, compare, and cluster incidents across vendors and time.

---

## 🌱 Purpose
- Track items that present as "in stock" yet fail at checkout or vanish on refresh.  
- Surface vendor- or category-level patterns suggestive of selective denial or controlled scarcity.

---

## 🧪 Minimal Record (YAML front‑matter)
```yaml
when: 2025-11-02T12:00:00Z
site: "RetailerX.com"
sku: "PRODUCTCODE-123"
symptom: "Shows in stock; checkout returns generic error"
error: "ERR_CHECKOUT_GENERIC"
artifacts: [listing.png, cart.png, error.png]
repro: {"vpn": true, "mobile": false}
notes: "Alternate color variant succeeds; EU region only fails"
tags: [phantom_stock, selective_unavailability]
```

---

## 🧾 Log Template (append rows below)
| when (UTC) | site | sku | region | symptom | error/code | step | artifacts | repro notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  | add-to-cart / checkout / payment |  |  |

> Tip: keep original URLs and note exact variant/size. Vendor A/B will often diverge by a single option.

---

## 🔬 Signals to Watch
- Same SKU purchasable in one region/account but not another.  
- Variant swap (size/color/ISBN) suddenly succeeds.  
- Denials that align with events (policy votes, protests, strikes).
