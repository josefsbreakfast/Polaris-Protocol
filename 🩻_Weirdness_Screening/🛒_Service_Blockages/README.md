*Consumer‑facing anomalies (shopping carts empty, items always “out of stock”)*

---

## Purpose
Track consumer‑facing anomalies that prevent completion of purchases or access to goods.

## What to collect

- Error text/codes, request IDs
- Alternative SKUs/retailers tested

...

## 🏮 Footer
*Service Blockages* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It tracks denial of consumer access as a suppression vector.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
