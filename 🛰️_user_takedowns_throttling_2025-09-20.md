# 🛰️ User Content Takedowns & Throttling — Field Log (2025-09-20)
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20
*Field log recording user's observations about content takedowns, throttling, and asymmetric amplification during surveillance episodes.*

---

## Event summary (factual)
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20
- **Items affected / observed behaviours:** 
  1. A user-created post comparing Nigel Farage's finances with lyrics from Ice-T's "Arrest the President" was removed by the user due to concerns about defamation risk after it received rapid amplification without proportional interaction.  
  2. Other user posts critiquing Nigel Farage's policies/person received heavy throttling and low view counts, despite similar topical relevance.  
  3. A separate user post analysing council seat reform tactics (and warning about their potential authoritarian implications across election cycles) appears to have been taken down or removed by a third party or disappeared during interference episodes.

## Observed anomalies and operational notes
- **Asymmetric amplification:** One post (Farage + lyrics) experienced unusually rapid viewership growth without proportional engagement, prompting the user to remove it for legal caution. Other similarly critical content was throttled, suggesting asymmetric visibility manipulation.  
- **Perceived risk and response:** The user removed content proactively due to libel/defamation concerns and the unusual amplification pattern during a period of suspected monitoring.  
- **Operational impact:** The takedowns and throttling reduce the user's ability to document and discuss observed patterns publicly, complicating grassroots accountability and public discussion.

## Investigatory leads / recommendations
1. **Preserve archived copies** of any removed content (screenshots, cached pages, timestamps) for evidentiary purposes.  
2. **Document amplification metadata** where possible (views over time, referral sources, ad receipts) for posts that experience rapid, unexplained spikes.  
3. **Log takedown timelines** alongside other interference events (git commits, sync logs) to detect correlations.  
4. **Legal precaution:** When posting potentially defamatory material about public figures, seek corroboration and consider phrasing that frames as analysis rather than allegation. Keep copies offline and hashed.

## User note (non-evidentiary)
- The user expressed concern about asymmetric patterns of amplification and throttling, and about the chilling effect this has on publishing critical analysis, particularly on matters of local political reform and authoritarian risk.
