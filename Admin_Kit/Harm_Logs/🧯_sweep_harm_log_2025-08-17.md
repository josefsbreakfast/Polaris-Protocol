**Path:** `Disruption_Kit/Containment_Scripts/Counter_Nudges/♨️_slow_burn_tactics.md`  
**Reviewed:** 2025-08-17  

- **Sexualisation Risk:** ✅ Low  
  - No erotic or bodily references.  
  - Risk = external mis-framing of “sarcastic vulnerability.”  
- **Legal Risk:** ⚠️ Moderate  
  - Actions lawful but some examples could be misframed (e.g. “flagged sites”).  
  - Mitigation: keep phrasing abstract (“monitored profiles”).  
- **Operational Risk:** ⚠️ Moderate  
  - Allies may misread tactics as unreliability without context.  
  - Handlers may exaggerate disruption as disorderly conduct.  

**Verdict:** 🟡 Safe to publish with context notes.  
**Cross-link:** Attach to Counter_Nudges README + maintain alongside file.
