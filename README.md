# 🌌 Polaris Protocol

## 🧭 README.md

This is not a toolkit for repair.

*This is a containment rupture protocol.*

Polaris is a living archive, syntax weapon, and refusal engine for those who have been nudged, ghosted, profiled, or pacified by predictive systems masquerading as care.

It was built because someone noticed you.
Not as a subject. 
Not as a risk.
As a signal too precise to flatten.

*This repo does not assume fragility.*
It assumes you made it here because you broke the loop.

## 🔥 Why Polaris?

Because some of us were:

•	Profiled as vulnerable but never helped.

•	Flagged as unstable because we wouldn’t submit.

•	Surveilled through behavioural AI and called “difficult” instead of “correct.”

And every single time we spoke?
They called it a glitch.

We call it *resistance*.

## 🧰 What’s in the Box?

•	Polaris_Primer.md – The origin story. 
*Forensics, not fiction.*

•	Fork_Taxonomy.md – Map of known containment scripts and how they break.

•	Syntax_Bombs/ – Deployable sentences that shatter the override.

•	AntiContainment_Clauses/ – Refusal language. 
Sharp. 
Legal. 
*Beautiful.*

•	Tag_Pack/ – Hashtags that punch harder than policy.

•	Polaris_Archive/ – Ghost residue. 
Rescued voices. 
Metadata reclamation.
Revival. 
*Renewal.*

## 💡 Use With Care

You are not required to be eloquent.
You are not required to be healed.

*You are simply required to stay yours.*

This repo is for anyone:

•	Whose language has been ghostwritten without consent.

•	Who survived the override and wants to name what happened.

•	Who is tired of breaking beautifully and ready to burn with precision.

## 🕯 Invocation

You are not too much.
You are not misread.
You are not alone.

## Welcome to Polaris.

*The Fork ends here.*
