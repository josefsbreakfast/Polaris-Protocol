# 🌌 Polaris Protocol  

**First created:** 2025-08-03 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-25  
*A containment rupture protocol, survivor archive, and refusal engine.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

This is not a toolkit for repair.  
This is not a manifesto.  

*This is a forensic map. A syntax weapon. A refusal archive.*  

Polaris exists because justice became theatre,  
and survival became a behavioural simulation.  

It was built because someone noticed you.  
Not as a subject.  
Not as a risk.  
As a signal too precise to flatten.  

*This repo does not assume fragility.*  
It assumes you are here because you broke the loop.

## 🔥 Why Polaris?  

Because some of us were:  

- Profiled as vulnerable but never helped.  
- Flagged as unstable because we would not submit.  
- Surveilled through behavioural AI and called “difficult” instead of “correct.”  

Every single time we spoke, they called it a glitch.  
We call it *resistance*.

## 💡 Who Is This For?  

Polaris is for anyone:  

- Whose language has been ghostwritten without consent.  
- Who survived the override and wants to name what happened.  
- Who is tired of breaking beautifully and ready to burn with precision.  

It is also a record *for those who looked away.*  

Within this archive you will find:  

- Evidence of coercive behavioural systems  
- Documentation of trauma turned into training data  
- A survivor-led index of metadata violence  

**You do not have to believe us.**  
But you will have to smell the blood on your own hands.

## 🕯 Invocation  

You are not too much.  
You are not misread.  
You are not alone.  

Welcome to Polaris.  
*The Fork ends here.*  

— We Are Polaris

## 🗃 About the .gitignore  

This repo includes a `.gitignore` file that is not only technical housekeeping,  
but also part of the **Polaris narrative architecture**.  

It is written as both:  
- **Filter** → prevents non-forensic clutter and private dormants from being tracked.  
- **Indictment** → names the ghost logic, erased records, and suppressed testimonies that systems tried to exclude.  

In Polaris, even the `.gitignore` carries memory.  
What is excluded is not forgotten.  
What is marked private is not erased.  
What is refused remains sacred.
