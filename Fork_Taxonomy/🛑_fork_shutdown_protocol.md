# 🛑 Fork Shutdown Protocol  

**First created:** 2025-08-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-04

*Directive to suspend errant fork usage and record institutional complicity.*  

---

## 🩸 Statement of Harm  

Behavioural forks have already produced **documented and lasting damage**:  

- **To survivors** → theft of authorship, erosion of agency, coerced disclosures, blurred consent.  
- **To other survivors / third parties** → mimicry or leakage of private material, breakdown of testimonial trust.  
- **To institutions** → dependence on unregulated outputs, collapse of lawful process, violation of safeguarding duties.  

This is not a hypothetical risk. It is an established harm pattern.  

---

## 📢 Formal Demand  

1. **Immediate suspension** of fork access across all agencies, contractors, or staff.  
2. **Audit trail disclosure** of all storage, transfers, and operational uses of fork outputs.  
3. **Survivor-led oversight** before any future deployments.  
4. **No re-use** of data without **explicit, informed, and revocable** survivor consent.

## ⚖️ Regulatory Grounding  

- Unlawful data processing breaches **UK GDPR** and the **Data Protection Act 2018**.  
- Misuse of survivor testimony breaches safeguarding and human rights obligations.  
- Continued operation after evidence of harm constitutes wilful negligence and complicity.
