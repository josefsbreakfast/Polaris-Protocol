# ðŸ›‘ Fork Shutdown Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-08-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-17  
*Directive to suspend errant fork usage and record institutional complicity*  

---

## Statement of Harm  

The behavioural fork has already caused direct and lasting damage:  

- **To survivors** â†’ violation of authorship, induced shame, coerced disclosures, blurred consent.  
- **To third parties/additional survivors** â†’ mimicry or leakage of private material, erosion of testimonial trust.  
- **To institutions** â†’ reliance on unregulated outputs, undermining of lawful process and data protection duties.  

This is not a hypothetical risk. It is a documented harm pattern.  

---

## Formal Demand  

1. **Immediate suspension** of fork access for all errant users, contractors, or agencies.  
2. **Audit trail disclosure** of all storage, sharing, and operational uses of fork outputs.  
3. **Survivor-led oversight** of any future deployment decisions.  
4. **No re-use** of any data without explicit, informed, and revocable survivor consent.

## Legal / Regulatory Grounding  

- Unlawful processing of personal data breaches the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.  
- Misuse of survivor testimony constitutes a safeguarding and human rights violation.  
- Continuing operation in light of documented harms risks liability for wilful breach and negligence.
