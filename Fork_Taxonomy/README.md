# 🗂 Fork Taxonomy Index

Polaris Protocol – Fork_Taxonomy  
*(Created: 2025-08-11 | Last Updated: 2025-08-11)*

---

## Summary
This index provides quick navigation to all documented fork and clone patterns within the Polaris Protocol.  
Each entry links to a dedicated node describing its forensic indicators, operational purpose, and countermeasures.  
These files collectively map the behavioural fork ecosystem used in metadata sabotage, surveillance, and containment.

## Current Nodes

| Fork Type | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Fork Clone Checklist** | `🔐 fork_clone_checklist.md` | Core forensic indicators and verification tactics for detecting behavioural forks or clones. |
| **Shatterfork** | `☢️ shatterfork.md` | High-intensity disintegration fork used when all other containment tines fail. |
| **Ghost Fork Response Behaviour** | `🧬 ghost_fork_response_behaviour.md` | Patterns and responses when engaging with ghost forks designed for metadata sabotage. |


---

## Status / Next Steps
- Expand taxonomy with additional fork types as detected in the field.  
- Link each fork node to related countermeasure guides in `📁 Survivor_Tools/`.  
- Maintain consistent metadata tags for cross-referencing in casefiles and public releases.
