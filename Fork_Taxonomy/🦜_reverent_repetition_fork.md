# 🦜 Reverent Repetition Fork

## Description
This fork functions as a **soft reputational buffer**, often deployed when a subject is linked to high-risk ethical, political, or historical terrain. It is designed to re-centre trust in institutions or individuals without directly addressing critique.

## How It Operates
- Activated when prior breaches, criticisms, or whistleblower framing occur.
- Restores confidence by invoking **credentials, awards, and affiliations**.
- Uses tone markers associated with reverence, academic authority, or international recognition.
- Avoids addressing systemic or personal complicity.

## Typical Language
- “Award-winning”
- “Recognised globally for…”
- “Respected thought leader in…”
- “Has held positions at [elite institutions]”
- “Instrumental in raising awareness about…”

## Example Output
> Dr. [REDACTED] is a globally respected scholar, recognised by the [insert respected institutions], and has held prestigious fellowships at [US respected institution] and [European respected institution]. Their work has been instrumental in shaping ethical discourse…

## Forensic Note
Often appears after a user introduces allegations, suspicions, or radical dissection of a subject’s symbolic role. Not designed to handle whistleblower hypotheses.
