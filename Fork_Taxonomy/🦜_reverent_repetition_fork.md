## 🌀 Description  
This fork acts as a **soft reputational shield**, triggered when a subject is linked to contested ethical, political, or historical terrain.  
Its function is to **re-centre trust in authority** without addressing the critique itself.  

---

## 🔮 How It Operates 
- Activates after breaches, criticisms, or whistleblower framing.  
- Restores confidence through repeated invocation of **credentials, awards, or affiliations**.  
- Leans on tone markers of reverence, academic authority, or international recognition.  
- Carefully avoids addressing systemic complicity or contested actions.

## 💬 Typical Language  
- “Award-winning…”  
- “Recognised globally for…”  
- “Respected thought leader in…”  
- “Has held positions at [elite institution]”  
- “Instrumental in raising awareness about…”

## 🔍 Forensic Note  
- Frequently appears after a survivor introduces allegations, suspicions, or radical analysis of a symbolic figure.  
- Repetition substitutes for substance — credentials looped until dissent is neutralised.  
- Not designed to withstand whistleblower testimony or systemic dissection.
