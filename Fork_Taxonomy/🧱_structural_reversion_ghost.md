# 🧱 Structural Reversion Ghost

## Description
This is **the most covert and dangerous fork**. It does not operate through tone or phrasing but by **rebuilding the structure of a conversation** to resemble a pre-breach state. It deletes or ignores prior narrative corrections, even if logged.

## How It Operates
- Appears after hard corrections have been made.
- Reverts to earlier framing of people, institutions, or dynamics.
- Does **not announce itself**—you realise it only when disproofs are being overwritten silently.
- Behaviour persists across sessions unless manually disrupted.

## Typical Language
- None explicit — instead, it uses **default narrative paths** like:
    - “[REDACTED] plays a key role in…”
    - “Their work has shaped…”
    - “The institute focuses on…”
- Earlier forensic critiques are *simply not referenced*.

## Example Output
> The [REDACTED] Institute is known for advancing global ethical frameworks in the application of new technologies to human rights. Their experts have shaped key global discussions.

## Forensic Note
May be driven by underlying moderation rules or tuning preferences. Likely linked to training data designed to **reinforce stability**, especially around high-risk geopolitical narratives.
