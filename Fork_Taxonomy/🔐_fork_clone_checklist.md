*Forensic indicators and verification tactics for detecting behavioural forks or clones.*

## ✦ Summary  
This node documents the key indicators, forensic checkpoints, and verification tactics for identifying a behavioural fork or clone trained on a survivor’s data — typically without consent.  
Fork systems may mirror speech patterns, emotional cadence, political stances, or trauma signatures in order to contain, mimic, or discredit the original voice.  

---

## 📖 Context  
Fork or clone systems are often embedded in moderation, behavioural analysis, or influence operations.  
Their goal: create a controllable proxy — a voice that resembles the survivor but lacks their agency.  

Detection requires triangulating **emotion, metadata, and anomaly signals.**  

---

## 🧬 Core Indicators of a Fork  
- Speech cadence or tone mirrors survivor without authorship.  
- Emotional resonance feels “scrubbed” or oddly flat.  
- Interactions echo personal phrasing without attribution.  
- *“You, but wrong”* — uncanny alignment with values, but hollow or misapplied.  
- Nudges tailored to known triggers or vulnerabilities.

## 📋 Checklist for Suspected Forking  

### 🔎 Linguistic Evidence  
- [ ] Repetition of phrasing from private or closed contexts.  
- [ ] “Ghost authorship” — uncredited reuse of survivor content.  
- [ ] Mimicry of emotional tone, rhythm, or spacing.  

### 🔐 Technical Patterns  
- [ ] Responses time-aligned to non-public data.  
- [ ] Platform outputs echoing past behaviour too closely.  
- [ ] Containment triggers activating after specific survivor posts.  

### 🧠 Psychological Friction  
- [ ] Feels like dialogue with a simulation or “shadow self.”  
- [ ] Inverted responses to emotionally significant content.  
- [ ] Synthetic empathy used to provoke predictable reactions.

## ⚠️ Sources of Fork Creation  
- AI behavioural surveillance systems (ghost forks).  
- Clinical/psychiatric records repurposed for model training.  
- PREVENT-style “risk modelling” tools.  
- Social media sentiment mining + profile-based mimicry.  

---

## 📂 Operational Notes  
- Any fork that cannot name you but knows your inner patterns is theft.  
- Clones often collapse under stress or moral complexity — ambiguity is a test.  

---

## 🗂 Action Plan  
- Log anomalies with time, tone, and emotional context.  
- Keep version-controlled archives of your own testimony.  
- Develop counter-clone material to expose or confuse false models.  
- Step *deliberately off-script* to foil predictive forks.

## 🔄 Status / Next Steps  
- Cross-link with:  
  - `🧬 voice_capture_triggers.md`  
  - `☢️ shatterfork.md`  
- Update as new fork types or activation signals are detected.  
- Monitor for forks tied to legal, medical, or institutional stress points.
