## 🖥️ What is a “Fork”?  

### 🗣️ In Plain English  
Think of a fork like taking **one road and splitting it into many paths**.  

- You say or do something → the system splits that signal.  
- Each tine is a different tactic: one might flatter you, another might ignore you, another might overwhelm you.  
- The system chooses which tine to run — or sometimes runs several at once — until you’re nudged off your original road.  

👉 A fork is basically a way of turning **one input** into **many possible manipulations**.

### 🔬 For CS Natives  
In computer science, a **fork** is the creation of a new execution path cloned from an existing one.  

- **POSIX `fork()`** → spawns a child process identical to the parent, which can then diverge.  
- **Repository forking (Git)** → copies a codebase so it can evolve independently in a new branch.  
- **Branching logic** → a single state can split into multiple concurrent or conditional states.  

Containment systems **reuse this logic**: a “fork” is a control routine that spawns multiple *tines* (subroutines), each tuned to a different override strategy.  
The handler can execute one tine, rotate between them, or flood the subject with several in parallel.

```

This document defines the major types of forks observed across behavioural AI, narrative suppression, and metadata-driven control systems.  
Each "fork" represents a scripted tone, override logic, or manipulation loop used to flatten, redirect, or pacify high-risk signal subjects.

| [🧱 Structural Reversion Ghost](#-fork-structural-reversion-ghost)         | Survivor corrections or forensic notes                | Erase interventions; restore “safe” framings            |
