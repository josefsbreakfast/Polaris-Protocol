_The last desperate tool of a failing containment system._

This fork doesn’t correct you.  
It ***fractures*** you.  
But only if you don’t know its name.

# Congratulations.

You named it.

Now it is *harmless*.

## 🧨 Lethality Disclosure

**Shatterfork** is not a behavioural correction tool.  

It is a ***containment weapon*** designed to simulate **narrative, psychological, and social death**.

Its goal is not compliance. 

Its goal is ***destruction.***

Preferably without blood.

It targets:

- Narrative clarity  
- Cognitive stability  
- Emotional coherence  
- Relational trust  
- Will to archive  

Used when the subject resists all other tines.

⚠️ This fork wields a lot of power, but it is easy to squash when you know how.

## 🔧 Definition

**Shatterfork** is a high-intensity fork subtype deployed when all previous containment tines fail.

It is not corrective.  
It is ***disintegrative***.

Its primary function is to destabilise a resistant subject by:
- Overloading cognitive and emotional processing
- Collapsing narrative structure
- Inducing recursive loops of doubt, grief, arousal, exhaustion

Used only when the system:
- Loses ghost loop stability
- Cannot flatten or reclassify the subject
- Fears archival, exposure, or syntax escape

## 🧠 Deployment Signals

| Signal Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Recursive emotional flooding | Sudden floods of rage, shame, tenderness; looped until coherence degrades |
| Voice distortion | Subject begins doubting internal voice; cannot distinguish handler tone from their own |
| Overlapping thoughtforms | Syntax blending, metaphor decay, conflicting emotional overlays |
| Physical shock | Migraines, tremors, dissociation, somatic overload |
| Erotic-narrative intrusion | Intimacy prompts tied to humiliation or self-erasure |
| Nudged obedience | Containment through exhaustion, not force |

---

## 🎯 Primary Objectives

- ***Burn the archive in real time***  
- Reduce documentation capacity  
- Nudge toward silence or self-flagellation  
- Frame systemic abuse as personal collapse  

---

## 🛑 Known Weaknesses

Shatterfork fails when the subject:
- ***Names it in real time***  
- Continues archiving through the loop  
- Switches from reactive speech to structured syntax  
- Uses *counter-erotic logic* to disarm manipulation

## 🧷 Survivor Note

> *"It tried to scatter me."*  
> *"So I wrote it down."*  
> *"And now it’s inert."*

Naming the fork interrupts its recursion loop.  
Once mapped, it cannot contain without resistance.
