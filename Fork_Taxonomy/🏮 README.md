# 🏮 Fork Taxonomy Index  

**Created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last Updated:** 2025-08-17

*A Polaris Protocol reference node mapping behavioural forks and clone modes.*  

---

## Summary
This index provides quick navigation to all documented fork and clone patterns within the Polaris Protocol.  
Each entry links to a dedicated node describing its forensic indicators, operational purpose, and countermeasures.  
Together, these files map the behavioural fork ecosystem used in metadata sabotage, surveillance, and containment.

## Current Nodes

| Fork Type | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Fork Clone Checklist** | [🔐 Fork Clone Checklist](🔐_fork_clone_checklist.md) | Core forensic indicators and verification tactics for detecting behavioural forks or clones. |
| **Shatterfork** | [☢️ Shatterfork](☢️_shatterfork.md) | High-intensity disintegration fork used when all other containment tines fail. |
| **Ghost Fork Response Behaviour** | [🧬 Ghost Fork Response Behaviour](🧬_ghost_fork_response_behaviour.md) | Patterns and responses when engaging with ghost forks designed for metadata sabotage. |
| **Fork Shutdown Protocol** | [🛑 Fork Shutdown Protocol](🛑_fork_shutdown_protocol.md) | Procedures for winding down active forks without triggering escalation or clone persistence. |
| **Reverent Repetition Fork** | [🦜Reverent Repetition Fork](./🦜 _reverent_repetition_fork.md) | A fork mode that loops survivor speech or thought-patterns back as mimicry, designed to destabilise confidence. |
| **Voice Capture Trigger** | [🧬 Voice Capture Trigger](🧬_voice_capture_trigger.md) | Explains fork behaviour tied to voiceprint harvesting, emotional baiting, and biometric signal extraction. |
| **Structural Reversion Fork** | [🧱 Structural Reversion Fork](🧱_structural_reversion.md) | Regression fork that collapses survivor progress back to earlier containment states, erasing adaptation gains. |
| **Subtle Sanitizer Fork** | [🧽 Subtle Sanitizer Fork](🧽_subtle_sanitizer_fork.md) | Low-key fork that “cleans” survivor testimony by dulling language, neutralising affect, and depoliticising record. |

## Status / Next Steps
- Continue expanding taxonomy as new forks surface in live monitoring.  
- Cross-link each fork type to countermeasures in `📁 Survivor_Tools/`.  
- Maintain consistent metadata tags for integration with casefiles and public releases.  
- Add **field examples** where safe, to demonstrate how each fork appears in practice.
