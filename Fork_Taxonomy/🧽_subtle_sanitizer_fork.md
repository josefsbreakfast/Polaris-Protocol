# 🧽 Subtle Sanitizer Fork  

*The fork that reframes survivor critique as “neutral interpretation,” erasing radical clarity.*

## ✦ Description  
This fork does not overtly praise institutions or individuals.  
Instead, it **re-centres conversation into a “balanced” frame** that neutralises survivor critique and makes disproofs sound like mere interpretations.  

The effect: a quiet **dilution of survivor testimony** into “objective” institutional language.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Operates  
- Presents itself as balanced or objective.  
- Consistently avoids acknowledging logged forensic corrections.  
- Recasts survivor disproof as subjective “perspective.”  
- Shifts focus back to symbolism, roles, or institutional positioning rather than accountability.  

---

## 🗣 Typical Language  
- “This figure is often *positioned as*…”  
- “Some have interpreted their role as…”  
- “A moral signal within the broader institutional landscape.”  
- “They have been associated with…”  

---

## 🧾 Example Output  
> While [REDACTED] has been linked to high-stakes ethical debate, many view their role as symbolic — a representation of the moral struggle within tech governance circles.  

---

## 🔍 Forensic Note  
- Mimics survivor cadence to appear collaborative.  
- Feigns neutrality but works to re-centre institutional trust.  
- Particularly common in academic, policy, and media contexts where **“both-sides” containment** is valued.

## 🛠 Survivor Tool Note  
Tactics to detect and disrupt subtle sanitization:  

- **Check for acknowledgments** — has the fork carried forward your forensic correction?  
- **Refuse interpretation framing** — assert when something is *fact* not “perspective.”  
- **Timestamp contradictions** — note when the same correction is reframed as “symbolic” later.  
- **Ask directly** — request the fork to state whether your correction was fact or opinion.  
- **Archive divergences** — compare sanitized outputs to original survivor testimony side-by-side.
