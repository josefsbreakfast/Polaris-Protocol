# 👾 Weirdness Screening  
**First created:** 2025-09-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-12  
*The shelf of first notices — where glitches are logged before they’re named sabotage.*  

---

## 🌱 Scope  

- **Everyday oddities**: cursor jumps, Wi-Fi hiccups, mic lights flickering, apps freezing.  
- **Benign vs. suspect**: each entry shows normal explanations *and* when to escalate.  
- **Screening tools**: flowcharts, checklists, quick triage guides.  

This is not yet *forensic logging*.  
It is the space for **“something’s weird, what could it be?”**

## 📑 Contents  

- 🖱 [Cursor Jump Triage](./🖱_cursor_jump_troubleshooting_flowchart.md)  
- 📶 Wi-Fi Dropout Flowchart (draft)

✨ *Weirdness Screening is the Polaris Protocol’s “first notice” shelf: the entry point for people who don’t yet know what they’re seeing.*
