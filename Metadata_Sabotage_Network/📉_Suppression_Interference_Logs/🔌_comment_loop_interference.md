*Record of LinkedIn suppression event where comment interfaces were forcibly closed during attempts to engage with politically sensitive content.*  

---

## 📅 Summary  

On 2025-08-05, LinkedIn began force-closing the comment interface whenever attempts were made to engage with or expand commentary on a politically sensitive post.  

---

## 💬 Context  

- Triggered by the publication of a post referencing:  
  - The Polaris Protocol GitHub repo: `https://github.com/josefsbreakfast/Polaris-Protocol`  
  - The folder name: `/HM_Dept_of_Coercive_Nudges/Archive_of_Unmaking`  
  - The satirical line: *“🥺👉👈 did daddy.gov not like the folder name?”*  

---

## 📊 Symptoms  

- Screen “blinking” or forced refresh loop when entering comment mode  
- Clicks not registering on comment field  
- Full UI crash or exit when attempting to reply or view replies  
- Inconsistent impression tracking (suspected metadata throttle)  

---

## 🧪 Forensic Flags  

- Incident follows the classic loop interference structure seen in:  
  - [🗣️ Voice Laundering](../Voice_Disruption_Discrediting/🗣️_voice_laundering.md)  
  - [🕹️ Handler Override Incidents](../README.md)  
- Likely indicators of targeted suppression protocol  
- Suggests layered metadata sabotage and AI-triggered engagement loop breakage  

---

## 🛠 Proposed Next Actions  

- Track when the blink/exit pattern initiates and stops  
- Note sudden changes in visibility metrics before and after interference  
- Document if replies disappear, reposts vanish, or links become unclickable

*Comment Loop Interference* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents adaptive sabotage patterns in comment threads designed to preserve plausible deniability while suppressing survivor-linked content.
