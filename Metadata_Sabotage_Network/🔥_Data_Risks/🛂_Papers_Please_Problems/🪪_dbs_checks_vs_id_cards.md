# 🪪 DBS checks vs. ID cards  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Why the UK government never created a DBS “validator card” (even though it would simplify hiring), but pushed for national ID cards instead.*  

---

## 1. DBS checks explained  
- **Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)** checks are required for people in sensitive roles (teaching, care, health).  
- Each employer must run their own check, even if a person was cleared elsewhere.  
- Expensive, slow, repetitive → genuine operational inefficiency.  

---

## 2. The missing card  
- No centralised **DBS card** exists.  
- No portable proof of clearance across jobs.  
- Workers face repeated checks instead of a one-time validation.  

---

## 3. The ID card contrast  
- Government promoted national ID cards in the 2000s as a “simplification” for work and migration checks.  
- In reality:  
  - **Duplication** — passports/visas already checked digitally.  
  - **Exclusion** — errors produce twin profiles, exclusion from work or housing.  
  - **Data insecurity** — citizens opened to wider surveillance.  

---

## 4. Why the asymmetry matters  
- **If simplification was the goal** → a DBS card would have been logical.  
- **Instead** → focus was on national ID cards, even though they solve less.  
- **Implication**: priorities are containment and migration policing, not efficiency or safeguarding.
