# 🛂 Papers Please Problems  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Folder for documenting how identity systems create cascading paperwork difficulties — the “papers please” effects across work, policing, and migration.*  

---

## Purpose  
Identity systems rarely fail in isolation. They generate **knock-on frictions** where a mismatch or missing entry in one system blocks access to others:  
- Work checks (employment, benefits, banking).  
- Residency checks (housing, welfare, healthcare).  
- Policing checks (stop & search, facial recognition, enforcement bias).  

This subfolder collects nodes showing how “papers please” problems manifest for different groups and through different myths.
