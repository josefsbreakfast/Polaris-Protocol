# 🛂 Papers Please Problems  
**First created:** 2025-09-26  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Every ID check is a memory test the state expects you to fail.*

## ✨ Purpose  

**Papers Please Problems** investigates how identity and verification systems transform ordinary paperwork into **surveillance theatre**.  
What begins as “proof of eligibility” becomes an endless cycle of checking, mismatching, and re-submission — a bureaucratic ritual that trains people to prove their existence on command.  

These frictions are not design flaws.  
They are a form of **administrative control** that quietly extends the border into everyday life — workplaces, hospitals, schools, and streets.  
By documenting these feedback loops, Polaris shows how data systems produce obedience through exhaustion.

### 👾 Case Study Cluster  

| File | Focus |  
|------|--------|  
| [💳 Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) Risks](./💳_biometric_residence_permits_risks.md) | How Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) reproduce discrimination and exclusion. |  
| [🚪 ID Admin Lock-Outs](./🚪_id_admin_lockouts.md) | Administrative lockouts: how ID dependencies create circular denials and slow exclusion. |

Each cluster exposes a different face of the same problem —  
that the ID system’s promise of certainty depends on **keeping people in suspense**.

*Papers Please Problems* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol.**  
It exposes how verification infrastructures transform from systems of proof  
into architectures of suspicion that never let subjects go.
