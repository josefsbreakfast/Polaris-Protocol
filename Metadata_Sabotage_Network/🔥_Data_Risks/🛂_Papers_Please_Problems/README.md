*Every ID check is a memory test the state expects you to fail*

## ✨ Purpose  

**Papers Please Problems** investigates how identity and verification systems transform ordinary paperwork into surveillance theatre.  
What begins as “proof of eligibility” becomes an endless cycle of checking, mismatching, and re-submission — a bureaucratic ritual that trains people to prove their existence on command.  

This folder matters because these frictions are not design flaws.  
They are a form of **administrative control** that quietly extends the border into everyday life — workplaces, hospitals, schools, and streets.  
By documenting these feedback loops, Polaris shows how data systems produce obedience through exhaustion.
