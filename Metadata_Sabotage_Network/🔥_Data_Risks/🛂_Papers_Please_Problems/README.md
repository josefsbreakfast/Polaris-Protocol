# 🛂 Papers Please Problems  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Subfolder for documenting how identity systems generate cascading paperwork difficulties — “papers please” barriers for UK citizens, EU nationals, and overseas passport holders.*  

---

## Purpose  
Digital ID and registry systems create **knock-on failures**. A mismatch in one system (biometrics, ID cards, visas) blocks access to others (benefits, residency, work, banking). These are “papers please” problems — where every interaction becomes conditional on perfect bureaucratic alignment.  

This subfolder tracks **three outcome groups**:  
- **🇬🇧 UK passport holders** — errors spill into welfare, services, and travel.  
- **🇪🇺 EU passport holders** — Brexit-era mismatches erode rights, twin profiles across UK/EU databases.  
- **🌍 Overseas passport holders** — migrants, students, and asylum seekers face compounded visa checks, biometric duplication, and shadow registers.
