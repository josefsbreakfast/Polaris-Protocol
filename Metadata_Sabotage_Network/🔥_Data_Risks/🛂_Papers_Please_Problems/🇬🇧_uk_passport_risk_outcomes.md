# 🇬🇧 UK passport risk outcomes  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Risks and failures for British passport holders when identity systems create “papers please” problems.*  

---

## 1. Core risks  
- **False positives** — lawful citizens flagged as suspicious due to twin profiles or biometric mismatches.  
- **Benefit exclusion** — errors in ID registers cascade into DWP/HMRC systems, blocking access to welfare or pensions.  
- **Travel disruption** — mismatches at border systems, delays or denial of entry.  
- **Banking & work checks** — identity errors prevent access to jobs or financial services.

## 2. Case patterns  
- ID card pilots risked embedding duplicate records.  
- Passport renewals sometimes blocked by unresolved NIR traces.  
- Post-2010: citizens still impacted by shadow data long after repeal.
