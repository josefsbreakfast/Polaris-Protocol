# 🛠️ Work Check Duplication  
**First created:** 2025-09-26  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Analysis of how mandatory ID cards would duplicate existing “Right to Work” systems, adding cost and risk without simplifying operations.*  

---

## ✨ 1. Current System  
Employers already conduct **Right to Work (RtW)** checks using Home Office–approved software.  
This framework validates passports, visas, and Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) through a central API.  
It is expensive, bureaucratic, and technically mature — meaning that adding another proof system would create redundancy, not reform.  

---

## 🛰️ 2. Duplication Problem  
- ID cards would require validation against the **same Home Office databases** used by RtW systems.  
- Employers would face **two verification chains** for the same individuals.  
- Parallel credentials mean **more data collection**, not simplification.  
- Each additional scan increases the risk of **twin profiles** and contradictory status results.  
- Administrative time and compliance cost multiply without improving accuracy.  

The result: **a double bureaucracy** masquerading as modernisation.  

---

## 🍊 3. Why “Simplification” Is False  
- An ID card cannot replace passports, visas, or BRPs — it merely adds another step.  
- Employers and universities would still need to verify underlying immigration documents.  
- Citizens bear **new renewal fees** and **biometric recapture costs** while receiving no added benefit.  
- The “efficiency” argument hides a transfer of administrative load from state to citizen.  

In practice, mandatory ID cards would **entrench**, not streamline, employer surveillance obligations.

## 🌍 4. Comparative Landscape  

| Jurisdiction / System | Operational Overlap | Lessons for UK |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **🇫🇷 France – Carte de Séjour & RtW Check** | Employers still verify both card and permit. | Dual verification increases friction and discrimination. |
| **🇩🇪 Germany – Aufenthaltstitel** | Integrated in visa/residence cards; employers verify online and manually. | Centralisation works only when state absorbs liability for error. |
| **🇪🇺 EU – EUDI Wallet Pilot** | Plans to unify proof-of-status and employment eligibility. | Potential model, but rollout incomplete and excludes third-country nationals. |
| **🇺🇸 United States – E-Verify System** | Uses I-9 form + digital check; false positives persist. | Shows automation does not remove human bias or cost. |

Across models, “simplification” consistently means **duplicating existing proofs** under new branding.

## 💶 5. Feasibility and Cost Outlook  

### 🧮 System Overlap Analysis  
- The UK RtW platform already consumes £30–40 million annually in software licensing and audit compliance.  
- Adding ID card integration would double that expenditure while creating duplicate status stores.  
- True efficiency gains could only come from **schema unification**, not parallel credentialing.  

### 💰 Estimated Cost Band (2025 – 2030)  

| Measure | Estimated cost band | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **ID Card Integration Layer** | £35 – 50 million | New API + data alignment with BRP and visa systems. |
| **Employer Software Rebuild** | £25 – 30 million | Retraining, certification, and dual validation support. |
| **Annual Maintenance & Compliance Audits** | £10 – 15 million | Ongoing vendor contracts and data oversight. |

Projected cost: **£70 – 95 million**,  
with **no net reduction** in administrative workload or error rates.

*Work Check Duplication* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It shows how the proposed ID card system would replicate existing Right to Work infrastructure,  
expanding cost and complexity while deepening surveillance of both employers and workers.
