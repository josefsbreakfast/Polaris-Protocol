# 🛠️ Work check duplication  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Analysis of how mandatory ID cards would duplicate existing “Right to Work” systems, adding cost and risk without simplifying operations.*  

---

## 1. Current system  
- Employers already perform **Right to Work checks**.  
- Uses Home Office–approved software to scan passports, visas, and biometric residence permits (BRPs).  
- Centralised, costly, but already functional.  

---

## 2. Duplication problem  
- ID cards would require scanning/validation against the same Home Office databases.  
- Parallel document types = **more complexity**, not less.  
- Mismatches generate **twin profiles**, creating exclusion risks.  

---

## 3. Why simplification is false  
- Operationally, an ID card does not replace passports or visas.  
- Employers would face multiple overlapping checks.  
- Citizens carry additional costs (fees, renewals) without benefit.
