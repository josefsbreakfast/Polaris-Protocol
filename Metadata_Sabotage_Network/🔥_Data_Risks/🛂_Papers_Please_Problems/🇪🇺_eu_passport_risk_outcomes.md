# 🇪🇺 EU passport risk outcomes  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Risks and failures for EU nationals in the UK when identity systems create “papers please” problems.*  

---

## 1. Core risks  
- **Brexit mismatch** — EU citizens’ settled/pre-settled status not aligning with UK identity records.  
- **Twin profiles** — duplicate entries across EU and UK databases.  
- **Service exclusion** — NHS, banking, or work checks failing due to data gaps.  
- **Border uncertainty** — Schengen–UK border crossings complicated by overlapping digital systems.  

---

## 2. Case patterns  
- Settled status system (2019–2025) created uncertainty and exclusions.  
- EU nationals denied housing or work when digital checks failed.  
- Parallel biometrics (UK vs EU) left people with shadow records.
