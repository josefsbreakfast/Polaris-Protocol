*Risks and failures for migrants, students, and overseas passport holders when identity systems create “papers please” problems.*  

---

## 1. Core risks  
- **Visa over-checking** — multiple document checks due to duplicate or mismatched records.  
- **Containment via shadow registers** — migrant data retained even when visas expire.  
- **Asylum vulnerability** — biometric duplication creates barriers to claims.  
- **Exclusion from services** — lawful residents blocked from healthcare, housing, or work.  

---

## 2. Case patterns  
- Biometric residence permits (BRPs) linked to ID card infrastructure, even after repeal.  
- Students and workers caught in mismatches between Home Office and universities/employers.  
- Contractors retaining biometric samples beyond official timelines.
