*How bureaucratic errors or delays in ID systems lock people out of essential services.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
- Incorrect data, mismatched records, or lost cards trigger exclusion.  
- Correcting errors is bureaucratic and slow.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Weeks or months of exclusion** from housing, benefits, work, or healthcare.  
- **Disproportionate harm** to those with no buffer: low-income households, migrants, precarious workers.  
- **Secondary harms**: debt, homelessness, medical risk.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- “Errors” in ID systems are not neutral — they create cascading exclusion.  
- System resilience measured by how fast errors are fixed → usually very slow.
