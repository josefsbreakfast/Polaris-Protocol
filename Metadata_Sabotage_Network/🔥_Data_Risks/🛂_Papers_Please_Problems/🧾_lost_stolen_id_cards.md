# 🧾 Lost & Stolen ID Cards  
**First created:** 2025-09-26  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Risks created when ID cards are lost, stolen, or counterfeited — and the harms of relying on a single fragile credential.*  

---

## ✨ 1. Problem  
National ID systems promise certainty — until the token disappears.  
Cards are lost, stolen, cloned, or withheld by abusers.  
Every “proof of identity” becomes a **single point of failure**,  
where the absence of plastic equates to the loss of personhood in bureaucratic eyes.  

---

## 🛰️ 2. Consequences  
- **Exclusion** — locked out of work, benefits, housing, or healthcare until replacement.  
- **Disproportionate impact** — people without stable housing, survivors of domestic violence, asylum seekers.  
- **Criminalisation risk** — wrongful arrest or investigation when stolen cards are misused.  
- **Fraud vulnerability** — forged or duplicated cards circulate in underground economies.  
- **Bureaucratic delay** — replacement queues measured in weeks, not days, leaving people in limbo.  

Loss events transform inconvenience into **temporary civil erasure** —  
a system that withdraws recognition the moment the object vanishes.  

---

## 🍊 3. Lessons from Failure  
- **Single-token dependency** magnifies harm; resilience depends on having fallback proofs.  
- **Recovery processes** remain slow and paperwork-heavy — “security” valued over human continuity.  
- **Black markets** arise naturally where replacement barriers exist.  
- **Victim-blaming** logic persists: those who lose cards are treated as careless rather than vulnerable.  

A humane system would treat identity loss like a **fire or flood**,  
activating protection, not punishment.

## 🌍 4. Comparative Landscape  

| Jurisdiction / System | Mitigation Feature | Limitations / caveats |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **🇫🇷 France – Carte Nationale d’Identité Électronique** | Allows rapid reissue if reported stolen; supports digital certificate revocation. | Still dependent on police report and physical presence at town hall. |
| **🇩🇪 Germany – nPA (Personalausweis)** | Online “suspend” function temporarily freezes use. | Few users know it exists; reinstatement slow. |
| **🇪🇪 Estonia – eID Card** | Revocation and reissue handled in hours via digital signature. | Resilient but assumes uninterrupted online access and infrastructure trust. |
| **🇺🇸 U.S. – State IDs and Social Security Cards** | Reissue system fragmented; fraud response varies by state. | Long delays; identity theft common. |
| **🇸🇬 Singapore – NRIC System** | Mandatory replacement within 14 days; penalties for delay. | High efficiency, low compassion — fines compound stress of loss. |

Across jurisdictions, **security is prioritised over restoration**,  
and the human cost of “safe bureaucracy” remains invisible.

## 💶 5. Feasibility and Policy Remedies  

### 🧮 Potential Fixes  
- **Temporary access credentials** — time-limited digital token to maintain service access during replacement.  
- **Grace-period protocols** — automatic 30-day exemption from ID-based exclusion.  
- **Rapid reissue centres** — local reprinting hubs modelled on DVLA same-day service.  
- **Fraud notification API** — one-stop reporting to invalidate stolen credentials across all linked systems.  

### 💰 Cost Outlook (2025 – 2030)  

| Measure | Estimated cost band | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Temporary Access Token Infrastructure** | £10 – 15 million | Extension of GOV.UK authentication framework. |
| **Grace-Period Exemption Programme** | £5 – 8 million | Policy + database flag; minimal technical cost. |
| **Local Rapid-Reissue Centres** | £25 – 35 million | Modeled on DVLA + Passport Office service points. |
| **Unified Fraud Reporting API** | £8 – 12 million | Integration with Action Fraud and police databases. |

Total: **£50 – 70 million**,  
a small cost to end cycles of exclusion and criminalisation through “identity loss.”

*Lost & Stolen ID Cards* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how single-token identity systems convert loss into exclusion,  
and maps the practical and policy measures needed to prevent bureaucratic disappearance.
