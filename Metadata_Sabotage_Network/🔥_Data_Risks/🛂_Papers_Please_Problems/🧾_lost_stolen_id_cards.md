# 🧾 Lost & Stolen ID Cards  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Risks created when ID cards are lost, stolen, or counterfeited — and the harms of relying on a single fragile credential.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
- People lose cards, have them stolen, or cards are counterfeited.  
- ID schemes create a new black market in stolen credentials.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Exclusion** — locked out of work, benefits, housing, healthcare until replaced.  
- **Disproportionate impact** — homeless people, people in violent relationships, those with unstable housing.  
- **Criminalisation** — risk of wrongful arrest if someone else uses your card.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- “Single point of identity” magnifies harm when the token is missing.  
- Recovery processes are slow and bureaucratic → exclusion spirals.
