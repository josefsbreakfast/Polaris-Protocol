# 💳 Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) risks  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Case study of how BRPs, framed as neutral “modernisation,” create exclusion, discriminatory effects, and data insecurity.*  

---

## 1. Overview  
- Introduced by the UK Home Office as proof of right to stay, work, or study.  
- Designed to “streamline” immigration paperwork.  
- Holds biometric data + residence status.  

---

## 2. Core risks  
- **Validation failures** — systems unable to verify lawful status → blocked from work, housing, healthcare.  
- **Employer reluctance** — fear of fines leads employers to reject applicants when BRP scans fail.  
- **Discriminatory practice** — impacts fall disproportionately on migrants and people of colour.  
- **Renewal/expiry cycles** — short validity periods create dependency and repeated administrative stress.  
- **Data insecurity** — biometrics stored across multiple systems; unclear how deletion is handled.  

---

## 3. Case patterns  
- Students and workers with valid status denied jobs due to BRP verification errors.  
- Asylum claimants trapped in repeat renewals while awaiting decisions.  
- Employers defaulting to “safer hire” (UK passport holders) when systems are unreliable.

## 4. Lessons for ID cards  
- Shows how **neutral digital documents reproduce discrimination in practice**.  
- Demonstrates the risk of embedding fragile IT into people’s basic rights.  
- Foreshadows the harms a universal ID card would extend across the whole population.
