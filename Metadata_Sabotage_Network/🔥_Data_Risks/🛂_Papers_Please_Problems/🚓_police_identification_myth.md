# 🚓 Police Identification Myth  
**First created:** 2025-09-26  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Critique of the claim that police need national ID cards to identify people. Shows how the argument ignores existing tools, entrenches bias, and corrodes respect for law.*

## ✨ 1. The Claim  
- “Police need ID cards to identify people quickly.”  
- Framed as a pragmatic fix for administrative efficiency.  
- Reappears in media cycles whenever crime rates or migration issues are politicised.  
- Used rhetorically to make universal surveillance sound like “common sense.”  

---

## 🛰️ 2. The Reality  
UK police already possess a dense network of identification tools:  
- **PNC (Police National Computer)** lookups by name, date of birth, or address.  
- **Driving licences** — held by the majority of adults.  
- **Passports** — routinely accepted as secondary ID.  
- **Fingerprint & custody systems** — activated upon arrest.  

True non-identification cases are vanishingly rare.  
The push for national ID does not solve a policing gap — it expands a surveillance perimeter.

## 🍊 3. How Bias Shapes Use  
- **Stop and search** already targets people of colour, migrants, and young men disproportionately.  
- Adding mandatory ID creates new pretexts to stop the same groups.  
- **Facial recognition squads** show higher false-positive rates on darker skin tones and women.  
- Algorithmic error compounds structural bias; each scan becomes an act of probabilistic suspicion.  

Mandatory ID policing therefore amplifies, rather than corrects, the injustices it claims to rationalise.

## 🌍 4. Friction as Harm  
- Every unnecessary stop adds **friction** — bureaucratic drag on ordinary life.  
- Friction is a containment technology: repeated, low-level harassment teaches compliance.  
- Chronic friction shifts the emotional economy of law — from fear to exhaustion to resistance.  
- Over time, the over-policed stop hesitating out of fear and start refusing out of fatigue.  

Containment becomes counterproductive: a system that trains disobedience through overreach.

## 💶 5. Law, Fear, and Respect  
Law maintains order through two currencies: **respect** (legitimacy) and **fear** (deterrence).  
ID-based policing corrodes both.  
- It is **not respected**, because its bias and inaccuracy are visible to everyone who endures it.  
- It cannot sustain **fear**, because constant harassment normalises resistance.  

The result is a state seen not as protective, but as predatory —  
a surveillance machine that consumes trust faster than it can produce compliance.

*Police Identification Myth* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It dismantles the myth that ID cards improve policing,  
showing instead how the argument conceals bias, deepens containment,  
and weakens the very legitimacy on which lawful authority depends.
