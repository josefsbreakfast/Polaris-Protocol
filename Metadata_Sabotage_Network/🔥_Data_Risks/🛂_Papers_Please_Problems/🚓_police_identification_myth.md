# 🚓 Police Identification Myth  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Critique of the claim that police need national ID cards to identify people. Shows how the argument ignores existing tools, entrenches bias, and corrodes respect for law.*  

---

## 1. The claim  
- “Police need ID cards to identify people quickly.”  
- Framed as common-sense justification for universal identity documents.  

---

## 2. The reality  
- UK police already have multiple tools:  
  - **PNC (Police National Computer)** lookups via name/DOB/address.  
  - **Driving licences** (widely held).  
  - **Passports** (commonly used for travel/ID).  
  - **Fingerprint & custody systems** in arrests.  
- Genuine cases where police cannot establish ID are **rare**.  

---

## 3. How bias shapes use  
- **Stop & search** already disproportionately targets people of colour, migrants, and young men.  
- Adding mandatory ID = new pretext for stopping the same groups.  
- **Facial recognition squads** perform worst on richly melanated skin → more false positives for the already over-policed.  

---

## 4. Friction as harm  
- Creates **friction**: repeated stops, paperwork checks, suspicion on sight.  
- Friction itself is containment → slows and stresses daily life.  
- Chronic friction erodes fear: initial hesitation turns into resistance once fear is no longer tolerable.  

---

## 5. Law, fear, respect  
- Law deters crime through **respect** (legitimacy) or **fear** (deterrence).  
- ID policing undermines both:  
  - Not respected → visibly unfair and error-prone.  
  - Fear doesn’t sustain → constant harassment normalises resistance.
