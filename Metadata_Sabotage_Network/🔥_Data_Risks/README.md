*When data outlives consent, governance becomes possession*

## ✨ Purpose  

**Data Risks** is the forensic heart of the *Metadata Sabotage Network.*  
It shows how data persistence — records that cannot die — turns technical negligence into structural harm.  

This folder matters because most surveillance does not happen through new collection,  
but through **old data that never disappears.**  
Once information enters a state or corporate archive, it begins an afterlife: duplicated, resold, cached, or silently re-indexed.  
That afterlife determines who can move, work, heal, or disappear.  

By mapping these residual architectures, Polaris identifies how “data governance” quietly becomes **data captivity** —  
how people are held inside systems long after policy claims they were released.

## 🎋 Structure  

- **📿 Vulnerable_Data_Populations/** → groups most exposed to retention and reuse (refugees, patients, students, benefit claimants).  
- **🛂 Papers_Please_Problems/** → border control and ID verification failures that create circular surveillance.  
- **🧟‍♀️ Residual_Shadows/** → orphan datasets, zombie identifiers, and legacy system leaks.  

Together, these nodes show that what is framed as “data risk management” is often a form of **risk production** —  
a bureaucracy of endless remembering.

*🔥 Data Risks* is a living node of the *Polaris Protocol.*  

It exposes the persistence layer of metadata sabotage —  
the mechanisms by which systems remember those they claim to have forgotten.
