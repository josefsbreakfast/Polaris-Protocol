# 🗂️ The Afterlife of Harm  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-25  
*Why harm persists after the event, once it has entered networked systems*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
Many institutions treat harm as an event: a message sent, a threat made, a case closed.

But digital harm does not end when the perpetrator stops.
Once harm enters indexing, caching, scraping, and data-broker ecosystems, it can persist as an ambient environment of residue — discoverable, re-surfaceable, and repeatedly encounterable — without any new intent.

This node names that persistence as an afterlife: not supernatural, not conspiratorial, and not necessarily ongoing targeting — but structural continuation.

## ✨ Key Features
- Harm can end as behaviour while continuing as residue.
- Systems replicate content without context, intent, or decay.
- “Closure” fails when models treat harm as an incident instead of a lifecycle.
- The afterlife is often experienced through search, scraping, and misindexed identity traces.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content

### 1) Event model vs lifecycle model
The “event model” assumes:
- clear start and end,
- a single actor,
- resolution through intervention.

The “lifecycle model” observes:
- replication,
- fragmentation,
- recontextualisation,
- long-tail persistence.

Digital ecosystems reward copyability, not truth.
So the harm can outlast the moment that created it.

### 2) The replication chain
A common path:
1. Harmful material appears (harassment, defamation, impersonation, threat language).
2. It is cached, indexed, scraped, or archived.
3. Derivative pages proliferate (SEO junk, people-search pages, obituary spam, mirrors).
4. Context collapses; semantics remain.
5. The harmed person encounters it repeatedly over time.

This continuation can occur without:
- renewed hostility,
- a live perpetrator,
- or sustained human attention.

### 3) Why the afterlife is damaging even when “no one is doing anything now”
The afterlife produces:
- repeated exposure without interaction,
- meaning without agency,
- and contact without consent.

It forces the harmed person into ongoing interpretive labour:
“Is this current? Is this targeted? Is this dangerous?”
Even when the correct answer is often “no,” the environment still demands the question.

### 4) What the afterlife changes in practice
If harm is modelled as a lifecycle, responses shift from:
- “stop the person” (only),
to also:
- “reduce persistence,”
- “de-amplify residue,”
- “track where it propagates,”
- “measure re-surfacing conditions,”
- “treat search + broker ecosystems as part of the harm field.”

*The Afterlife of Harm* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how digital harm persists after the originating behaviour ends, through replication systems that preserve semantics while stripping context.
