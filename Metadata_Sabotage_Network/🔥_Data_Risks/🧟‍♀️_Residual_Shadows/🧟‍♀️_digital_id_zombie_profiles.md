*Exploration of “zombie data” risks: identity records and biometrics that persist after systems are “shut down.”*  

---

## 1. Definition  
Zombie data = residual datasets (test records, backups, orphan biometrics) that survive after an ID system is repealed or decommissioned.  

## 2. UK case study  
- Identity Cards Act 2006 repealed in 2010.  
- National Identity Register “destroyed” in 2011.  
- Critics warned vendor test sets and enrolment traces survived outside the official register.  

## 3. Risk pathways  
- **Contractor persistence** — vendors keep sandbox data.  
- **System migrations** — old records copied into new systems.  
- **Legal loopholes** — “destroyed” may mean “archived.”  

## 4. Consequences  
- Individuals haunted by duplicate or false records.  
- Future ID systems contaminated by ghost entries.  
- Inability to fully guarantee deletion = erosion of trust.
