# 🫥 Dry Humour as Data Loss — Why Models Misread the UK  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*Humour as a representational blind spot in machine learning.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Deadpan humour is a social lubricant.  
Models experience it as:

- ambiguity  
- data corruption  
- intent volatility  
- semantic gaps  
- embedding collapse  

This creates residual distortions in model outputs.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Embedding failures  
- Humour as missing data  
- Residual shadows  
- Narrative shifts

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Humour Without Cues = Confusion  
AI needs tags for tone. British humour provides none.

### 2. Embedding Drift  
Irony scrambles vector coherence → miscategorisation.

### 3. Data Risks  
British humour → uncertain classification → suppression or distortion.
