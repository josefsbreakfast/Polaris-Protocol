# 👥 Twin profiles in biometric systems  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Exploration of duplicate identity records (“twin profiles”) created by biometric mismatches or enrolment errors.*  

---

## 1. Definition  
Twin profiles = **duplicate or conflicting biometric records** for the same person, often generated when:  
- System fails to match existing entry.  
- Individual is re-enrolled under suspicion of fraud.  
- Multiple agencies maintain non-synchronised databases.  

---

## 2. UK context  
- Biometric mismatches in Home Office systems have flagged lawful residents as “suspicious.”  
- DWP and HMRC records often diverge, creating dual profiles for the same claimant.  
- ID card pilots risked cementing errors into the National Identity Register.  

---

## 3. Consequences  
- Individuals denied services, work, or benefits.  
- People subjected to suspicion, harassment, or detention.  
- Errors difficult to correct once “hard-linked” to biometrics.  

---

## 4. Lessons  
- Biometric duplication undermines accuracy claims.  
- Without robust error correction, digital ID multiplies harm.
