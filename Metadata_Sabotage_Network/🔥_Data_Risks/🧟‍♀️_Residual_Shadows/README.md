# 🧟 Residual Shadows  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Subfolder for documenting “zombie data” — records that persist after systems are shut down, repealed, or supposedly destroyed.*  

---

## Purpose  
Residual Shadows are the **ghosts of data systems**:  
- Test datasets and sandboxes left behind by contractors.  
- Backup archives not covered by destruction orders.  
- Shadow profiles created by biometric duplication or migration errors.  
- “Destroyed” registers that resurface in new guises.  

---

## Use cases in Polaris  
- To show how cancelled programmes (e.g. UK National Identity Register) still leave live traces.  
- To track evidence of zombie datasets contaminating later projects.  
- To highlight risks of trust erosion in state or corporate data handling.
