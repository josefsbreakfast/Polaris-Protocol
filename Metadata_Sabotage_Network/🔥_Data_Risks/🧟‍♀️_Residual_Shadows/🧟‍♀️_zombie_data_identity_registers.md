# 🧟 Zombie data in identity registers  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Case studies of how “destroyed” identity registers leave residual data behind: orphan datasets, contractor back-ups, test environments.*  

---

## 1. Definition  
Zombie data = **identity datasets that survive after official repeal or destruction**, often resurfacing in later systems.  

---

## 2. UK case study  
- **National Identity Register (NIR)** ordered destroyed in 2010 repeal.  
- Critics warned vendor test sets and sandbox data may have persisted.  
- Risk of contamination into later biometric systems (passports, BRPs).  

---

## 3. Risk pathways  
- **Contractors** retain test data outside statutory reach.  
- **Legacy creep** when old systems feed into new.  
- **Partial deletion** where “destroyed” = only the main register, not archives.  

---

## 4. Consequences  
- Trust erosion: citizens cannot verify data truly gone.  
- Data re-emerges in unrelated systems → “ghost matches.”  
- Permanent vulnerability even after repeal.
