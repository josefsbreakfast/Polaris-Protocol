# 📿 Vulnerable Data Populations  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Those most visible to power are those least able to refuse it*

## ✨ Purpose  

**Vulnerable Data Populations** examines how identity and data systems multiply harm for those already subject to structural inequality.  
Digital ID, biometric enrolment, and eligibility checks affect everyone — but the damage is not distributed evenly.  

This folder matters because surveillance infrastructures draw their stability from **those who cannot safely opt out**:  
children, disabled people, refugees, trauma survivors, and others made “transparent” by necessity.  
By tracing those asymmetries, this cluster shows how *protection becomes exposure* and how *care systems become capture systems.*

*Vulnerable Data Populations* is a living node of the *Polaris Protocol.*  
It traces how systems that promise care convert data into control —  
turning protection into visibility and visibility into risk.
