# 📿 Vulnerable Data Populations  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Subfolder for documenting how ID and data systems disproportionately harm vulnerable groups, magnifying existing inequalities.*  

---

## Purpose  
Identity cards and digital ID schemes create harms for everyone, but **specific groups carry the heaviest risks**. This folder tracks those vulnerabilities:  
- Children and young people.  
- Disabled people.  
- Refugees and asylum seekers.  
- Trauma survivors.  
- People in precarious housing or health situations.  
- Groups facing systemic racial or sex discrimination.
