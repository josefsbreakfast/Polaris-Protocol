# ♿ Disabled people & ID exclusion  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*How digital ID and biometric systems exclude disabled people, magnify barriers, and worsen dependency.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
Digital ID assumes universal ability to:  
- Provide standard biometrics (fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans).  
- Travel to enrolment centres.  
- Present documents on demand.  

Disabled people are systematically disadvantaged in all three.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Biometric mismatch** — worn fingerprints, mobility limitations, facial differences.  
- **Enrolment access** — inaccessible centres; lack of disability accommodation.  
- **Ongoing checks** — systems and staff not trained to handle exceptions → refusal of service.  
- **Dependency spiral** — exclusion from benefits or healthcare increases reliance on DWP/Home Office.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- ID systems are not neutral; they encode ableist assumptions.  
- Without proactive accessibility design, exclusion is inevitable.  
- Vulnerability is structural, not incidental.
