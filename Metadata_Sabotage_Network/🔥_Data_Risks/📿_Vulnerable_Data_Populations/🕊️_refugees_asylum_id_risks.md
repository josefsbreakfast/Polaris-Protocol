*How digital ID and biometric systems create disproportionate risks for refugees and asylum seekers.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
- Refugees and asylum seekers already face insecure legal status.  
- ID enrolment demands biometrics, proof documents, and repeated renewals.  
- Systems not designed for people with disrupted records or cross-border movement.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Renewal dependency** — short validity cycles force constant re-checks.  
- **Trauma triggers** — biometric capture can replicate experiences of surveillance or violence.  
- **Shadow registers** — data from temporary visas/asylum claims persist even after status resolved.  
- **Exclusion** — healthcare, housing, or work denied when records don’t match.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- Fragile legal status + fragile IT = systemic exclusion.  
- Refugees bear the highest costs of administrative failure.
