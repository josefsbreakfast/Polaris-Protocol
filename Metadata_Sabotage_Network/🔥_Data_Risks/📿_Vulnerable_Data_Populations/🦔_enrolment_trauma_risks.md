*How biometric enrolment processes can be invasive, retraumatising, or exclusionary for vulnerable groups.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

Biometric enrolment is often described as a neutral, administrative act — a photograph, a fingerprint, a scan.  
But for many, it’s an act of **coercive contact**.  
The moment of enrolment can reproduce the power dynamics of surveillance, policing, or prior trauma.  
When the process is opaque, physical, or compulsory, it becomes a **psychological checkpoint** rather than a civic one.  

---

## 1️⃣ Problem  

- **Data extraction framed as identity verification.** People are not told clearly what data will be taken, stored, or shared.  
- **Physicality as barrier.** Fingerprinting and iris scanning require touch, exposure, and often proximity to uniformed staff.  
- **Inadequate trauma literacy.** Staff seldom trained in trauma-informed procedure or consent communication.  
- **Design bias.** Systems assume all bodies are legible to machines — which is untrue for disabled, trans, or injured users.  

🪶 *Effect:* Enrolment procedures confuse identification with compliance and retraumatise those already conditioned to fear inspection.  

---

## 2️⃣ Consequences  

- **Trauma survivors** (refugees, assault victims, torture survivors) may dissociate or panic when asked to touch scanning surfaces or be photographed under harsh lighting.  
- **Disabled or chronically ill people** face exclusion if biometrics cannot register — e.g., scar tissue, tremors, or partial prints.  
- **Religious and cultural minorities** encounter violations of modesty, gender boundaries, or privacy taboos.  
- **Children and adolescents** experience premature biometric normalisation — learning to accept bodily surveillance as routine.  
- **Administrative attrition:** those who withdraw from enrolment vanish from eligibility metrics, masking systemic harm.  

🪶 *Result:* Enrolment acts as a selective filter — recording the compliant, excluding the vulnerable.  

---

## 3️⃣ Lessons  

- Enrolment is never neutral: it’s a **ritual of power**.  
- Trauma-informed, consent-based processes are not optional — they’re foundational to ethical infrastructure.  
- “One size fits all” architectures create systemic exclusion and reinforce institutional ableism.

## 🧭 Countermeasures  

**1. Trauma-Informed Training**  
Mandatory trauma-awareness and consent communication for all biometric staff.  

**2. Alternative Verification Routes**  
Parallel pathways (vouching, digital attestations, community confirmation) to avoid physical re-enactment for survivors.  

**3. Privacy by Presence**  
Design scanners and booths for choice of operator gender, lighting control, and distance; allow the subject to trigger the capture.  

**4. Accessible Design Protocols**  
Build disability variance into hardware calibration (temperature, moisture, tremor tolerance).  

**5. Public Oversight Register**  
Maintain an independent register of enrolment-site complaints and accommodation failures.  

🪶 *Principle:* Identification should never require self-violation.
