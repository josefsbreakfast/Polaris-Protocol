*How biometric enrolment processes can be invasive, retraumatising, or exclusionary for vulnerable groups.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
- Biometric enrolment requires fingerprints, photos, sometimes iris scans.  
- Process is physical, invasive, and often poorly explained.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Trauma survivors** (e.g. refugees, victims of violence) retraumatised by forced physical processes.  
- **Disabled people** may be unable to comply (fingerprint loss, mobility limits).  
- **Religious/cultural groups** pressured to breach norms.  
- **Exclusion** if people cannot complete enrolment.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- Enrolment is not neutral: it carries social, cultural, and psychological harms.  
- “One size fits all” creates systemic exclusion.
