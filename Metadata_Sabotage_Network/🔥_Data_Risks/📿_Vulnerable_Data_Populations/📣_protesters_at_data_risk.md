# 📣 Protesters At (Data) Risk  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*Why protest participation turns ordinary people into high-risk data subjects — and how modern data ecosystems amplify harm.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node frames **protesters as high-risk data subjects** within contemporary surveillance, platform, and policing ecosystems.

Participation in protest now routinely generates dense data exhaust — images, location traces, biometric identifiers, social graphs — that can persist long after the protest itself ends.

Risk does not depend on illegality.
It depends on **visibility within contested power contexts**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Reclassifies protesters as a vulnerable data population
* Maps how protest data is created, captured, and retained
* Shows why risk persists even after protests conclude
* Connects data capture to chilling effects on civic participation
* Distinguishes public assembly from consent to surveillance

---

## 📣 How Protest Creates Data Risk

Protest participation generates data through:

* facial images and video footage
* live-streams and media coverage
* mobile phone location and metadata
* social media posts and interactions
* policing databases and intelligence logs

Much of this data is created **incidentally**, not deliberately.

---

## 🧠 Why Protesters Are High-Risk Subjects

Protesters are high-risk data subjects because:

* data is captured in emotionally charged contexts
* visibility is unevenly distributed
* interpretation is politicised
* downstream use is opaque
* consent is ambiguous or absent

Risk accumulates across systems that do not coordinate safeguards.

---

## 🚓 Policing and Intelligence Layers

Protest data often feeds into:

* facial recognition systems
* crowd-mapping tools
* association analysis
* risk scoring or watchlists
* future protest pre-emption

Even lawful protest can generate enduring profiles.

---

## 📡 Platform Amplification

Platforms:

* surface protest content for engagement
* retain metadata beyond visibility windows
* respond unevenly to takedown requests
* cooperate variably with law enforcement

Visibility that feels empowering can quietly expand exposure.

---

## ⚖️ Governance Failure Mode

When protesters are not recognised as high-risk data subjects:

* data protection law is under-applied
* retention limits are ignored
* harm assessments are skipped
* chilling effects go unaddressed

Democratic participation becomes a liability.

---

## 🚨 Diagnostic Signals

Protesters are being treated as ordinary users when:

* consent is presumed from presence
* public-space logic overrides privacy
* data retention is justified as routine
* risk assessments exclude protest context
* remedies are individualised rather than systemic

These signals indicate governance blind spots.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Protest** = civic participation
* **Data capture** = coercive side effect
* **Risk status** = elevated by context, not behaviour

Participation should not require permanent exposure.

*📣 Protesters At (Data) Risk* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how protest participation produces disproportionate and lasting data risk within modern surveillance and platform systems.
