# ❤️‍🩹 Gendered Data Extraction Under Crisis  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*How crises intensify the extraction of women’s bodies, emotions, and identities as data — and why this compounds harm.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines **gendered data extraction** as a structural feature of crisis environments.

During conflict, repression, displacement, or humanitarian emergency, women and gender‑marginalised people are disproportionately required to:

* become visible,
* narrate suffering,
* display credibility,
* and translate harm into legible data.

This extraction is not incidental.
It is **systematically incentivised**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Identifies crisis as a multiplier for gendered data extraction
* Shows how women’s visibility is treated as proof, not risk
* Connects emotional labour to platform and media economies
* Explains why dignity erosion is framed as necessity
* Situates gendered harm within data‑governance failure

---

## ❤️‍🩹 What Is Being Extracted

Under crisis conditions, extraction targets:

* faces, bodies, and identifiable images
* emotional testimony and grief performance
* caregiving narratives and domestic scenes
* sexualised or moralised symbols of suffering

Women’s lives become **interfaces** for credibility.

---

## 🧠 Why Extraction Is Gendered

Gendered extraction persists because:

* women are culturally positioned as moral witnesses
* emotional expressiveness is demanded from them
* credibility is tied to recognisable femininity
* refusal is framed as selfish or uncooperative

These dynamics intensify under pressure.

---

## 📡 Platform and Media Incentives

Platforms and media reward:

* visible grief from women
* identifiable faces over anonymised testimony
* personal narrative over structural analysis
* emotional intimacy over safety

This incentivises continued exposure even when danger escalates.

---

## 🚨 Governance Failure Mode

When gendered data extraction goes unrecognised:

* women absorb disproportionate risk
* consent becomes coerced by circumstance
* long‑term surveillance footprints are created
* harm is reframed as resilience

Protection is replaced with **expectation**.

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Signals

Gendered data extraction is occurring when:

* women are asked to speak “as mothers” or “as wives”
* safety trade‑offs are normalised for visibility
* refusal to be filmed is treated as suspicious
* emotional labour substitutes for material support
* crisis coverage centres women without safeguarding them

These are extraction signals, not empowerment.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Crisis** = pressure amplifier
* **Gender** = risk multiplier
* **Data extraction** = unpaid, coerced labour

Care should never require exposure.
