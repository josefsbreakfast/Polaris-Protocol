# 💔 Gender & sex discrimination in ID cards  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*How ID systems reproduce and worsen discrimination based on gender and sex.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
- ID cards force people into rigid categories.  
- Databases often cannot handle non-binary or trans identities.  
- Mismatches between lived identity and official documents expose people to harm.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Policing bias** — stop & search disproportionately targets men of colour; women face credibility gaps in checks.  
- **Gender identity mismatch** — trans and non-binary people outed or denied services.  
- **Sex-based exclusion** — women disproportionately impacted by benefits lock-outs (DWP, housing).  
- **Compounded harms** — intersections of gender, race, and migration status amplify exposure.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- ID systems are never neutral; they encode dominant norms.  
- “Technical limitations” are excuses that entrench inequality.  
- Function creep turns small mismatches into systemic exclusions.
