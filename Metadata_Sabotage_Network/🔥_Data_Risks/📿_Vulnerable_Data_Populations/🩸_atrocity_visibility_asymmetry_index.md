# 🩸 Atrocity Visibility Asymmetry Index  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*How some atrocities become omnipresent while others fade, fragment, or disappear — and what that reveals about power, platforms, and suppression.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node introduces the **Atrocity Visibility Asymmetry Index (AVAI)** — a diagnostic framework for tracking how similar harms receive radically different levels of visibility across media, platforms, and institutional response.

The index does not measure severity of harm.
It measures **visibility allocation**.

Asymmetry in visibility is rarely accidental. It reflects:

* geopolitical alignment,
* platform incentive structures,
* narrative risk management,
* and active or passive suppression layers.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Defines visibility as a governed variable, not a neutral outcome
* Provides a comparative framework for atrocity coverage
* Distinguishes amplification failure from active suppression
* Connects visibility gaps to accountability outcomes
* Enables pattern recognition across conflicts

---

## 🩸 What the Index Tracks

The AVAI tracks divergence across dimensions such as:

* volume of coverage
* persistence over time
* language specificity (naming perpetrators)
* imagery circulation
* platform discoverability
* institutional acknowledgement

High asymmetry exists when harms of comparable scale or clarity receive sharply different treatment.

---

## 📊 Asymmetry Drivers

Visibility asymmetry is driven by overlapping factors:

* alliance protection and reputational risk
* advertiser sensitivity and brand safety rules
* platform moderation bias
* algorithmic downranking or throttling
* editorial risk aversion

No single driver is sufficient.
The effect is cumulative.

---

## 🧠 Suppression vs Drift

Not all visibility loss is overt suppression.

The index distinguishes:

* **Active suppression** — removals, shadowbans, takedowns
* **Passive drift** — de-prioritisation, fatigue framing, rotation out
* **Narrative dilution** — abstraction, passive voice, euphemism

All reduce accountability, but via different mechanisms.

---

## ⚖️ Governance Consequences

High atrocity visibility asymmetry correlates with:

* delayed or absent intervention
* reduced legal follow-through
* normalisation of harm
* survivor abandonment
* epistemic injustice

What is not seen cannot compel action.

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Use

The AVAI can be used to:

* compare coverage across conflicts or actors
* detect suppression layers early
* flag when moral language shifts without facts changing
* support pattern-based accountability claims

It is a **tool for noticing**, not a final verdict.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Atrocity** = harm with moral and legal significance
* **Visibility** = mediated access to recognition
* **Asymmetry** = power signal

When visibility diverges, ask who benefits.

*🩸 Atrocity Visibility Asymmetry Index* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how unequal visibility across comparable harms functions as a suppression signal and predictor of accountability failure.
