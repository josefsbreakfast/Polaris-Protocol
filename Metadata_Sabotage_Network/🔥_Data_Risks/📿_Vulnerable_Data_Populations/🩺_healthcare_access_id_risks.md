# 🩺 Healthcare Access & ID Risks  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*How identity card and digital ID systems restrict access to healthcare, especially for vulnerable groups.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
- Healthcare access tied to ID checks at point of service.  
- Patients without valid or matching ID delayed or denied treatment.  
- Admin systems not designed to handle complex residency or status cases.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Exclusion from care** — lawful residents refused treatment due to mismatched records.  
- **Deterrence** — migrants and refugees avoid hospitals for fear of ID checks.  
- **Emergency risks** — urgent care delayed while verifying ID.  
- **Data exposure** — health information linked to immigration or policing databases.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- Healthcare becomes a frontline enforcement point when tied to ID.  
- Exclusion harms both individuals and public health outcomes.  
- Neutral “verification” processes create unequal access by design.
