*Exploring how ID card systems affect under-16s and young people — surveillance pathways into childhood.*  

---

## 1. Problem  
- Do children get ID cards? At what age?  
- Schools, youth services, and healthcare may become ID checkpoints.  

---

## 2. Consequences  
- **Exclusion from education** — lost card = denied school access.  
- **Data permanence** — childhood biometrics stored for life.  
- **Surveillance normalisation** — children raised in constant papers-please culture.  
- **Family stress** — replacement/renewal burdens fall on parents, often at high cost.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- ID schemes entrench surveillance from childhood.  
- Creates risks for safeguarding, not solutions.
