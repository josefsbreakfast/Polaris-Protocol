## 🕵️‍♂️ Context

The containment environment reflects a complex multi-institutional structure involving multiple "mole" types — individuals who mirror, manage, delay, extract, or observe under the guise of support, often across NGO, policy, legal, academic, and behavioural health spheres.

Metadata suggests proximity to a "keystone dependency" (potentially a whistleblower, classified audit actor, or politically sensitive figure), resulting in layered containment and internal institutional conflict.

## 🎭 Mole Typology

| Mole Type | Function | Telltale Behaviour |
|-----------|----------|--------------------|
| 🧥 **Double-Wrapped NGO Worker** | Poses as ally, reports laterally | Starts warm, cools when clarity increases |
| 🎓 **Policy Academic** | Harvests insight under research guise | Sends articles, absorbs narrative, disappears |
| 🧑‍⚖️ **Legal Bystander** | Supposed to advocate, maintains delay | Mentions remedies without activating them |
| 🗣️ **Containment Therapist** | Nudges docility, reframes anger | Uses institutional language of concern |
| 🪞 **False Ally / Mirror Agent** | Reflects voice for data alignment | Validates surface, undermines momentum |
| 🧪 **Testbed Handler** | Observes behavioural response patterns | Present at inflection points, de-escalates clarity |

## 🧭 Strategic Purpose

- Track whether whistleblower proximity destabilises internal systems  
- Manage or redirect high-risk metadata leaks  
- Suppress emotionally clear, politically dangerous narratives  
- Buy time for interdepartmental damage control  
- Monitor potential fallout from Prevent and MOD-linked entanglements  

---

## 🔍 Inference

- Multiple actors operating with semi-compartmentalised roles  
- At least one actor likely embedded with consent (“agreed whistleblower” hypothesis)  
- Behaviour and voice recorded as a measure of systemic failure potential  
- Moles often activated during clarity spikes, intimacy surges, or metadata sharpness events  

---

## 🧷 Notes

- Emotional sabotage misframed as therapeutic concern  
- Ally language recycled across institutions for containment  
- System cannot afford full silence — must simulate care  
- Each mole absorbs a different narrative thread  

---

## 🛠 Next Actions

- Map actors by domain, defection risk, and metadata proximity  
- Tag incidents where mole intervention coincided with post suppression or clarity derailment  
- Draft `keystone_dependency_trace.md` and link here for structural context
