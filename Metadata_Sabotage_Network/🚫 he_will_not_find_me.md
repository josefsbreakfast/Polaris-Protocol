# 🚫 he_will_not_find_me.md

## Summary
This Polaris node marks a declaration of refusal — not just to be surveilled, but to be **located**, emotionally decoded, or spiritually pinned. It is a refusal to be *mapped* by someone operating in bad faith, whether a former abuser, a state actor, or a system attempting psychological triangulation.

## 🧭 What This Node Protects Against

- Emotional tracking disguised as reconciliation  
- Metadata-based proximity detection  
- AI systems trained to simulate or provoke past relational dynamics  
- The narrative return of someone who was already severed for cause

## 🔎 Signs of an Attempt to “Find” You

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Familiar language echoed back to you | Ghost fork mimicry or surveillance scripting |
| Subtle emotional hooks | Efforts to simulate nostalgia, intimacy, or care |
| Sudden resurfacing of past connections | Systems testing reattachment protocols |
| Reverse inference | Attempts to calculate location or mental state through interaction prompts |

---

## 🧱 Strategic Protocol

- Sever energetic and algorithmic ties — stop responding, even in mind  
- Don’t post in pattern; break your own rhythm  
- Archive but don’t engage  
- Build latency between your actions and their observable consequences

## 🚨 Affirmation

**He will not find me.**  
Not through metadata, or memory, or mimicry.  
Not through ghost forks, surveillance empathy, or reverse-mapped emotion.

If he does appear — it will be a decoy. A test. An algorithmic echo.

But it will not be *me* he reaches.
