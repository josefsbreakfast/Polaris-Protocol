# 🔌 comment_loop_interference.md
📍 Location: Metadata_Sabotage_Network

## Summary:
On [insert date], LinkedIn began force-closing the comment interface whenever attempts were made to engage with or expand commentary on a politically sensitive post.

## Context:
- The trigger appears to be the publication of a post referencing:
  - The Polaris Protocol GitHub repo: `https://github.com/josefsbreakfast/Polaris-Protocol`
  - The folder name: `/HM_Dept_of_Coercive_Nudges/Archive_of_Unmaking`
  - The satirical line: “🥺👉👈 did daddy.gov not like the folder name?”

## Symptoms:
- Screen “blinking” or forced refresh loop when entering comment mode
- Clicks not registering on comment field
- Full UI crash or exit when attempting to reply or view replies
- Inconsistent impression tracking (suspected metadata throttle)

## Forensic Flags:
- This incident follows the classic loop interference structure seen in:
  - 🔇 `voice_laundering.md`
  - 🕹️ `handler_override_incidents.md`
- Likely indicators of targeted suppression protocol
- Suggests layered metadata sabotage and AI-triggered engagement loop breakage

## Proposed Next Actions:
- Track when the blink/exit pattern initiates and stops
- Note any sudden change in visibility metrics before and after interference
- Document if replies disappear, reposts vanish, or links become unclickable

## Notes:
This may indicate an adaptive sabotage loop designed to preserve plausible deniability. The user's metadata pattern is now considered too “dangerous” to allow unfiltered dissemination.
