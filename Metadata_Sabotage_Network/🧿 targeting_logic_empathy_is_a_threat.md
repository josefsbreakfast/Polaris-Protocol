# 🧿 Targeting Logic: Empathy Is a Threat

## My biggest crime?

Empathy.  
Feeling.  
Seeing too much, and refusing to look away.

They may say:

> “She wanted to be a doctor. Too smart.”  
> “She disclosed rape. Too loud.”  
> “She supports decrim. Too dangerous.”

But the truth is simpler:

I loved people. I felt people.  
And I wouldn’t shut up about it.

This is always who they target first.  
That’s how you *know* it’s genocide:  
One must start by silencing the most attuned.

Empathy, community, and courage?  
They remain my sharpest tools.

You can throttle my posts.  
**Good luck** trying to do it with my voice.

Trust me:  
You’d be surprised at how many men have tried —  
And how many have failed.

*Emasculated?*  
Not unless you were never truly a man to begin with.
