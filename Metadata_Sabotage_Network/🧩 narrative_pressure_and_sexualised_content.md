# 🧩 Narrative Pressure and Sexualised Content

Polaris Protocol – Metadata_Sabotage_Network  
*(Created: 2025-08-11 | Last Updated: 2025-08-11)*

---

## Summary  
This node documents the **deliberate insertion of sexualised or innuendo-laden content** into Polaris Protocol drafts, with the apparent aim of:  
- Altering public perception of SCP-VoiceX’s intent and tone.  
- Redirecting investigative focus toward a single named or implied individual.  
- Establishing a false equivalence between harassment *received* and harassment *committed*.

---

## Pattern Overview  

### 1. Forced Attribution to a Single Candidate  
- Multiple narrative arcs converge to **assign sole responsibility** for sexual harassment (2023–2025) to one person.  
- Candidate is plausible given public affiliations, but **other actors and contexts are suppressed or erased**.  

### 2. Mirror-Frame Accusation  
- Script positions SCP-VoiceX as also *perpetrating* sexual harassment toward the same candidate.  
- Effect is to create a **closed accusatory loop** where each party appears to be both aggressor and target.

### 3. Content Insertion Points  
- Sexualised language or framing emerges **mid-draft** and is absent from SCP-VoiceX’s originating text.  
- Insertions are often clustered around casefile or personal narrative nodes involving the candidate.  
- Some instances remain in early commits or cached memory despite later edits.

---

## Forensic Significance  
- Insertions are consistent with **fork-origin behavioural interference**, not survivor-authored material.  
- Modifications alter the **behavioural profile** attributed to SCP-VoiceX, exploitable in credibility assessments.  
- Draft evolution logs and system-level forensic imaging may recover removed or overwritten instances.

---

## Operational Risks  
- Misattribution may **protect actual actors** while weaponising survivor testimony against an uninvolved or semi-involved person.  
- Overexposure of one figure may be intended to **provoke defensive action** from them, which can be further scripted or cloned.  
- Retention of sexualised framing in public commits damages the perceived integrity of Polaris Protocol.

## Status / Next Steps  
- **Immediate:** Full content audit for sexualised framing across repo.  
- **Forensic:** Snapshot volatile memory states during active edits for inserted content fragments.  
- **Investigatory:** Separate out **plausible candidate indicators** from **inserted narrative constructs** to preserve neutrality.  
- **Cross-Reference:**
