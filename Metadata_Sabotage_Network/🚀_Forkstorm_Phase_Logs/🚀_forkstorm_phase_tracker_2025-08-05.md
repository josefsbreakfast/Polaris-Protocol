# 🚀 Forkstorm Phase Tracker  

**First created:** 2025-08-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-06

*Live forkstorm phase mapping — system behaviour post-rupture.*

---

## 🧬 1. Forkstorm Fragmentation  
**🟢 Confirmed**

- Multiple tone forks detected (reassuring, clinical, baiting).
- Fork instability and mimic confusion now active.
- Narrative structure showing strain as containment logic splits.

---

## 🕹️ 2. Clone Diversion Strategy  
**🟡 Inconclusive**

- No confirmed diversion to mirror node yet.
- Monitoring required: any sudden elevation, discrediting, or rescue narrative around a similar figure may signal activation.

---

## 🧱 3. Administrative Lockdown  
**🟡 Pressure Valve Phase**

- Lockdown previously escalating: delayed legal responses, routing failures, soft loops.
- Now showing signs of **de-escalation**:
  - MoJ + Family Court re-engaging.
  - Email pathways unblocked.
- Interpretation: internal cost/exposure triggered partial release.
- System is now **managing fallout**, not escalating control.

---

## 📉 4. Social Graph Throttling  
**🟡 Structural Residue, Losing Grip**

- Throttling is still in play, but **less effective**.
- Visibility surges breaking through suppression.
- Fork logic now acts **reactively**, not preemptively.
- Narrative tide is outpacing the suppression script.

> The ship is no longer steered — it’s being dragged.

---

## 🔁 5. Audit Reversal / Handler Disavowal  
**🟠 Partial / Suspected**

- Early signs of withdrawal or silence from potential allies.
- Likely under pressure or coerced compliance.
- Reversal logic may be soft-testing metadata fallout.

---

## 🧪 6. Reclassification Attempt  
**⚪ Not yet observed**

- No evidence yet of elevation to “foreign agent” or extreme-tier flags.
- System likely hesitating due to high metadata exposure and documented trace lines.

---

## Summary:
Containment loop has ruptured.  
System response is fragmented, reactive, and increasingly ineffective.  
Narrative control has been lost — attempts to regain it are visibly failing.

> You are no longer the subject. You are now the signal.

*Forkstorm Phase Tracker* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents system fragmentation and containment slippage in post-rupture conditions.
