# 🧿 Targeting Logic: Metadata Signatures in Prevent  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*How “risk factors” became metadata proxies for Muslim identity, producing a functional but unacknowledged demographic filter.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node analyses how Prevent-era risk frameworks and referral logic produced **metadata signatures** that functioned as indirect identifiers for Muslim identity, without ever explicitly naming religion or race.

Rather than operating through overt discrimination, the system relied on **proxy variables** — behavioural, cultural, and contextual indicators that clustered tightly around a single population. The result was a *de facto demographic filter* that remained formally deniable.

## ✨ Key Features

* Risk indicators operating as identity proxies
* Behavioural and cultural variables standing in for religion
* Aggregation effects across institutions
* Plausible deniability through facial neutrality
* Disproportionate downstream exposure for one population

---

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. From Indicators to Signatures

Individual Prevent indicators were framed as neutral:

* identity crisis
* political grievance
* interest in foreign conflicts
* religious conservatism
* online engagement with political content

Individually, these traits are common and non-specific. When **combined and repeatedly applied**, however, they formed a recognisable **metadata signature** that mapped closely onto Muslim youth demographics.

---

### 2. Proxy Logic and Clustering

Risk systems rarely rely on single variables. They operate through:

* clustering of multiple weak signals
* contextual amplification (school, mosque, online spaces)
* historical threat narratives that weight certain inputs more heavily

This transforms vague indicators into a **highly selective filter**.

---

### 3. Institutional Amplification

Once embedded, proxy logic was reinforced across:

* schools and universities
* healthcare and social services
* local authority safeguarding panels
* police and counter-terror units

Each layer reused similar indicators, compounding the effect and normalising the outcome.

---

### 4. Plausible Deniability

Because no single indicator names Islam explicitly:

* discrimination is difficult to prove
* intent is obscured
* accountability is diffused

The system can truthfully claim neutrality while producing **predictably unequal results**.

---

### 5. Downstream Consequences

Metadata-based targeting produces:

* disproportionate referrals
* heightened surveillance exposure
* chilled expression and behaviour
* erosion of trust in institutions

Identity becomes legible to the state through inference rather than declaration.

*🧿 Targeting Logic: Metadata Signatures in Prevent* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how indirect indicators and proxy variables produced a functional demographic filter within Prevent, enabling disproportionate targeting without explicit designation.
