# 🪽 Those “You Are God” Videos  
**First created:** 2025-12-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-16  
*Why identity-addressing, grandiose short-form videos are more dangerous than they look — and how to refuse their data extraction.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

A recurring short-form video niche has emerged across algorithmic feeds using second-person, identity-affirming language such as *“you are chosen,” “you are protected,” “you are becoming a god.”*

These videos are often dismissed as harmless fantasy, motivational spirituality, or fringe content. That framing is insufficient.

This is **not primarily a belief problem**.  
It is a **data-extraction, mental-health, and future-risk problem**.

The danger lies in what these formats *catalyse*, *measure*, and *optimise* — and in how that data could be repurposed under different political conditions.

## ✨ Key Features (Format Anatomy)

This content functions as a recognisable, repeatable niche rather than isolated clips. Common features include:

- **Direct second-person address**  
  (“You are classified as…”, “You have just been activated…”)

- **Pseudo-institutional language**  
  (“Level 7”, “protected”, “classified”, “target”)

- **Mythic / grandiose identity escalation**  
  (“chosen one”, “bloodline of the gods”, “becoming divine”)

- **Serialisation with withheld resolution**  
  (“Part 1”, implied continuation)

- **Low falsifiability, high authority tone**  
  Claims structured to resist easy verification or rejection

This makes the format **deployable, scalable, and analytically valuable** — regardless of creator intent.

## 🧿 Catalyst Content and Mental Health Risk  

These videos are best understood as **catalyst content**.

They do not cause mental illness.  
They can, however, **lower activation energy** for people already near vulnerability thresholds.

### Why this matters:

- The content **rehearses grandiose identity structures**
- It affirms **special mission / hidden status narratives**
- It lacks grounding or fictional framing
- It uses motivational, directive language aimed *at* the viewer

For individuals susceptible to:
- manic episodes
- psychotic ideation
- dissociative destabilisation
- severe anxiety or paranoia  

…this format can contribute to escalation or crisis.

This is a foreseeable risk.  
Under any “do no harm” framework, foreseeable risk triggers responsibility.

## 🔬 The Deeper Risk: Epistemic & Psychological Profiling  

The most dangerous layer is not the message — it is the **analytics**.

Interaction with this format allows inference of:

- tolerance for ambiguity  
- identity resonance  
- disbelief thresholds  
- cognitive persistence  
- susceptibility to self-referential narratives  

This is **epistemic profiling**: measuring *how* people think and doubt, not just *what* they believe.

Crucially:  
> Belief is not required.  
> Sceptical, analytical viewers often generate the richest data.

This enables future narrative engineering that can:
- evade immediate rejection
- survive sceptical scrutiny
- exploit psychological vulnerability
- fragment shared reality without overt persuasion

---

## ⚠️ Information-Warfare Implications  

Modern disinformation does not require mass belief.  
It requires **uncertainty, identity destabilisation, and fatigue**.

Once cognitive thresholds are measurable, narratives can be tuned to:
- sit just below rejection points
- resist fact-checking
- exploit ambiguity rather than assert claims

Comparable dynamics have already influenced major political movements and elections internationally.

This is a **dual-use capability** created by optimisation, not necessarily intent.

## 📜 Historical Precedent: When Records Become Weapons  

The Holocaust provides the clearest historical lesson on data harm under authoritarian capture.

In Nazi-occupied Netherlands, unusually comprehensive census and municipal records — including religious affiliation and household data — enabled exceptionally efficient identification, targeting, and deportation of Jewish residents. These records were not created for persecution; they were created for governance.

Across occupied Europe, similar patterns repeated. While rare cases of negotiated protection existed, the overwhelming outcome was that **legibility increased lethality**.

The lesson is not that data collection is inherently evil.  
The lesson is that **data persists across regimes, while safeguards do not**.

Psychological and epistemic profiles — invisible, inferred, and contestable only after the fact — carry particularly high future risk if political power shifts.

---

## 🛑 “Do No Harm” Applies Here  

In medicine, psychology, and research ethics:

> If an intervention foreseeably increases harm for a subset of people, it must be redesigned or halted — even if most subjects are unaffected.

Calling this “content” does not exempt it.

Extracting vulnerability signals, optimising delivery toward them, and retaining those profiles without consent or duty of care is **inherently discriminatory**, regardless of intent.

---

## 🧰 Resistance: How to Refuse the Data Extraction  

The countermeasure is simple and effective:

**Do not engage in the way the format expects.**

That means:
- do not watch through  
- do not rewatch or pause  
- do not comment (even critically)  
- do not share “ironically”  

The most effective response is:
- immediate scroll-past  
- or closing the app entirely  

This is not disengagement from reality.  
It is **withdrawal of consent**.

> If a video speaks *to you* as a special subject rather than *about* an idea, it is not information — it is instrumentation.

Instrumentation fails when users refuse to cooperate.

*🪽 Those “You Are God” Videos* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents a high-risk content format at the intersection of mental health, data analytics, and information warfare, with emphasis on informed refusal rather than amplification.
