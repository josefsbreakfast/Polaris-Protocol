# 🫠 Projection Leak Signature  
**First created:** 2025-12-08 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-09  
*How fabricators accidentally disclose their own anxieties, logic gaps, and metadata ignorance.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Projection leaks are one of the most reliable fingerprints in falsified communications.  
They occur when an actor inserts unnecessary, emotionally loaded, or domain-incoherent details into a spoof, accusation, or blackmail attempt — revealing more about themselves than about their target.

This node maps the **four-part diagnostic signature** investigators use to identify projection leakage.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Unnecessary or narratively irrelevant detail  
- Data-interpretation inversion  
- Self-referential anxiety markers  
- Asymmetrical curation of “evidence fragments”

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. **UD-01 — The Unnecessary Detail**  
A hyper-specific detail that offers the actor no strategic advantage.  
Its inclusion increases risk and decreases coherence.  
Its presence signals compulsion, not intention.

### 2. **IIE-02 — Interpretation-Inversion Error**  
The fabricator misreads a data fragment (e.g., search strings, symptom descriptors) and assigns the opposite meaning.  
This exposes their lack of domain literacy and their reliance on imagination rather than fact.

### 3. **SAM-03 — Self-Referential Anxiety Marker**  
A detail that does not match the target’s behaviour but *does* match the sender’s emotional preoccupations.  
Often linked to shame, competence, masculinity, capability, or health.

### 4. **AOC-04 — Asymmetry of Curation**  
The actor “selects” fragments of data without constructing a coherent narrative around them.  
This reveals the message was assembled from their own projections inward, not from evidence outward.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🫠 Projection Leak Signature* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It provides a diagnostic toolkit for analysing falsified or coercive communications that reveal the fabricator’s internal state more clearly than the target’s.
