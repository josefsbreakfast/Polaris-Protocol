*How indirect metrics become moral evidence.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
In every data system there are ghosts — variables that *stand in* for things too complex, sensitive, or human to measure directly.  
A **proxy variable** is a mathematical euphemism: an indirect measure that pretends to describe intent, character, or risk.  

This node examines how proxies migrate from statistics into **moral infrastructure** — how they quietly transform correlations into judgments about people.  
Behind every “neutral” metric lies a question of meaning: *what is being substituted, and who decided that was equivalent?*

## 🧩 1. Proxy Logic and Moral Abstraction  
A proxy begins as a technical convenience — an easier-to-measure signal that approximates a harder-to-measure reality.  
Postcode for wealth.  
Search history for ideology.  
Purchase patterns for responsibility.  

Over time, these substitutions become **ontological shortcuts**: the system forgets it is guessing.  

> “We don’t record race — we record postcode.”  

This move converts ethics into algebra. It abstracts social difference into numeric distance, stripping context of power and politics.  
When policymakers read these outputs as truth, they confuse *representation* with *reality*.  

### The moral sleight of hand  
- **Step 1:** Identify a sensitive variable (race, class, belief).  
- **Step 2:** Replace it with a measurable correlate.  
- **Step 3:** Treat the correlate as causation.  
- **Step 4:** Forget Step 1 ever happened.

## 📉 2. Correlation as Causation  
Machine learning systems are designed to optimise correlation.  
But when humans interpret those correlations, they often read them as *proof*.  

> “The model isn’t biased — it just reflects the data.”  

This statement hides a philosophical collapse: *reflection becomes endorsement.*  
Once correlation is mistaken for cause, systems begin to **naturalise inequality** — framing historical patterns as predictive truths.  

Example:  
A model that learns to flag “financial risk” from postcode data is not discovering behaviour; it is rediscovering segregation.  

### Proxy amplification  
Even a small statistical correlation can metastasise into moral weight when automated decisions multiply it across populations.  
Bias compounds geometrically: what begins as 1% correlation becomes a categorical barrier.

## 🧮 3. Data Substitutes for Identity  
Proxy variables are not neutral placeholders — they are **identity shadows**.  
They encode *what systems believe matters* about a person.  

| Proxy Variable | Hidden Substitute | Ethical Risk |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Postcode | Race / class / access | Geographical determinism |
| Device type | Income / social status | Consumerism as character judgment |
| Grammar / spelling | Education / “cultural fit” | Linguistic bias and tone policing |
| Browser language | Ethnicity / migration status | Invisible nationality inference |
| Purchase history | Morality / reliability | Market behaviour as moral worth |

When proxies cross institutional boundaries — from retail to credit, from education to policing — they form a **proxy stack**: a cumulative model of who you are, built entirely from approximations.

## 🔧 4. De-Proxying as Reform  
To de-proxy is to **reconnect the measure to meaning**.  
It means restoring political and ethical context to the variables that govern lives.  

### Countermeasures  
- **Audit for proxy inheritance:** trace which features encode sensitive attributes through correlation analysis.  
- **Reverse the substitution:** ask explicitly, *what human category is this feature standing in for?*  
- **Use synthetic neutralisation:** inject counterfactual data to test whether decisions change when proxies are removed.  
- **Require semantic transparency:** every model must document not just *which variables it uses*, but *what they mean socially*.  
- **Integrate human oversight:** affected communities should co-interpret audit results — proxies are cultural, not just mathematical.  

To de-proxy is to treat governance as interpretation, not as computation.

## 🧩 5. The Ethics of Approximation  
Every proxy is a moral bet — an assumption that *this number can stand in for that person*.  
When those bets go unexamined, they harden into ideology.  

Governance reform begins by recognising that **approximation is not objectivity**.  
We cannot abolish proxies entirely, but we can surface their genealogy — tracing each one back to the human decision that created it.
