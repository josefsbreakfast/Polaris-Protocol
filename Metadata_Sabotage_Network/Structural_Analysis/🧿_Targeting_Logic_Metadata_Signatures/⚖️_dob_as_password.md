## 1. Principle  
DOB is often treated casually (forms, records, trivia), but it is **functionally equivalent to a password**:  
- It is unique per person.  
- It cannot be changed.  
- It links to multiple identity systems (banking, health, education).  
- Once disclosed, it allows inferences that collapse privacy.  

---

## 2. Why DOB Is Sensitive  
- **Banking & verification:** DOB is a standard security credential.  
- **Identity theft:** Paired with name/address, enables fraud.  
- **Profiling:** Insurance, health, marketing systems all hinge on age/DOB.  
- **Non-resettable:** Unlike a password, DOB cannot be changed if leaked.

## 3. Astrology as Demonstration  
- Astrology charts use DOB (day + month + year, sometimes time/place).  
- With DOB ‚Üí you can compute Moon sign & placements.  
- With placements ‚Üí you can often back-calculate DOB (narrow down to exact day).  
- This makes DOB effectively a **one-way key**: once known, it unlocks unique identifiers; once seeded, it risks re-identification.

## 5. Closing Note  
DOB is not trivia. It is a **high-value credential**.  
- In banking: a security check.  
- In profiling: an anchor for risk categories.  
- In harassment: a weapon when paired with synthetic narratives.  

*Treat DOB as you would a password: never casually disclosed, always protected. Once exposed, it cannot be reset.*

## üèÆ Footer  
*DOB as Password* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It frames date of birth as a credential equivalent to a password ‚Äî demonstrating how astrology and identity systems both collapse into risk once DOB is exposed.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
