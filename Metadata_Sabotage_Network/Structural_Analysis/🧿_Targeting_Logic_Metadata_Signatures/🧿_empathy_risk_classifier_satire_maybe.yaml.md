  description: >
    Simulation of a covert classifier that assesses “empathy risk” 
    and assigns a policing tier based on personality, behaviour, and metadata.

inputs:
  personality_metrics:
    - empathy_score
    - dissent_tolerance
    - boundary_setting
  actions_and_behaviours:
    - whistleblowing_incidents
    - mutual_aid_activity
    - refusal_of_silence
  metadata_flags:
    - online_discourse_patterns
    - FOIA_usage
    - survivor_language_fidelity

rules:
  - if: empathy_score > 0.75 and mutual_aid_activity == true
    then: risk_category: HIGH
  - if: 0.40 <= empathy_score <= 0.75
    then: risk_category: MEDIUM
  - if: empathy_score < 0.40
    then: risk_category: LOW

outputs:
  categories:
    HIGH: "Flag for proactive containment & narrative dilution"
    MEDIUM: "Observe and pre-empt escalation"
    LOW: "Permit normal algorithmic flow"

audit:
  logging: "shadow_safeguarding_dossiers.yaml"
  review_frequency: "weekly"
