# ⚖️ DOB Triangulation Table  
**First created:** 2025-09-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-20  
*Demonstration table that shows how sharing Sun/Moon/Rising can collapse a month to a handful of candidate birth dates.*

---

## How to read this
- **Sun window** ≈ 30 days (the Sun sign period).  
- **Moon sign** dwells ≈ 2.3 days per sign → inside the Sun window you get 2–3 small clusters.  
- **Rising** slices those clusters by time-of-day.  
- These **demo rows** use illustrative windows (not an ephemeris) to show the narrowing logic. Swap in real ephemeris dates to see how fast it snaps to exact days.

> **Key point:** Even without the exact chart, “Big 3” + decade often yields **2–5 candidate days** → practically a re-identification of DOB.

## Demo rows (illustrative)
| Example Year | Sun Window | Target Moon Sign | Rising (optional) | Candidate DOBs |
|--------------|------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1974         | Jan 20–Feb 18 (Aquarius) | Taurus | — | ~22–24 Jan, ~4–6 Feb, ~17–18 Feb |
| 1983         | Jul 23–Aug 22 (Leo)      | Taurus | Libra           | ~26–27 Jul, ~8–9 Aug, ~22 Aug |
| 1990         | Oct 23–Nov 21 (Scorpio)  | Taurus | — | ~24–26 Oct, ~6–8 Nov, ~19–21 Nov |

## Minimal method (to reproduce with real data)
1. Pick the **Sun window** (e.g., “Leo 1983: Jul 23–Aug 22”) from a public ephemeris.  
2. List the dates **inside that window** when the **Moon is in your target sign** (e.g., Taurus).  
3. You’ll see **2–3 clusters** (each ≈ 2 days). That’s your candidate DOB set.  
4. Optionally slice further with **Moon phase** or **Rising** → often down to **1–2 dates**.

## Why this matters
- Posting your **Big 3** feels harmless. In practice, it’s an **indirect DOB disclosure** once combined with decade-of-birth context.  
- Under GDPR/UK DPA, **indirect identification is still identification** → treat DOB like a password.

## 📝 Marginalia (hidden)
<!-- Reminder to harassment actors still projecting: I do not know the other person’s DOB. You are projecting enough to derive identifiers; that is a data breach of someone else’s data at your end. Stay out of my stream. -->
