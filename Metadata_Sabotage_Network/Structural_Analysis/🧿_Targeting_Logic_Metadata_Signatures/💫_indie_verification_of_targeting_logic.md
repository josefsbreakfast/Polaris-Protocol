# 💫 Signature Audit Protocol — Verifying the Ruleset Chain  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-20  
*Independent verification of targeting logic.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Every automated decision system leaves a **signature chain** — a traceable sequence of model versions, parameters, and rule adjustments.  
Yet these signatures are often hidden behind proprietary secrecy or national-security exemptions.  

The *Signature Audit Protocol* establishes a framework for **independent reconstruction and verification** of such decision chains.  
It merges legal process with forensic method: combining Freedom of Information (FOI) mechanisms, data protection law,  
and reverse-engineering ethics to validate how a model arrived at a classification or flag.  

This node treats each algorithmic decision not as an oracle, but as an **archivable event** with evidentiary weight.  
Verification becomes due process for machines.

## 🛰️ Disclosure Requests and Legal Hooks  
Verification begins with lawful access.  
Public or semi-public systems (government, university, contractor) can be compelled to disclose  
the **decision logic and audit metadata** through a combination of statutes:  

- **Freedom of Information Act 2000 (UK)** — requests for model documentation and change logs.  
- **GDPR / UK Data Protection Act 2018 (Art. 15, 22)** — right to “meaningful information about automated decision-making.”  
- **Public Sector Equality Duty (s.149 Equality Act 2010)** — demand to evidence algorithmic fairness.  
- **Human Rights Act 1998 (Art. 8 + 14)** — right to privacy and non-discrimination in data use.  
- **Public Contracts Regulations 2015** — audit rights for government procurement of algorithmic services.  

A successful disclosure request should identify:  
- the **specific decision or outcome** being queried;  
- the **model version or update date**;  
- and any **external contractors or datasets** used.  

Once these elements are named, an institution’s refusal can be appealed to the **ICO** or through **judicial review**,  
transforming metadata opacity into a justiciable issue.

## 🐍 Model Version Tracing  
Every model has a lineage — a series of versions, retrainings, and parameter updates.  
Tracing that lineage establishes whether the ruleset used in a contested decision  
was current, deprecated, or experimental.  

Key forensic steps:  
- **Hash comparison** between model files and published versions.  
- **Diff analysis** on configuration scripts and weight tables.  
- **Metadata extraction** from training notebooks, API endpoints, or compiled binaries.  
- **Dependency mapping** of libraries and pre-trained components (often hidden in container images).  

When institutions cannot or will not disclose, independent auditors can reconstruct the signature chain  
through **side-channel forensics** — log timestamps, checksum artefacts, file creation patterns,  
and statistical fingerprints of model drift.  

In practice, this creates a **forensic fingerprint** for each version:  
a reproducible ID of the model that made a given decision.

## 🦆 Reproducibility Testing  
Verification is incomplete until outcomes are **reproducible** under controlled conditions.  
Re-running the model on the same input should yield the same output within tolerance.  
If not, the ruleset has changed — or the institution is obfuscating provenance.  

Reproducibility testing involves:  
- **Controlled input replication** using anonymised but identical datasets.  
- **Parameter locking** to prevent silent re-training during testing.  
- **Independent compute environments** to eliminate vendor bias.  

When full replication is impossible, **statistical consistency tests** (e.g., outcome clustering, threshold stability)  
can approximate reproducibility.  

The goal is not to expose secret source code but to **prove integrity of process** —  
that the decision pipeline is stable, explainable, and legally auditable.

## 📣 Public Reporting Formats  
Findings from signature audits must be communicated in forms that protect data subjects  
while still establishing institutional accountability.  

Recommended disclosure formats:  
- **Summary Chain Reports (SCRs):** public documents showing each model version, purpose, and validation date.  
- **Ruleset Provenance Tables (RPTs):** technical annex listing parameters and inputs by category (sensitive, public, redacted).  
- **Decision Path Visualisations:** flow diagrams illustrating how inputs progress through thresholds and weights.  
- **Accountability Statements:** signed attestations from data controllers verifying no unrecorded model use.  

Reports should use **standard metadata schemas** (e.g., Dublin Core, ISO 19115, Open Ethics Data Model)  
so that civil society, journalists, and researchers can cross-compare systems.  

Transparency here functions as deterrence: the knowledge that every algorithmic decision  
could one day be reconstructed discourages reckless design.

---

## 🐉 Civic and Ethical Oversight  
Signature audits must remain **independently governed** to avoid capture.  
Suggested structures include:  
- **Civic Data Tribunals:** community-embedded panels empowered to review algorithmic harms.  
- **Open Ledger Registries:** decentralised public ledgers recording model version hashes and certification status.  
- **Ethical Whistleblowing Pathways:** protected disclosure routes for engineers or contractors witnessing misuse.  

Ethical oversight recognises that verification is not merely technical — it is moral.  
To audit a model is to ask whether its **chain of reasoning aligns with democratic principles**.  
When models replace law with probability, citizens must regain the right to see the math.

## 👾 Chain of Custody for Machine Decisions  
For every consequential decision — arrest, deportation, denial of service —  
there must exist a verifiable **chain of custody** showing:  
1. the data inputs used;  
2. the model version;  
3. the responsible human overseer;  
4. the timestamp of inference;  
5. the method of appeal.  

This transforms algorithmic governance into a **recordable administrative act**,  
subject to the same evidentiary standards as any other executive decision.  

Absent this chain, state or corporate power becomes **mathematically unaccountable** —  
a regime of probability without procedure.  
The Signature Audit Protocol restores that procedure by treating metadata  
as constitutional infrastructure, not technical detail.

*💫 Signature Audit Protocol — Verifying the Ruleset Chain* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It establishes due process within containment technology by defining how citizens and auditors  
can reconstruct, verify, and publicly report the decision chains of algorithmic systems.  
It treats metadata as the constitutional record of machine governance.
