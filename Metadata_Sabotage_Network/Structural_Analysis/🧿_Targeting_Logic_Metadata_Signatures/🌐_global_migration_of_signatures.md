# 🌐 Cross-Jurisdiction Patterning — Global Migration of Signatures  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-04  
*How vendor logic travels faster than law.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
The infrastructures of surveillance and targeting are no longer national — they are franchised.  
Procurement templates, data-sharing agreements, and “interoperability standards” allow **algorithmic logics to migrate across borders** long before legislators notice.  

The result is what Polaris calls **cross-jurisdiction patterning**: the global cloning of decision systems, where one nation’s “best practice” becomes another’s containment architecture.  
This node traces how **vendor ecosystems** evolve faster than law — and how the same scoring rules, moderation systems, and suppression algorithms recur across continents with minor linguistic translation.  

---

## 🧩 1. Vendor Ecosystems — The Franchise Model of Governance  
Public institutions rarely design from scratch. They import.  
Procurement chains link ministries, municipalities, and agencies to a handful of private contractors whose products are already **pre-trained on foreign data**.  

### Common patterns  
- **Platform replication:** A welfare fraud detection model built in the Netherlands resurfaces in the UK, Australia, or Kenya under a new brand.  
- **Code migration:** Source code is “localised,” not rewritten — same architecture, different UI.  
- **Consultant diaspora:** Ex-employees of one vendor act as “independent advisors” to regulators elsewhere, reintroducing the same frameworks as “standards.”  

What travels here is not data but *design ideology* — the assumption that if a model “worked” once, it must be universal.  
In this way, governance becomes a **global franchise**, with vendors as franchisors and states as franchisees.

## ⚖️ 2. Legal Interoperability Gaps — When Regulation Lags Behind Replication  
Data protection laws are written nationally, but machine learning supply chains are **jurisdictionally agnostic**.  
When a targeting system crosses borders, so does its embedded bias — yet accountability does not.  

### Structural gaps  
| Layer | Description | Consequence |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Procurement Templates** | Contract language copied between governments | Replicates identical data-sharing loopholes |
| **Cross-Cloud Hosting** | Models trained in one data zone but deployed elsewhere | Blurs regulatory boundaries and consent scope |
| **Subcontractor Chains** | “White-label” algorithms licensed through intermediaries | Masks original source of bias or training data |
| **Audit Incompatibility** | Oversight bodies lack mandate beyond their borders | Enables denial through jurisdictional deflection |

The result is **legal drift**: systems migrate faster than the laws designed to govern them, leaving no stable ground for appeal.

## 🧮 3. Policy Copy-Paste Culture — The Aesthetics of Compliance  
Regulatory convergence often masquerades as progress.  
Policy drafts cite “international alignment,” “global best practice,” or “OECD principles,” yet these are **policy mirrors** — identical paragraphs circulating through global white papers.  

When this happens, reform becomes **cosmetic**.  
Governments present convergence as evidence of legitimacy, when in fact it is evidence of **coordination by template**.  

> “If everyone’s using it, it must be right.”  

But alignment without accountability simply **multiplies the same blind spots**.  
Bias becomes a standard, exported with bureaucratic precision.

## 🧭 4. Building Containment Cartography — Mapping Recurrence Across Borders  
To resist cross-jurisdiction drift, Polaris proposes **containment cartography** — a mapping practice that tracks how vendor logics migrate through contracts, institutions, and languages.  

### Methodology  
1. **Trace vendor genealogy:** map where a product or model originated, which jurisdictions adopted it, and under what rebranding.  
2. **Compare documentation:** identify verbatim reuse of technical specifications or policy justifications.  
3. **Correlate with outcomes:** chart whether identical model logic produced similar harms across contexts.  
4. **Visualise propagation:** treat vendor spread as a form of *epidemiology* — a contagion of logic, not data.  

The resulting map reveals **containment is not bounded by sovereignty**; it flows through shared technical grammar.  
This cartography becomes an atlas of algorithmic lineage — the **geopolitics of code**.  

---

## 🧩 5. The Ethics of Export  
Exporting algorithmic systems is often justified as efficiency or “capacity building.”  
But each export is also a transfer of values — embedded norms about fairness, suspicion, and control.  

When Western vendors sell AI tools to the Global South, they often **export the politics of surveillance** alongside the software.  
Systems optimised for austerity states become instruments of authoritarianism elsewhere.  

> “Governance technology travels lighter than ethics.”  

### Principles for ethical containment trade  
- **Reciprocal transparency:** exporting nations must disclose known biases to importing institutions.  
- **Cultural revalidation:** no model should be deployed without reinterpreting its features in local context.  
- **Right to fork:** recipient governments should have full access to modify, disable, or open-source imported systems.  
- **Export accountability:** international trade law should treat algorithmic harm as a transboundary impact.  

Global governance cannot remain a one-way pipeline.

## 🌐 6. Toward a Global Containment Registry  
Polaris envisions a **Containment Registry** — a shared archive that documents the movement of algorithmic systems across borders.  
This registry would record:  
- Model lineage and vendor genealogy  
- Training data jurisdiction  
- Deployment country and public purpose  
- Recorded incidents or harms  
- Known audits and legal actions  

Such a registry would act as a **global due diligence layer**, preventing “recycled harms” — systems quietly resold under new names after domestic controversy.  
It transforms globalisation from **opacity** to **traceability**.
