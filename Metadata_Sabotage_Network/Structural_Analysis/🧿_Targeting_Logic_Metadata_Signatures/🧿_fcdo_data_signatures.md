*What the selection, structure, and handling of affected systems reveals — independent of attribution claims.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

When cyber incidents are publicly discussed, attention often collapses onto *who* is suspected.

CRAKEN analysis begins elsewhere.

This node examines **what was touched, probed, or prioritised** — and what those choices reveal about incentive, intent, and risk tolerance. These are **data signatures**, not tooling signatures. They are harder to fake and slower to decay.

Attribution may remain contested.  
Targeting logic does not.

## 🧿 What a Data Signature Is (and Is Not)

A data signature is **not**:
- malware provenance
- infrastructure reuse
- code similarity
- claimed affiliation

A data signature **is**:
- system selection
- data class prioritisation
- access depth vs breadth
- persistence behaviour
- tolerance for detection
- avoidance or attraction of specific datasets

CRAKEN rule:
> Tools can be borrowed. Incentives cannot.

---

## 🗂️ System Selection as Intent Signal

The involvement of FCDO systems immediately narrows the field of plausible objectives.

Key implications:
- these are **administrative gateways**, not battlefield systems
- they mediate movement, status, permission, and legitimacy
- they are high-impact with low visibility

Targeting such systems suggests interest in:
- bureaucratic leverage
- population filtering
- association mapping
- future coercion or pressure
- policy-adjacent harm rather than kinetic gain

This alone disfavours simplistic deterrence narratives.

---

## 📿 Data Class Prioritisation

Where available reporting indicates interest in:
- identity records
- visa or immigration data
- movement history
- application outcomes
- relational metadata

…the signature shifts further.

CRAKEN interpretation:
> Actors seeking operational disruption target infrastructure.  
> Actors seeking *downstream leverage* target administrative memory.

This aligns with:
- long-term influence
- delayed exploitation
- selective harm
- narrative utility

---

## ⏱️ Patience and Risk Tolerance

Data signature analysis considers *how* interaction occurred:

- absence of noisy disruption
- limited visible damage
- tolerance for latency
- acceptance of partial access

These indicate:
- low urgency
- expectation of future value
- comfort with delayed payoff

CRAKEN rule:
> High patience usually signals political or structural goals, not immediate extraction.

---

## 🔁 Relationship to Residual Shadows

FCDO data signatures are especially compatible with **residual shadow exploitation**:

- small datasets retain value
- inference improves over time
- future datasets enable re-correlation
- political shifts activate dormant leverage

This reinforces the assessment that:
> the primary risk profile is **temporal**, not immediate.

---

## ⚠️ Why Narrative Attribution Distorts Signature Reading

Once a familiar adversary narrative hardens:
- contradictory signals are ignored
- alternative actor classes drop out
- data selection is retrofitted to the story
- uncertainty is misread as weakness

CRAKEN warning:
> Narrative certainty collapses multidimensional signatures into single labels.

This is how misattribution persists even when evidence is thin.

---

## 🛑 What This Node Does *Not* Claim

This analysis does **not** assert:
- a specific actor
- a single motive
- a unified campaign
- inevitability of harm

It asserts something narrower and stronger:

> **The data selection itself constrains the plausible incentive space.**

Any attribution that ignores those constraints is analytically incomplete.

---

## 🧠 CRAKEN Integration

Within CRAKEN, data signatures function as **structural stress geometry**.

They:
- persist across narratives
- survive false flags
- inform protection priorities
- anchor analysis under uncertainty

They are the calcaneus lines you read *before* deciding where the pressure came from.

*🧿 FCDO Data Signatures* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It exists to preserve analytical integrity when attribution pressure is high and evidence remains partial.
