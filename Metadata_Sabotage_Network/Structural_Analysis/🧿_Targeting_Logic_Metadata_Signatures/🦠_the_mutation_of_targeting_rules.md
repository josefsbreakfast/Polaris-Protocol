*When yesterday’s exception becomes today’s rule.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
Every surveillance or moderation system evolves through quiet recalibration.  
A “temporary safeguard” introduced under crisis soon becomes a permanent parameter.  
This node examines how **signature drift** occurs — the process by which **targeting rules** mutate over time through human bias, vendor upgrades, or political shifts.  
Where policy claims stability, the codebase remembers each panic.

---

## 1. 🧨 Post-Crisis Tuning  
After scandals or terrorist incidents, the most visible change is not in law but in **classification weightings**.  
Risk thresholds are lowered; new keywords are added “for caution”; exceptions multiply.  
These patches rarely roll back.  
The model’s baseline subtly redefines “normal” until it encodes a permanent state of emergency.  
Public justification fades, but the code remains altered — a form of algorithmic muscle memory.  

---

## 2. 🔁 Vendor Update Cycles  
Commercial contractors perpetuate drift through **update incentives**.  
Every software revision promises improved detection or “responsiveness,” yet each release carries unseen epistemic edits:  
renamed variables, adjusted false-positive tolerances, and re-trained corpora aligned with client anxiety.  
What appears as technical maintenance is actually **policy delegation by proxy** — governance outsourced to release notes.  

---

## 3. 📣 Public Outrage → Silent Revision  
When public backlash exposes overreach, institutions rarely undo the mechanism.  
Instead, the visible symptom is renamed or re-weighted.  
Flagged terms become “contextually aware”; detention lists are folded into “watch” rather than “block” categories.  
Outrage is metabolised into version control.  
The next crisis begins from this new floor — what was once exception now qualifies as precedent.  

---

## 4. 🕰️ Monitoring Drift Over Time  
Drift is detectable only through **temporal comparison**.  
To map it, one must archive every configuration file, every API schema, every list of indicators — a near-impossible task given proprietary secrecy.  
Yet forensic traces remain: sudden spikes in false positives, newly correlated risk attributes, or unexplained re-training events.  
The ethics of drift monitoring therefore mirror environmental science: we study pollution after its dispersal.

*🦠 Signature Drift — The Mutation of Targeting Rules* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how “temporary measures” harden into enduring containment architectures through incremental technical change.
