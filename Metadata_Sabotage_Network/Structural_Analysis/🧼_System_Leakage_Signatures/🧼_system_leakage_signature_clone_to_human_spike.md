# 🧼 System leakage signature: clone → human spike  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*A diagnostic pattern where technical archiving precedes human review.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents a recurring **system leakage signature** observed in public repositories and open documentation platforms:  
a **spike in cloning activity followed by a later spike in human views**.

This pattern indicates a shift from automated or technical review into broader human scrutiny, often triggered by perceived governance, legal, or reputational relevance.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Clone activity preceding human readership  
- Low unique users with high repeat views  
- Archival behaviour before circulation  
- Evidence of internal routing before attention  
- Indicative of risk review, not popularity

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. What the clone → human sequence indicates  

In most organic attention patterns, human views precede downloads or cloning.  
The inverse sequence suggests:

> **“We need a stable copy of this before we discuss it.”**

Cloning first signals:
- archiving  
- offline review  
- internal circulation  
- or preservation before change  

---

### 2. Why systems clone before reading  

Clones are typically initiated by:
- technical staff  
- compliance teams  
- governance analysts  
- researchers conducting review  

Human readers usually arrive later, once:
- links are shared internally  
- summaries circulate  
- or the material is flagged as relevant

### 3. Leakage vs suppression  

This signature does **not** imply suppression.

Instead, it reflects **leakage**:
the moment private institutional attention spills into observable public metrics.

The system has noticed something — and its noticing leaves a trace.

---

### 4. Why this matters  

The clone → human spike pattern is valuable because it is:
- non-invasive  
- behaviourally legible  
- independent of intent  

It shows **attention migration**, not motive.

*System leakage signature: clone → human spike* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how institutional attention becomes visible through platform analytics before formal engagement occurs.
