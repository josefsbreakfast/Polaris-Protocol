## 🧭 What This Node Is About  

R&D artefact leakage describes a systemic failure mode in which **experimental models, datasets, embeddings, or assumptions developed for research purposes are reused — intentionally or accidentally — in production systems** without adequate revalidation, governance, or consent review.

This is not a rare oversight.  
It is a structural outcome of how modern ML systems are built, iterated, and shipped.

The result is that **exploratory artefacts gain real-world power**, often long after their original context has been forgotten.

---

## 🧱 What Counts as an R&D Artefact  

R&D artefacts include, but are not limited to:

- prototype models  
- pilot embeddings  
- experimental clustering geometry  
- internal evaluation datasets  
- proof-of-concept pipelines  
- feature engineering assumptions  
- heuristic labels used “temporarily”  
- synthetic or semi-synthetic data  
- early-stage safety or risk classifiers  

These artefacts are legitimate *inside* R&D.  
They become problematic when treated as production-grade.

---

## 🔁 How Leakage Happens  

R&D artefact leakage usually occurs through ordinary workflows:

- a prototype model “works well enough” and is reused  
- an embedding space becomes a dependency for another service  
- a research classifier is wrapped by a product feature  
- a pilot dataset is reused to bootstrap training  
- a temporary heuristic becomes permanent by inertia  
- documentation is lost as teams change  
- ownership of the artefact becomes unclear  

No malice is required.  
Only momentum.

---

## 🚨 Why R&D Artefacts Are Especially Risky  

R&D artefacts differ from production assets in critical ways.

They are often:

- trained on small or biased samples  
- overfitted to niche behaviours  
- optimised for insight, not fairness  
- unconcerned with consent scope  
- loosely documented  
- weakly audited  
- intentionally sensitive to edge cases  

When these artefacts leak into production, their **exploratory sensitivity is mistaken for reliability**.

---

## 👻 Interaction with Sparse Clusters and Ghost Geometry  

R&D artefact leakage is a primary source of:

- micro-clusters  
- frozen centroids  
- exaggerated similarity  
- legacy embedding spaces  

If an R&D dataset contained:
- only a handful of users  
- a narrow behavioural slice  
- internal staff or testers  

…the resulting geometry may encode clusters of size 1–3.

When that geometry persists downstream, it creates the illusion of meaningful grouping where none exists.

---

## 🕳️ Why This Leakage Often Goes Unnoticed  

Organisations rarely notice R&D artefact leakage because:

- the system appears to function  
- metrics do not immediately degrade  
- artefacts are abstracted behind APIs  
- no one remembers the original context  
- responsibility is diffuse  
- users cannot see the source of inference  

From the outside, the behaviour looks intentional.  
From the inside, it looks like legacy code.

---

## ⚖️ Interaction with Consent and Purpose Limitation  

A critical governance failure occurs when:

- data collected for research is reused operationally  
- experimental inference becomes user-facing  
- consent boundaries are exceeded silently  
- special category inference is inherited by downstream systems  

Even if the original R&D use was lawful or internal,  
**reuse without renewed legal basis is not**.

R&D artefact leakage often bypasses consent review entirely because the artefact is treated as “technical,” not as data processing.

---

## 🚫 Why “It Was Just a Prototype” Is Not a Defence  

Once an artefact influences:

- user experience  
- classification  
- moderation  
- reputation  
- risk assessment  
- behavioural steering  

…it is no longer a prototype.

Intent does not determine impact.  
Deployment does.

Treating research artefacts as harmless because they were never meant for production obscures the real issue: **they are now operating on people**.

---

## 🧨 When R&D Leakage Becomes Harmful  

R&D artefact leakage becomes harmful when it:

- embeds unvalidated assumptions into live systems  
- amplifies sparse cluster effects  
- sustains outdated interpretations  
- enables proxy-based sensitive inference  
- affects individuals without transparency or recourse  

At this point, the problem is not technical debt.  
It is **unauthorised inference at scale**.

---

## 🛠️ What Proper Containment Requires  

Preventing R&D artefact leakage requires:

- strict separation between research and production pipelines  
- explicit artefact lifecycle management  
- consent and purpose revalidation before reuse  
- sunset clauses for experimental models  
- documentation of provenance and assumptions  
- auditability of embedding origins  
- governance review before promotion to production  

Absent these controls, leakage is the default outcome.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway  

> **Research artefacts are hypotheses.  
Production systems treat them as facts.**

Without deliberate containment, exploratory tools quietly become instruments of power.

*🧪 R&D Artefact Leakage into Production* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, documenting how experimental ML artefacts escape their intended context and shape real-world systems without adequate validation, consent, or governance.

This node situates leakage as an **organisational failure**, not an accident — and a primary source of downstream harm in behavioural modelling.
