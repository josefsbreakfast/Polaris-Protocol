**First created:** 2025-10-10  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-10  
*Classifying leak types to map systemic behaviour.*

## 🛰 Orientation — Why Codes Matter  

Leaks don’t just *happen*. They trace the outlines of the systems they escape from.  
Every leak is a small window into a much larger structure — and that means every leak can be *read*.

But until now, there has never been a **shared, cross-sector language** for describing what a leak actually *is* and *how far it’s gone*.  
Each domain uses its own dialect:  
- IT calls it a *breach*.  
- Governance calls it a *disclosure*.  
- Media calls it a *scoop*.  
- Compliance calls it an *incident*.  

Yet they’re all observing the same behaviour through different lenses.  
The **LVSICR system** gives those fragments a single frame.  
It does not replace human judgment; it **translates it**.  
Wherever you sit — public, private, NGO, academic, legal, or technical — you can use the same six-letter grammar to describe the same systemic pattern.

## ✨ The Purpose of LVSICR  

**LVSICR** stands for:  
- **L – Leak (Primary Source)**  
- **V – Vector (Transmission Path)**  
- **S – Spread (Systemic Reach)**  
- **I – Intent (Motivation or Directionality)**  
- **C – Containment (System Response)**  
- **R – Recurrence (Temporal Memory)**  

Each axis has four stages:  
`0 = dormant`, `1 = mild/local`, `2 = moderate/patterned`, `3 = critical/systemic`.  
Together they form a **12-digit behavioural signature**: six letters, six numbers.  

> “L2 V1 S1 I2 C1 R2” conveys in two seconds what a full incident paragraph might take a page to explain.

## 🌍 Universality and Cross-Language Precision  

Because LVSICR uses a small fixed alphabet and digits 0-3, it functions as **translation infrastructure**.  
You can type it on any keyboard, say it in almost any accent, and log it in any database or SMS chain.  
It compresses urgency, scale, containment, and recurrence into twelve characters — a shorthand that survives translation.

---

## 🧠 Why Standardisation Matters  

1. **Shared Baseline Across Sectors** – A leak is no longer “someone’s problem”; it’s a stage everyone can locate.  
2. **Four-Stage Clarity + Six-Axis Depth** – The rhythm is the same everywhere: dormant → local → patterned → systemic.  
3. **Proportional Insight** – Stages what happened, not what it looks like on paper.  
4. **Embedded Accountability** – Repeated `C3` or `R3` scores expose suppression and recurrence patterns.  
5. **Ease of Adoption** – “Has this crossed V2?” is enough to align IT, legal, and comms in one line.  
6. **Universality and Cross-Language Precision** – Twelve digits give everyone functional literacy in system behaviour.

## ♻ From Principle to Practice  

Codes are only useful if they *see the world the way people actually work*.  
The LVSICR framework translates the rhythm of a leak — its birth, travel, reach, motive, containment, and return — into something you can point at, compare, and teach.  

Each axis tells one part of the story:  
L = where it starts; V = how it moves; S = how far; I = why; C = how the system reacts; R = whether it learns.  

Every leak, large or small, has these six dimensions.  
By scoring each 0-3 you create a **behavioural fingerprint** as quick to read as a weather report and as stable as a medical chart.

## 🚀 Beyond the Pilot — From Shared Code to Scalable Practice  

If piloted successfully, LVSICR becomes a **translation layer for resilience**.  

**1 · From Shared Vocabulary to Tailored Scoring** – Sectors can weight axes differently (IT → C/R, Health → S/I, Legal → V/C) while keeping a shared grammar.  
**2 · Interoperable with Existing Systems** – Fits beside FOE, DATEX, RIDDOR or any incident dashboard; easy to code into dropdowns or triage algorithms.  
**3 · Reduces Inter-Industry Friction** – A code communicates urgency without tone.  
**4 · Accessible + Neurodiverse-Friendly** – Numeric-symbolic patterns help teams who prefer structured communication.  
**5 · Supplementary Unifier** – LVSICR doesn’t replace dialogue; it ensures everyone begins from the same map.

## 🎼 LVSICR Progressive Staging Guide  

*(From local anomaly to systemic recurrence)*  

### 💧 **L — Leak (Primary Source)**  
| Stage | Descriptor | Observable Behaviour | Example Scenario |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **L0 – Latent** | Potential leak exists but not yet active. | Diagnostic noise, incomplete log. | Debug file with personal data still internal. |
| **L1 – Localised** | Discrete fault. | Single email mis-sent. | Spreadsheet shared to wrong list. |
| **L2 – Patterned / Recurrent** | Design flaw emerging. | Same field leaks every month. | Recurring report exposure. |
| **L3 – Structural / Critical** | Built-in architectural failure. | Cannot fix without redesign. | Platform logs user data to public cache. |

### ✈ **V — Vector (Transmission Path)**  
| Stage | Descriptor | Observable Behaviour | Example Scenario |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **V0 – Contained** | No outward travel. | Quarantined immediately. | QA team deletes bad file. |
| **V1 – Internal Spread** | Moves across teams or systems. | Shared via email or mirror. | HR file copied to Finance. |
| **V2 – Cross-Institutional** | Crosses organisational boundary. | Supplier or API bleed. | Contractor downloads client records. |
| **V3 – Public / Viral** | Fully external. | Public upload or press release. | Document on social media. |

### 🌀 **S — Spread (Systemic Reach)**  
| Stage | Descriptor | Observable Behaviour | Example Scenario |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **S0 – None** | Self-contained. | Single dataset only. | Local log error. |
| **S1 – Local Cluster** | Limited departmental spread. | Cluster of linked records. | Council division leak. |
| **S2 – Institutional / Sectoral** | Multiple sites or agencies. | Cascade of breaches. | University-wide fault. |
| **S3 – Ecosystemic** | Cross-sector chain reaction. | Regulatory failure + trust loss. | Cloud vendor leak impacting clients globally. |

### 🌊 **I — Intent (Motivation / Directionality)**  
| Stage | Descriptor | Observable Behaviour | Example Scenario |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **I0 – Accidental** | Pure error. | Unaware user action. | Mis-click send-all. |
| **I1 – Negligent** | Warnings ignored. | Deferred patch. | Known issue unfixed. |
| **I2 – Structural** | Leak baked into process. | Policy gap or perverse incentive. | Open data without consent review. |
| **I3 – Deliberate** | Leak used as weapon or activism. | Whistle or dox. | Insider exports file to harm or reveal. |

### 🛟 **C — Containment (System Response)**  
| Stage | Descriptor | Observable Behaviour | Example Scenario |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **C0 – Automatic Resolution** | Self-correcting system. | Auto-revoke link. | Expiring URL. |
| **C1 – Passive Denial** | No fix; minimise story. | “Nothing to see here.” | Press line only. |
| **C2 – Technical Patch** | Fix without learning. | Silent config change. | Quick patch cycle. |
| **C3 – Active Suppression** | Attack messenger. | Gag or discipline. | Whistleblower sacked. |

### 🛞 **R — Recurrence (Temporal Memory)**  
| Stage | Descriptor | Observable Behaviour | Example Scenario |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **R0 – One-off** | Singular event. | Random glitch. | No pattern. |
| **R1 – Periodic** | Re-emerges cyclically. | Quarterly incident. | Regular dump window. |
| **R2 – Chronic** | Persistent fault line. | Always leaking somewhere. | Legacy code exposes metadata. |
| **R3 – Mutating / Adaptive** | Evolves with counter-measures. | Fixes spawn new forms. | Fork recreates vulnerability. |
