*Policy diffs as confessions of drift.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Policies rarely announce their contradictions; they reveal them in their changelogs.  
Each amendment, redraft, or “clarification” tells a story of negotiation between legal caution, political optics, and administrative fatigue.  
By treating version history as evidence, auditors can read **contradiction as confession** — a visible seam where containment logic adjusts itself to survive scrutiny.

## 📑 Key Sections  

### 1. Diff Forensics  
Policy revision tracking transforms every edit into metadata testimony.  
Running textual diffs across sequential versions exposes:  
- Silent deletions of accountability clauses.  
- Shifting definitions of “reasonable steps” or “exceptional circumstances.”  
- Inserted qualifiers (“where practicable,” “subject to available resources”).  
- Retroactive timestamp edits that imply post-hoc justification.  

Each diff is a micro-trial between what the institution once promised and what it can now sustain.  

> *When policy begins to argue with its own past, drift has become doctrine.*

### 2. Version Control Ethics  
Governments often publish “latest versions” without retaining accessible archives.  
This practice converts history into PR: only the current truth is searchable.  
Ethical policy management requires:  
- Immutable repositories with public diff history.  
- Digital signatures for each release.  
- Mandatory citation of superseded sections in explanatory memoranda.  
- Clear record of *who authorised change* and *why*.  

Without such transparency, version control becomes version concealment.

### 3. Contradiction as Disclosure  
Contradictions are not administrative mistakes — they are the *syntax of adjustment*.  
Tracking them allows analysts to infer the pressures acting on a department:  
- Sudden reversals signal litigation or media exposure.  
- Gradual softening hints at lobbying or budget contraction.  
- Introduced ambiguity often precedes privatisation or outsourcing.  

By mapping these narrative shifts, auditors can reconstruct the invisible politics behind each “minor update.”

### 4. Public Archiving Methods  
Auditors and journalists can operationalise contradiction mapping through:  
1. **Automated version diff tools** (Git, PolicyDiff, DocumentCloud) with public commit logs.  
2. **Timestamp triangulation** — cross-checking policy upload times against press releases.  
3. **Crowd-archiving** via distributed repositories to prevent retroactive deletion.  
4. **Visual diff exhibits** — colour-coded contradictions used in hearings or inquiries.  

Public archiving turns bureaucratic self-argument into a public record of learning — or denial.
