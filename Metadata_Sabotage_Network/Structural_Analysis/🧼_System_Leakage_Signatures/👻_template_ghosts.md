*When boilerplate forgets to hide its maker.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Templates are ghosts with form fields.  
Each policy framework, contract, or press statement begins life as a reusable shell: a matrix of placeholders, comments, and conditional text that promises efficiency but leaks identity.  
When editors forget to strip the scaffolding, the leftover fragments — “\[insert justification here\]”, “\[check with Legal\]”, or “\[tone soften for public\]” — expose the backstage of institutional authorship.  
This node treats template residue as documentary confession.

## 📑 Key Sections  

### 1. Anatomy of a Template Slip  
Template ghosts appear when drafting software retains *comment fields, macro notes, or un-rendered variables.*  
Typical traces include:  
- Hidden track-changes comments left in PDFs.  
- Placeholder syntax such as `{{department_name}}` or `$[Insert Clause]`.  
- Formatting cues like “(H3 style)” or “END OF SECTION – DO NOT PUBLISH”.  
- Metadata links to shared drives revealing internal folder structures.  

Every artefact is a breadcrumb of the workflow that produced it — a forensic sample of bureaucratic voice.

### 2. Placeholder Taxonomies  
| Type | Example | Implication |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Instructional** | \[Insert statistics from last quarter\] | Document assembled from modular template. |
| **Legalistic** | \[Check with counsel re: liability phrasing\] | Indicates pending internal review. |
| **Editorial** | “Tone: assertive but apologetic.” | Reveals framing strategy or media sensitivity. |
| **Technical** | `${variable.department}` | Suggests automated generation via CMS or CRM. |
| **Cultural** | “(delete if ministerial sign-off pending)” | Shows internal hierarchy of approval. |

Building a placeholder taxonomy helps map the grammar of containment: the language used to hide labour.

### 3. Revision History Leaks  
Version control systems embed invisible *comment anchors* even after visible markup is removed.  
Recovered fragments often include user IDs, timestamps, and thread chains linking multiple reviewers.  
When aligned chronologically, they reconstruct an unintentional oral history — how drafts evolved, what dissent was silenced, which voices overruled others.  
For investigators, this is the living echo of **Behavioural Forks** inside a single file.

### 4. Cleaning Without Erasure  
Ethical remediation aims to protect individuals while preserving institutional accountability.  
**Do:**  
- Flatten tracked changes and delete comment layers *before* PDF export.  
- Preserve an authenticated copy of the unclean file under secure access.  
- Use document-forensics tools (exiftool, strings, docx4j) to confirm removal.  
**Don’t:**  
- Rewrite metadata histories; record cleaning actions in an external log.  
- Destroy original timestamps — they are part of provenance.  

Transparency survives only when ghosts are acknowledged, not exorcised.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Template Ghosts — Boilerplate Left Behind* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol.**  
It treats editorial residue as confession, revealing the human scaffolding that official language tries to forget.
