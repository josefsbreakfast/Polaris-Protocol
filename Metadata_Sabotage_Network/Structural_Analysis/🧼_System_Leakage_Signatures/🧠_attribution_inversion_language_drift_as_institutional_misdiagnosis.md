*Language drift as institutional misdiagnosis.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Institutions recycle language.  
Clinical or behavioural descriptors first applied to one person — “manipulative,” “obsessive,” “attention-seeking” — can silently transfer to another through notes, training data, or shared metadata.  
This is **attribution inversion**: the moment when another person’s diagnostic frame becomes your reputation.  

The effect is profound.  
It converts historical record into personality, and personality into containment logic.

## ⚙️ Mechanism of Inversion  

| Phase | Trigger | Example | Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1️⃣ Proximity of records** | Victim and offender records stored in shared schema. | Prison health and community case notes cross-referenced. | Adjectives bleed between files. |
| **2️⃣ Semantic reuse** | Staff reuse templated phrasing. | “Displays controlling behaviour” pasted into wrong profile. | False continuity of character. |
| **3️⃣ Narrative migration** | Descriptive tone imported into institutional summaries. | Media or academic reporting uses same adjectives. | Label gains authority. |
| **4️⃣ Feedback consolidation** | New actors read the inherited file. | HR, ethics, or safeguarding panels rely on descriptors. | Original error gains procedural life. |

The word outlives its speaker — and changes ownership.

## 🪞 Governance Interpretation  

- **Attribution inversion is narrative laundering.**  
  It moves stigma without altering the dataset.  
- **Institutional empathy decays linguistically:** care language becomes control language.  
- **Correction requires confession:** acknowledging that descriptors are not neutral metadata but living cultural artefacts.  

---

## 🧰 Corrective Strategies  

1. **Lexical lineage audit** — trace origin of recurring descriptors across record sets.  
2. **Descriptor quarantine** — flag inherited adjectives for contextual review.  
3. **Semantic timestamping** — append “first use” and “source” metadata to qualitative fields.  
4. **Counter-narrative footnotes** — attach survivor commentary to institutional language.  
5. **Linguistic parity review** — compare adjectives applied to different roles in same incident.

## 🧮 Example: The “Manipulative” Tag  

| Context | Original Use | Inverted Use | Governance Effect |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Clinical** | “Displays manipulative behaviour” (patient, male offender). | “Manipulative” descriptor reused for complainant. | Victim credibility reduced. |
| **Academic** | “Difficult to supervise” (staff misconduct report). | “Overly assertive” (student complaint). | Role inversion reframed as personality flaw. |
