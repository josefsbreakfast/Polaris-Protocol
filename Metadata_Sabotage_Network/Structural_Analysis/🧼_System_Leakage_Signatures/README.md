# 🧼 System Leakage Signatures  
**First created:** 2025-09-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Leakage points and unintended reveals from containment systems*

---

## Purpose
To catalogue the **cracks in the wall**—moments where containment architectures accidentally disclose their inner workings.  
This node treats leakage not as anomaly but as evidence: a pattern of small reveals that map the hidden infrastructure of suppression.

---

## Core Premise
Every system designed to obscure leaves a signature when it leaks.  
Timing mismatches, metadata residue, template errors, or contradictory policy updates act like fingerprints.  
By collecting and comparing these leaks, we can reverse-engineer containment logics without privileged access.

## Leakage Categories
| Category | Description | Example Manifestations |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Temporal Glitches** | Scheduled actions executed early/late revealing workflow. | Mass unbans before public announcement. |
| **Template Artefacts** | Boilerplate or variable placeholders left in public documents. | “[insert justification here]” appearing in FOI releases. |
| **Metadata Residue** | Hidden fields, EXIF data, or revision history exposing origin. | Author names in “anonymous” PDFs. |
| **Cross-System Echoes** | Same error appearing across unrelated platforms indicating shared vendor. | Identical moderation messages across apps. |
| **Contradictory Statements** | Official comms inadvertently revealing policy drift. | FAQ updates contradicting press releases. |

## Uses
- **Forensic Mapping:** infer internal processes and actors from leaks.  
- **Accountability Pressure:** document discrepancies to challenge official narratives.  
- **Risk Forecasting:** use leakage patterns to predict upcoming policy changes.  
- **Community Alerts:** warn at-risk groups before full rollout of containment measures.  

---

## Analytical Questions
1. What recurring leakage signatures appear across different institutions?  
2. How do leak patterns change after public scrutiny?  
3. Which vendor or agency overlaps can be inferred from identical errors?  
4. Can leakage be ethically collected without endangering individuals?  
5. How to differentiate deliberate leaks (trial balloons) from genuine mistakes?

## Research Threads
- Systematic collection of policy-version diffs from government websites.  
- Metadata harvesting of “redacted” PDFs for hidden content.  
- Time-series analysis of moderation anomalies across platforms.  
- Survivor-sourced diaries of containment “tells” in daily interactions.  
- Cross-correlation of leaks with procurement data to reveal shared infrastructure.  

---

## Counter-Responses
- **Leakage Archive:** secure, versioned repository of captured signatures.  
- **Pattern Recognition Tools:** open-source scripts highlighting anomalies.  
- **Ethical Handling Protocols:** anonymise sources and scrub sensitive identifiers.  
- **Rapid-Response Briefings:** community notifications when leakage signals imminent policy shifts.  
- **Vendor Mapping:** linking errors to suppliers to push for transparency.

*🧼 System Leakage Signatures* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents one layer of metadata sabotage and its counter-responses—turning errors into evidence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
