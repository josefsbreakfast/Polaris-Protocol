*How internal testing practices create distorted behavioural models that later affect real users*

---

## What this node is about

Internal dogfooding refers to the practice of employees using their own organisation’s products, tools, or experimental systems during development and testing.

In principle, dogfooding is sensible.
In practice, it introduces a **highly specific and under-governed risk** in behavioural modelling systems.

When data generated by internal users is used to train, calibrate, or structure models that later operate on the public, **internal behaviour becomes a silent reference population**.

This node documents how that happens, and why it matters.

---

## What makes dogfooding data structurally different

Internal users are not representative users.

They are more likely to:

- understand system intent and internals  
- deliberately test edge cases  
- use features intensely or atypically  
- generate high-context, high-density data  
- behave strategically rather than naturally  
- share professional norms and workflows  
- cluster tightly in behavioural space  

As a result, dogfooding datasets are **dense, narrow, and skewed**.

They are useful for testing.
They are dangerous as baselines.

---

## How dogfooding becomes a modelling input

Dogfooding data becomes operational when it is used to:

- generate early embeddings  
- define cluster boundaries  
- calibrate anomaly detection  
- tune proxy thresholds  
- shape recommendation geometry  
- train safety or moderation heuristics  
- “bootstrap” models before scale  

At this stage, the internal cohort is no longer just testing.
It is **defining normality**.

---

## Why dogfooding creates micro-clusters

Because dogfooding populations are small and behaviourally similar, they often produce:

- extremely tight clusters  
- sharp boundaries  
- exaggerated similarity  
- strong centroids  
- minimal internal variance  

If only two or three internal users exhibit a certain behaviour pattern, the model may encode that pattern as a **distinct behavioural region**.

When external users later resemble that pattern, they are mapped into a space that was never designed for them.

---

## Interaction with embedding inertia

Dogfooding artefacts persist because:

- early embeddings are reused  
- cluster geometry becomes foundational  
- later data is mapped onto existing space  
- retraining preserves initial structure  
- no explicit “dogfooding purge” occurs  

Even when the original internal users stop generating data, the **shape they created remains**.

This is how internal behaviour echoes outward long after the testing phase ends.

---

## Why this failure is rarely documented

Dogfooding risks are often invisible because:

- internal testing is considered benign  
- datasets are assumed to be temporary  
- artefacts are labelled “technical”  
- consent frameworks treat employees differently  
- model lineage is poorly tracked  
- success metrics ignore representativeness  

As a result, dogfooding influence is rarely disclosed — even internally.

---

## Interaction with consent and power asymmetry

Dogfooding raises specific consent concerns:

- employees may not meaningfully consent to downstream reuse  
- power dynamics complicate refusal  
- data may be repurposed beyond original scope  
- experimental inference may affect non-employees later  

When dogfooding data shapes public-facing systems, **employee data indirectly governs others**.

This is a non-obvious but serious ethical issue.

---

## When dogfooding becomes harmful

Dogfooding becomes harmful when:

- internal behaviour defines behavioural “types”  
- sparse internal clusters persist in production  
- proxy misinterpretation is calibrated on employees  
- external users are assessed against internal norms  
- misclassification feels personal or uncanny  
- individuals have no visibility into the source of inference  

At this point, the system is no longer testing itself.
It is projecting itself onto others.

---

## What responsible containment requires

Responsible handling of dogfooding requires:

- explicit labelling of internal datasets  
- hard separation from production training  
- mandatory retraining on representative data  
- removal of internal embeddings before deployment  
- consent clarity for employee data  
- audit trails for artefact provenance  
- sunset clauses on dogfooding influence  

Without these measures, dogfooding becomes a silent design authority.

---

## Key takeaway

> **Dogfooding does not just test systems.  
It teaches systems what “normal” looks like.**

If that lesson is not unlearned before deployment, everyone else inherits it.

*Internal Dogfooding as a Risk Vector* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, documenting how internal testing practices quietly shape behavioural models and why this influence becomes harmful when left unexamined in production systems.

This node frames dogfooding not as misuse, but as a **powerful and under-governed modelling input**.
