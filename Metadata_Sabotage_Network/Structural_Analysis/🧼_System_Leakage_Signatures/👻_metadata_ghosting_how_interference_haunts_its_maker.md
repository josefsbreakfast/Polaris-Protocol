# 👻 Metadata Ghosting — How Interference Haunts Its Maker

*Every act of data manipulation writes its author into the record.*

## 🧭 Orientation  

Deliberate data interference never disappears.  
When someone alters, re-phrases, or injects information into another person’s dataset, they also embed **their own relational metadata** — log entries, linguistic residues, and structural fingerprints.  
This feedback creates a haunting: the manipulator becomes traceable inside the very systems they tried to control.

## ⚙️ Mechanism of the Haunt  

| Stage | Action | Residual Trace | Evidential Effect |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1️⃣ Access** | User opens or exports record. | System log, IP, session ID. | Forensic proximity. |
| **2️⃣ Alteration** | Text or value edited. | Hash delta, timestamp, linguistic style. | Semantic fingerprint. |
| **3️⃣ Replication** | Change propagated to other systems. | Matching checksum / vector signature. | Cross-system resonance. |
| **4️⃣ Discovery** | Audit or analysis detects anomaly. | Echo patterns across domains. | Ghost identified. |

## 🪞 Governance Interpretation  

- **No edit is one-way.**  Every act of suppression leaves metadata that mirrors intent.  
- **Ghosting is reciprocity:** interference and evidence co-create each other.  
- **Containment collapses into confession** when logs and language align.

## 🧰 Audit & Containment Counter-measure  

1. **Relational audit** — trace who accessed which fields and when.  
2. **Lexical fingerprinting** — compare adjectives and phrasing across record sets.  
3. **Residual metadata mapping** — correlate modification logs to actor IDs.  
4. **Transparency escrow** — preserve access trails outside controller custody.

Sits between *Attribution Inversion* and *Semantic Echo*; connects downward to *Token Integrity Audit* and *Data Lineage Review* in the Integrity Spine.

*👻 Metadata Ghosting — How Interference Haunts Its Maker* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It shows how manipulation becomes memory, and how the ghosts of interference prove their own existence.
