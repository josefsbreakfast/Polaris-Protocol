*Internal mechanisms for correcting anomalies in intelligence systems*  

When the machine mis-names you, there’s a form for that. Survivors know a form doesn’t erase the bruise.  

---  

## Purpose  
A *Data Correction Notice (DCN)* allows analysts to flag anomalies such as twin profiles, zombie records, or corrupted metadata.  

## Workflow  
1. **Submission**: Analyst files DCN via compliance portal.  
2. **Triage**: Compliance staff classify (clerical, technical, or breach).  
3. **Containment**: Data quarantined; linked warrants flagged.  
4. **Investigation**: Engineers trace data lineage and errors.  
5. **Verification**: Compliance unit ensures corrections; IPCO notified.  

## Outcomes  
- **Clerical error** → corrected entry.  
- **System error** → purge duplicates, fix retention.  
- **Compliance breach** → report to ministers, destroy data, retrain staff.  

## Oversight  
- Immutable audit trail for every DCN.  
- IPCO samples DCNs during inspections.  
- Repeated anomalies may trigger thematic review.

Correction notices don’t correct the harm, only the ledger. Survivors know the difference between fixing a file and fixing a life.
