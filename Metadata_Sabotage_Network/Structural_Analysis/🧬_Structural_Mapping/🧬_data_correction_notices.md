*Internal mechanisms for correcting anomalies in intelligence systems.*

## 🧭 Orientation  
When the machine mis-names you, there’s a form for that.  
Survivors know a form doesn’t erase the bruise.  

This node describes how *Data Correction Notices (DCNs)* operate within surveillance and intelligence infrastructures — the bureaucratic gesture of apology that fixes metadata, not memory.  

---

## 🧩 1. Purpose  
A **Data Correction Notice (DCN)** allows analysts or compliance staff to flag anomalies such as twin profiles, zombie records, or corrupted metadata within live or archived datasets.  
It is both a control mechanism and an audit artefact: proof that the system can “see its own error.”  

---

## 🔄 2. Workflow  

| Stage | Action | Responsible Unit |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **1 — Submission** | Analyst files DCN via compliance portal, attaching identifiers and evidence. | Originating department |
| **2 — Triage** | Compliance classifies anomaly as clerical, technical, or breach. | Compliance team |
| **3 — Containment** | Data quarantined; any linked warrants or workflows flagged. | System administrator |
| **4 — Investigation** | Engineers trace data lineage and determine replication source. | Data engineering |
| **5 — Verification** | Compliance ensures correction integrity; IPCO notified if statutory data involved. | Oversight liaison |

---

## 🧮 3. Outcomes  

| Category | Result | Typical Remedy |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Clerical Error** | Corrected entry; minor internal log. | Metadata update. |
| **System Error** | Duplicate or retention fault corrected. | Purge & patch cycle. |
| **Compliance Breach** | Report to ministers, destroy data, retrain staff. | Formal incident review. |

---

## 🧠 4. Oversight  

- Each DCN generates an **immutable audit trail** with timestamps and operator IDs.  
- The **Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO)** samples DCNs during inspections.  
- **Repeated anomalies** may trigger a thematic review of system reliability or vendor performance.  

> Correction notices don’t correct the harm — only the ledger.  
> Survivors know the difference between fixing a file and fixing a life.
