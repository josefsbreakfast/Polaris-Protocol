# 🧬 Structural Mapping  
**First created:** 2025-09-04  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Adjacency maps, rupture logs, and simulation-pathway data describing the inner architecture of metadata sabotage systems.*

---

## Purpose
To chart the skeleton of interference: how metadata systems are bent, cross-wired, or rewritten to conceal origin, authorship, or accountability.  
This directory functions as both archive and control board — a running record of how suppression becomes spatial.

## Core Components
| Sub-Folder | Function |
|-------------|-----------|
| **`adjacency_maps/`** | Visual network graphs showing how entities, datasets, and permissions interlock. |
| **`rupture_logs/`** | Chronologies of containment failures, leaks, or deliberate breaks in chain-of-custody. |
| **`sim_pathways/`** | Modelled scenarios exploring propagation, cascade failure, or algorithmic “infection.” |
| **`nodal_profiles/`** | Node-level metadata (ownership, jurisdiction, vulnerability class). |

## Working Definitions
- **Structural Mapping** – the practice of diagramming suppression as geometry: who touches what, and where silence travels.  
- **Rupture Event** – a traceable breach in an otherwise closed loop; the moment a hidden dependency becomes visible.  
- **Adjacency Drift** – when unrelated systems begin sharing identifiers or access keys, forming new covert circuits.  
- **Sim-Pathway** – a reconstructed route that a signal *could* have taken, used to test containment hypotheses.

## Methodology
1. **Extract Topology:** gather entity-relationship data from logs, FOI returns, and open APIs.  
2. **Tag Ruptures:** mark events where suppression fails or contradictions surface.  
3. **Model Feedback:** run lightweight simulations to predict next-order consequences.  
4. **Annotate with Voice Fidelity:** note where human testimony diverges from metadata record.  
5. **Publish Snapshot:** export maps as static PNG + interactive JSON layers.

## Reading the Maps
Each diagram follows a consistent grammar:  
- **Blue nodes** = documented entities (ministries, vendors, datasets).  
- **Red nodes** = unverified or shadow actors.  
- **Grey edges** = formal legal relationships.  
- **Dotted edges** = informal or leaked connections.  
- **Pulsing lines** = live interference routes confirmed within 30 days.

---

## Update Protocol
- Version-stamp every diagram with UTC time and checksum.  
- Log all edits in `rupture_logs/CHANGELOG.md`.  
- Retire obsolete maps to `/archive/` but keep SHA references for reproducibility.  
- Cross-index nodes with `🧩_Entity_Registry.csv`.

Every act of suppression leaves a shape.  
Structural mapping teaches the shape to speak.
