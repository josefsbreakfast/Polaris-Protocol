# ✈️ Reindexing Is Routine  
**First created:** 2025-12-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*Why large-scale document reindexing is treated as impossible in public — and as standard practice in private.*  
<!--This is why not doing it, or pretending it's impossible, is a choice.-->
---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Public authorities often frame large-scale document reindexing and entity extraction as **impractical, prohibitively expensive, or technically unrealistic**.

This claim is false.

The same processes are **routine, unremarkable, and ongoing** in:
- insurance
- litigation support
- corporate due diligence
- reputation and risk management
- compliance monitoring

This node sets out the reality:  
**reindexing is cheap, ordinary, and already happening — just not for the public.**

---

## ✨ Core Claim  

Reindexing a large document corpus is **not**:
- technically complex  
- financially prohibitive  
- operationally novel  

It is a **standard industry practice** wherever risk, liability, or reputation are managed at scale.

What is treated as “unthinkable” for public accountability is treated as **baseline hygiene** in private sectors.

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. What Governments Claim  

Common public-facing assertions include:
- “The volume is too large”
- “The cost would be enormous”
- “The material is too complex”
- “It would take years”
- “AI can’t be trusted”

These claims do not survive contact with reality.

---

### 2. What Industry Actually Does  

As a matter of routine, large organisations:
- ingest millions of pages of documents
- OCR legacy archives
- build searchable indices
- extract named entities
- flag reputational risk
- sell or circulate structured outputs

This is done:
- continuously
- quietly
- at scale
- for profit

No one treats this as exceptional.

---

### 3. Who Already Does This  

The following sectors treat reindexing as normal:

- **Large insurers**  
- **Litigation support firms**  
- **Reputation management companies**  
- **Private intelligence & due diligence firms**  
- **Large consultancies**  

In many cases, the **same corpus is processed multiple times**, separately, for different clients.

## 💸 Costing Reality (Indicative Estimate)

The following is a **conservative, real-world estimate** for reindexing the full publicly released Epstein document corpus, with human validation.

This is not a “best case”. It reflects standard UK / EU NGO or consultancy rates.

### 1. Technical Costs (One-off)

**Storage & compute**
- PDFs, OCR text, indices: < 1 TB  
- Cloud or local infrastructure

→ **£500 – £1,500**

**OCR processing**
- Open-source OCR (Tesseract) or  
- Commercial OCR (ABBYY / Adobe)

→ **£1,000 – £3,000**

**Indexing & NLP setup**
- Full-text index (Elastic / OpenSearch / equivalent)
- Named entity recognition
- Deduplication & confidence scoring

→ **£1,000 – £3,000**

**Subtotal (technical):**  
**£3,500 – £7,500**

---

### 2. Human Labour (Primary Cost)

Automated extraction is insufficient on its own.  
Human review is required to:
- validate names
- disambiguate entities
- avoid false positives
- preserve evidentiary context

**Minimal credible staffing model**
- 2 full-time equivalents  
- 6–9 months  
- Research / analyst grade (not senior counsel)

**Indicative cost**
- £35k–£45k annual equivalent per person

→ **£50,000 – £70,000**

---

### 3. Admin & Governance Overhead

If structured as a CIC or charity:
- accounting
- compliance
- basic legal advice
- data handling policies

→ **£5,000 – £10,000**

---

### 4. Total Estimated Cost

**Lean, competent implementation**
- **£60,000 (approx.)**

**Comfortable, well-buffered implementation**
- **£85,000–£90,000**

This is **not a large project** by institutional standards.

---

## 🧠 What This Cost Comparison Shows

- This is cheaper than:
  - a single mid-range consultancy engagement
  - one medium litigation disclosure exercise
  - a modest reputation-management retainer

- Multiple private actors will already have:
  - processed this material
  - indexed it
  - extracted names
  - sold insights derived from it

Often repeatedly.

---

## 🧿 Why the Public Is Told It “Can’t Be Done”  

The barrier is not feasibility. It is:

- reputational exposure
- political risk
- loss of narrative control
- downstream accountability

Reindexing collapses ambiguity.  
Ambiguity is often the point.
