# 🧬 Data Bonding Taxonomy  
**First created:** 2025-12-16 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-16  
*How different kinds of data coupling form, stabilise, and propagate power and harm.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Not all data links are equal.

Some associations are weak and contextual.  
Others are strong, persistent, and identity-defining.  
Most governance failures occur because systems **treat weak bonds as strong ones**, or create strong bonds without acknowledging their consequences.

This node sets out a **bond-level taxonomy** for data systems, adapted from molecular biology.  
It allows us to describe *what kind of attachment* is operating — not just that “data is linked”.

The comparison is structural, not metaphorical: both domains rely on **bond strength, reversibility, range, and energy cost**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Distinguishes bond *types*, not just links  
- Explains why some errors propagate and others don’t  
- Clarifies reversibility and correction cost  
- Makes invisible couplings legible  
- Provides a diagnostic language for governance harm

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Why bond types matter  

In proteins, structure emerges from the interaction of multiple bond types, each with different properties.

Data systems behave the same way:
- Some bindings define identity
- Others merely influence interpretation
- Some operate locally
- Others lock distant systems together

Without naming bond types, all linkage appears equal — and accountability disappears.

---

### 2. Covalent bonds — identity-level binding  

**Biological properties**
- Strong
- Directional
- Difficult to break
- Define the backbone

**Data equivalents**
- Primary keys  
- National or state identifiers  
- Persistent UUIDs tied to personhood  
- Biometric hashes  
- “Authoritative” cross-system joins  

**System behaviour**
- Changes propagate everywhere  
- Errors are catastrophic  
- Corrections are treated as suspicious  
- Individuals cannot escape the bond  

Covalent data bonds should be rare.  
In practice, they are overused.

### 3. Hydrogen bonds — contextual inference  

**Biological properties**
- Weak individually  
- Powerful in aggregate  
- Easily formed and broken  
- Highly context-dependent  

**Data equivalents**
- Risk scores  
- Flags and tags  
- Labels such as “at risk”, “concerning”, or “vulnerable”  
- ML feature correlations  
- Similarity-based recommendations  

**System behaviour**
- No single bond “decides”  
- Clusters stabilise outcomes  
- Bonds are easy to add and hard to trace  
- Removal rarely propagates  

The most common governance error is **treating hydrogen bonds as covalent**.

---

### 4. Disulfide bonds — long-range institutional lock-in  

**Biological properties**
- Stronger than hydrogen bonds  
- Connect distant parts of the chain  
- Stabilise tertiary structure  
- Often form after folding begins  

**Data equivalents**
- Inter-agency data-sharing agreements  
- Safeguarding escalation pathways  
- Legal or statutory reporting obligations  
- “Once flagged here, visible there” rules  

**System behaviour**
- Invisible at the point of origin  
- Enforced elsewhere  
- Extremely hard to undo  
- Justified through safety or compliance language  

Disulfide data bonds explain why local corrections fail to have global effect.

---

### 5. Ionic interactions — incentive fields  

**Biological properties**
- Medium strength  
- Sensitive to environment  
- Shape folding pathways  
- Create attraction and repulsion fields  

**Data equivalents**
- KPIs and performance metrics  
- Audit pressure  
- Liability exposure  
- Funding conditions  
- Political or reputational risk  

**System behaviour**
- Do not bind records directly  
- Strongly shape institutional behaviour  
- Bias interpretation toward “safe” outcomes  

Ionic bonds bind **decisions**, not data — but their effect is structural.

---

### 6. Van der Waals forces — ambient bias  

**Biological properties**
- Weak  
- Non-specific  
- Ubiquitous  
- Cumulative effect  

**Data equivalents**
- Default settings  
- Interface design  
- Form layouts  
- Dropdown ordering  
- Pre-filled categories  

**System behaviour**
- Individually negligible  
- Collectively powerful  
- Rarely audited  
- Shape outcomes through friction  

These forces explain why systems drift without explicit policy change.

---

### 7. Aggregation and prion-like propagation  

When misfolded proteins aggregate, they can induce misfolding elsewhere.

Data shows the same pattern:
- Template reuse  
- Pattern-based decision-making  
- “Known cases” logic  
- Training data contamination  

Once a misclassification pattern stabilises, it replicates without intent.

---

### 8. Bond confusion as a governance failure  

Most harm arises not from malice, but from **bond confusion**:

- Weak bonds treated as permanent  
- Strong bonds created without consent  
- Long-range bonds hidden from scrutiny  
- Correction rights applied at the wrong layer  

Bond literacy is therefore a governance requirement, not a technical nicety.

*🧬 Data Bonding Taxonomy* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It provides a bond-level diagnostic framework for understanding how data attachments form, persist, and cause harm across complex systems.
