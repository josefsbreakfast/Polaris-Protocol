# 📚 Library as Algorithmic Interface  
**First created:** 2025-10-16 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*From card catalogues to content classifiers — how bureaucracy taught algorithms to blush.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Before there were algorithms, there were librarians.  
Long before “trust & safety” teams existed, human cataloguers built moral geometry into the shelves: what could be seen, how, and by whom.  
This node tracks how those classification habits became the skeleton of digital moderation — the *etiquette of exclusion* baked into metadata itself.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- **Moral metadata:** subject headings carry judgments (“abnormal psychology,” “sexual deviance,” “obscene literature”).  
- **Hierarchical bias:** Dewey and LoC systems place whiteness, Christianity, and patriarchy at their numeric centre.  
- **Legacy inheritance:** modern content-taxonomies (YouTube’s, OpenAI’s, Meta’s) are direct descendants of library ontologies.  
- **Politeness as control:** the language of propriety becomes the syntax of filtering.

## 🧿 Analysis  

Every library is an operating system.  
Dewey’s decimals, Cutter’s rules, LoC subject trees — all are early attempts to force infinite human variation into finite bureaucratic order.  
When digital moderation arrived, it inherited the same schema: a neat, hierarchical world with a panic button for anything *out of category.*

> The librarian’s “restricted shelf” becomes the platform’s “limited visibility”;  
> the card catalogue’s cross-reference becomes the algorithmic “related content” model.

Both systems promise neutrality while performing selection.  
Both produce safety by silence.

### 🧠 From Shelfmark to Signal  

| Library Practice | Algorithmic Equivalent | Function |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Controlled vocabularies | Training-data labels | Normalise discourse |
| Restricted stacks | Shadowban queues | Limit circulation |
| Reader cards / permissions | User verification / age gates | Gate access |
| Subject reclassification | Content relabelling | Sanitise visibility |

The moral project of classification outlived the shelf.  
It lives in code: “harmful,” “sensitive,” “graphic,” “restricted.”  
The syntax changes; the instinct remains.

### 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Voice Lens  

For those whose realities fall outside normative taxonomies — survivors, dissidents, queer bodies, the undocumented — each filter is a potential disappearance.  
The machine inherits the librarian’s discretion but none of their conscience.  
Appeal systems function like reference desks that never answer.

## 🏮 Footer  

*📚 Library as Algorithmic Interface* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the inheritance between cataloguing bureaucracy and machine moderation — showing how every database is still a library with a moral code.
