# 🩸 Sexual Capital Extraction Model  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*A structural model for how women’s sexuality is converted into extractable value*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node formalises a model observed across modern misogynistic economies:  
the systematic conversion of women’s sexuality, attention, and emotional labour into **male-controlled economic output**.

The term *sexual capital* is not used here to endorse the framing, but to document how it is operationalised within exploitative systems.

This is a **descriptive model of extraction**, not a metaphor.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Translation:** Sexuality reframed as capital rather than agency  
- **Enclosure:** Autonomy restricted to enable capture  
- **Mediation:** Male actors positioned as “managers” or “owners”  
- **Extraction:** Attention and desire converted into revenue  
- **Obfuscation:** Harm reframed as opportunity or consent  
- **Persistence:** System survives regardless of individual actors

## 🧿 Analysis

### Phase 1: Identification of a Yield-Bearing Resource

The model begins by identifying women’s sexuality and desirability as:
- inherently valuable,
- consistently in demand,
- and capable of generating attention at scale.

This value is framed as *latent* — something women allegedly possess but cannot “properly” monetise without male intervention.

This framing is crucial.  
It establishes the pretext for enclosure.

---

### Phase 2: Translation into Capital Language

Sexuality is then redefined using economic abstractions:
- desire → demand  
- attention → traffic  
- intimacy → conversion  
- presence → engagement  
- autonomy → inefficiency  

Once translated, the human subject disappears behind metrics.

At this stage, ethical objections become harder to articulate, because harm has been converted into neutral business language.

---

### Phase 3: Enclosure and Control

Extraction requires control.

Common enclosure tactics include:
- isolating the woman from alternative support systems  
- controlling access to platforms or accounts  
- framing independence as risk or betrayal  
- redefining coercion as “leadership” or “guidance”  

Autonomy is not attacked directly.
It is reframed as *mismanagement*.

---

### Phase 4: Mediation and Capture

A male intermediary positions himself as:
- manager,
- strategist,
- protector,
- or “value optimiser.”

Revenue flows through him.
Decision-making authority resides with him.
Risk is externalised onto the woman.

At this point, the system mirrors classic extractive industries:
those closest to the resource bear the cost; those controlling the pipeline capture the profit.

---

### Phase 5: Justification and Moral Laundering

To stabilise the system, extraction is justified through:
- appeals to realism (“this is how the world works”),  
- narratives of empowerment (“she’s choosing this”),  
- claims of mutual benefit (“everyone wins”),  
- or attacks on critics (“they’re jealous / naïve / ideological”).

This is the moral laundering stage.
It allows participants to remain inside the system without confronting harm.

---

### Phase 6: Replication and Scaling

Once formalised, the model:
- becomes teachable,  
- detaches from individual relationships,  
- and scales across platforms and borders.

Women become interchangeable inputs.
Men become operators.
The system persists even when specific actors exit.

This is the point at which extraction becomes **structural**.

---

## 🧩 Why This Is an Extraction Model (Not a Relationship Model)

Relationships are characterised by:
- mutuality,
- reversibility,
- consent,
- and shared benefit.

Extraction systems are characterised by:
- asymmetry,
- dependency,
- opacity,
- and enforced continuation.

The sexual capital extraction model exhibits the latter.
Calling it a “relationship strategy” is a category error.

*Sexual Capital Extraction Model* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents a repeatable pattern through which women’s sexuality is enclosed, mediated, and monetised within misogynistic economic systems.
