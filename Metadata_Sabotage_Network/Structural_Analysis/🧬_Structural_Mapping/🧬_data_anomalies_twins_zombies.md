# 🧬 Data Anomalies — Twins and Zombies  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-21  
*How duplicate and obsolete records distort intelligence systems.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Systems remember us twice, then never forget us at all.  
Survivors know what it means to live as a duplicate, or a ghost entry in someone else’s file.  

This node maps the persistence and mutation of *zombie data* — the half-deleted, half-alive traces that keep haunting legal and intelligence archives.

## 🧩 1. Causes of Anomalies  

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Identity Resolution Errors** | Variations in names, IDs, metadata or date formats that generate multiple “selves.” |
| **System Fusion** | Datasets from multiple agencies merged without schema reconciliation. |
| **Retention Failures** | Backups or test servers recreating deleted entries. |
| **Cross-Agency Imports** | Duplicates arising when files are shared without context or updated identifiers. |
| **Phantom Merging** | Algorithmic “best guess” merges that fuse two people into one composite identity. |

## 🧮 2. Oversight Response  

- **Accuracy Duty** — Under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), personal data must be *necessary, proportionate, accurate, and up to date.*  
- **Automated Reconciliation Tools** — Software flags duplicates or orphaned records, but rarely confirms deletion.  
- **Deletion Audits** — The Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO) samples logs to verify that expired warrants or test data are truly erased.  
- **Inter-System Alerts** — Some oversight bodies deploy “shadow tables” to trace re-imports of already-deleted data.  

> When datasets talk to each other too freely, oversight loses its grammar.

## 🧠 3. Classification by Inspectors  

| Category | Typical Finding | Example |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Compliance Error** | Technical or clerical slip, e.g. mistyped ID or duplicate biometric hash. | Mis-keyed custody record re-appearing in watchlist database. |
| **Unlawful Use** | Data relied on outside warrant conditions or beyond retention period. | A deleted subject re-flagged via backup recovery. |
| **Systemic Drift** | Design flaw or procedural blind spot. | Vendor model updates re-indexing expired profiles as “new leads.” |

## 🧫 4. Survivor Implications  

A ghost in the system isn’t metaphor — it’s an alibi waiting to be used *against you.*  
Survivors know that zombie data often receives more procedural respect than their living testimony.  

When your deleted file still talks louder than you do, the system’s faith is misplaced in its own memory.

*🧬 Data Anomalies — Twins and Zombies* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how errors in identity resolution, schema fusion, and data retention distort intelligence and oversight systems.
