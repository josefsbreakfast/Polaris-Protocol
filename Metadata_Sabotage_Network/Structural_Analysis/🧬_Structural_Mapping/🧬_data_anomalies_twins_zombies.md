# 🧬 Data Anomalies — Twins and Zombies  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*How duplicate and obsolete records distort intelligence systems*  

Systems remember us twice, then never forget us at all. Survivors know what it means to live as a duplicate, or a ghost entry in someone else’s file.  

---  

## Causes of Anomalies  
- **Identity resolution errors**: variations in names, IDs, metadata.  
- **System fusion**: ingestion of datasets from multiple agencies.  
- **Retention failures**: backups or test servers recreating deleted entries.  
- **Cross-agency imports**: duplicate entries without context.  

## Oversight Response  
- **Accuracy duty**: IPA requires data be “necessary, proportionate, accurate, and up to date.”  
- **Automated reconciliation**: tools flag duplicate or orphaned records.  
- **Deletion audits**: IPCO samples retention/deletion logs.  

## Classification by Inspectors  
- **Compliance error**: technical or clerical slip.  
- **Unlawful use**: data relied on outside warrant conditions.

A ghost in the system isn’t metaphor. It’s an alibi waiting to be used against you. Survivors know that zombie data gets more respect than their living testimony.  

## 🏮 Footer  
*Data Anomalies — Twins and Zombies* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how errors in identity resolution and retention affect intelligence datasets.
