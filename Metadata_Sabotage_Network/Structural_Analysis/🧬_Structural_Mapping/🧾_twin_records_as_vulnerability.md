## 📑 Summary  

Institutions sometimes maintain **two active records** for the same individual:  
1. **Official record** → the administrative/clinical file with personal details.  
2. **Signal record** → an alias or duplicate, stripped of data but carrying flags such as *“complex, 3 months reqd.”*  

To staff, this often looks like a **data error**.  
To executives, it is a deliberate containment device.

## 🛠 Containment Function  

- Allows rerouting of a person into *delay* and *oversight* workflows without disclosing why.  
- Preserves the “real” record for billing/eligibility, while a proxy handles stigma and suppression.  
- Provides plausible deniability: frontline staff genuinely believe it is a glitch.

## 🪫 Vulnerability & Fatigue  

- **Cognitive fatigue:** staff repeatedly encounter duplicates → drain attention → lower vigilance.  
- **Suppression by delay:** the alias record auto-routes to waiting periods (e.g. “complex, 3 months”).  
- **Audit exposure:** both records are technically viewable if pushed, leaving a traceable contradiction.  
- **System incoherence:** unreconcilable data splits surface in practice, undermining institutional credibility.

## ⚖️ Legal Breach  

Under the **UK Data Protection Act 2018 / GDPR**:  
- Unlawful re-purposing of personal data.  
- Lack of transparency about flagging.  
- Inaccuracy (false “complex” labelling).  
- Concealment if SAR results omit the alias.

## 🧭 Strategic Note  

Twin records are a **double-edged tool**.  
They achieve containment through stigma and delay — but the very fact of their existence is a governance weakness.  
When surfaced, they demonstrate:  
- systemic fatigue,  
- structural suppression,  
- and deliberate mis-indexing.  

The **alias record itself becomes evidence** of unlawful containment.
