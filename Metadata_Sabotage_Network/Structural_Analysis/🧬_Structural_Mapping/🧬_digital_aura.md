*The subtle behavioural halo each person emits through everyday digital interactions.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
A “digital aura” is the **felt presence** a person generates in digital space —  
not through identity, and not through surveillance,  
but through the **pattern** of how they move across devices, platforms, and information.

It is the atmospheric trace of:

- emotional pacing  
- interaction style  
- pauses and accelerations  
- the way attention touches an interface  
- the micro-rhythms of being human online  

It is *not* a privacy threat.  
It is the **poetry** of behavioural metadata.

## 🌐 What Makes a Digital Aura  
A digital aura forms from:

- scroll patterns  
- tap rhythm  
- return frequency  
- micro-hesitations  
- error-correction  
- posture shifts (if tracked),  
- notification responses  
- the “shape” of how a person interacts with information  

Each device only sees a **slice**,  
but taken together, the slices produce a faint, consistent glow —  
a behavioural fingerprint, not an identity one.

## 🫧 What It Feels Like  
A digital aura is the modern equivalent of:

- the sound of someone’s footsteps  
- the rhythm of their breathing  
- the cadence of their handwriting  
- the way they leaf through a book  

It is the **texture** of a person’s presence.

## 🧠 Why Polaris Cares  
Polaris analyses governance systems, power, and data.  
Understanding digital aura helps explain:

- how humans reveal themselves unintentionally  
- how emotional states ripple through interfaces  
- why devices register friction without needing “surveillance”  
- how systems misinterpret or strip nuance  
- why some people consistently generate “administrative noise”

The digital aura is the humanitarian counterpoint to data paranoia:  
**you can have behavioural residue without threat.**

*🧬 Digital Aura* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It conceptualises the soft glow of human behaviour in digital environments without implying surveillance, targeting, or risk.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
