*How outdated embeddings and legacy geometry persist, distort interpretation, and resist correction*

## What this node is about

Embedding inertia describes the tendency of machine-learning systems to **retain and reuse outdated behavioural representations**, even after the conditions that produced them have changed.

Ghost geometry refers to the **residual shape of old embedding spaces** — clusters, centroids, distances, and boundaries that continue to influence system behaviour despite no longer reflecting current reality.

Together, these phenomena explain why systems can appear to:
- remember things that are no longer true  
- treat past misclassifications as ongoing facts  
- behave as if errors have not been corrected  

This is not intentional memory.
It is architectural persistence.

## What embeddings actually are (and are not)

An embedding is a mathematical compression of behaviour.

It is:
- a summary  
- a projection  
- a convenience  

It is **not**:
- a live record  
- an identity  
- a ground truth representation  

Embeddings trade accuracy for tractability.
Once created, they are reused because recalculating them constantly is expensive.

This reuse is where inertia enters.

## How embedding inertia forms

Embedding inertia typically arises when:

- embeddings are generated in batches  
- retraining cycles are infrequent  
- downstream systems cache representations  
- legacy models feed newer pipelines  
- embeddings are shared across features or services  
- decay mechanisms are weak or absent  

In these conditions, an embedding can outlive:
- the behaviour that produced it  
- the model version that created it  
- the assumptions baked into its geometry  

The system continues to act on a **fossilised abstraction**.

## Ghost geometry: when the map outlives the territory

Ghost geometry emerges when:

- old clusters remain structurally intact  
- centroids persist after populations drift  
- distances retain meaning long after relevance  
- sparse regions remain “occupied” by very few points  

Even if new data arrives, it is often **mapped onto the old space**, rather than generating a new one.

This means:
- old errors shape new interpretation  
- similarity is judged relative to obsolete neighbours  
- misclassifications propagate forward in time  

The geometry becomes haunted — not by people, but by history.

---

## Interaction with sparse clusters

Embedding inertia amplifies sparse cluster pathology.

When a cluster shrinks:
- from many → few  
- or few → two  

…the embedding geometry does not automatically adjust.

The cluster’s *shape* remains, even as its *population* collapses.

This produces situations where:
- two users occupy a large conceptual region  
- similarity appears exaggerated  
- proximity is misread as significance  

The system does not “notice” the sparsity.
It only sees geometry.

---

## Why embedding inertia feels personal

From a human perspective, embedding inertia can feel like:

- being repeatedly misread  
- being unable to escape an old narrative  
- having past behaviour follow you indefinitely  
- corrections not being believed  
- explanations not landing  

This is because:
- humans expect memory to update  
- systems expect patterns to persist  

The mismatch creates a sense of being stuck inside an old version of oneself.

---

## Why correction does not propagate cleanly

Even when an error is recognised upstream:

- downstream systems may still rely on old embeddings  
- retraining may update weights but not geometry  
- decay windows may be too long  
- cached vectors may never be invalidated  
- human reviewers may trust historical scores  

As a result, a correction can exist **locally** while the misinterpretation persists **globally**.

This is how “ghosts” survive remediation.

---

## Interaction with behavioural proxies

Embedding inertia is especially dangerous when combined with proxy misinterpretation.

When a proxy-based inference is embedded:
- it becomes part of the vector  
- it influences distance and similarity  
- it affects clustering and scoring  
- it travels across systems  

Even if the proxy is later understood to be unreliable, its **encoded influence** remains unless explicitly removed.

This turns a weak guess into a durable structural feature.

---

## Why this is not a bug (but still a problem)

From an engineering perspective, embedding inertia is often treated as acceptable because:

- frequent retraining is costly  
- stability is valued over churn  
- legacy compatibility matters  
- performance metrics may not show obvious degradation  

But from a governance and harm perspective, this means:

- outdated interpretations persist  
- people are assessed against past abstractions  
- misclassification becomes temporally extended  
- error correction is partial at best  

The system behaves “as designed” — and still causes harm.

---

## When embedding inertia becomes harmful

Embedding inertia becomes harmful when it is allowed to:

- sustain incorrect inferences  
- reinforce sparse cluster effects  
- anchor reputational narratives  
- support behavioural steering or risk classification  
- resist contestation or explanation  

At this point, the system is no longer merely slow to update.
It is **actively misrepresenting the present**.

---

## Key takeaway

> **An embedding that does not decay  
becomes a story the system refuses to forget.**

When geometry outlives context, yesterday’s guess becomes today’s truth — and users carry the weight of that lag.

*Embedding Inertia and Ghost Geometry* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, documenting how outdated embeddings and legacy modelling spaces persist inside active systems, shaping interpretation long after their assumptions have expired.

This node frames persistence itself as a risk factor — especially when combined with sparse clustering and proxy-based inference.
