**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*The moment actors disentangle their own actions from those of others.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node defines a **responsibility differentiation event**:  
the point at which an actor in a multi-party system explicitly reassesses **where their responsibility ends and others’ begins**.

This moment often follows sustained scrutiny and marks the end of collective identity.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Boundary clarification  
- De-coupling of responsibility  
- Internal risk reassessment  
- Collapse of shared narrative  
- Transition to individual accountability  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. The triggering question  

Responsibility differentiation begins with a simple realisation:

> **“We do not actually know what the others did.”**

This recognition forces actors to reassess their own exposure.

---

### 2. From collective to individual logic  

Before the event:
- responsibility is blurred  
- narratives are shared  
- silence is coordinated  

After the event:
- timelines are separated  
- decisions are individuated  
- accountability is localised  

---

### 3. Why this moment matters  

Once responsibility is differentiated:
- collective defence collapses  
- shared risk dissolves  
- each actor must justify their own actions  

This marks a permanent structural shift.

---

### 4. Observable effects  

Externally, responsibility differentiation appears as:
- selective disclosures  
- clarified scopes  
- narrowed statements  
- internal distancing language  

Internally, it is the point of no return.
