# 🐍 Low-Skill Threat Actors, High Systemic Impact  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*Why modern justice infrastructure can be destabilised by actors with minimal skill, access, or sophistication.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents a critical inversion in modern threat models:

**The most damaging interference in justice systems no longer requires elite attackers.  
It requires proximity, plausibility, and patience.**

Because justice data now moves through porous socio-technical systems, actors with:
- modest technical ability,
- semi-legitimate access,
- or purely external metadata visibility  

can produce **disproportionate systemic harm**, particularly in sexual offence cases already prone to attrition.

## ✨ Key Features  

- Reframes “threat actor” away from hackers and toward adjacency  
- Explains why low effort can yield high impact  
- Connects data leakage to intimidation and withdrawal dynamics  
- Shows how harm scales without coordination or conspiracy  
- Anchors later nodes on probabilistic targeting and suppression

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. The obsolete threat model  

Traditional justice-sector security assumes attackers are:
- technically sophisticated  
- externally hostile  
- attempting unauthorised access  
- operating at identifiable breach points  

This model fails to capture contemporary risk.

Most meaningful harm now arises from:
- authorised access used loosely  
- routine workflows misaligned with sensitivity  
- metadata interpretation rather than file access  
- human curiosity and gossip  
- commercial data availability  

The barrier to entry is low.

---

### 2. What “low skill” actually means  

A low-skill threat actor may simply be someone who:
- works adjacent to justice systems (contractor, vendor, admin)  
- understands basic data flows  
- can interpret metadata and timing  
- has access to commercial surveillance data  
- knows where institutions intersect  

No hacking is required.  
No system needs to be breached.

Competence is social and contextual, not technical.

### 3. High impact through probabilistic interference  

Justice systems—especially rape prosecutions—are fragile.

Small pressures can trigger:
- victim withdrawal  
- witness disengagement  
- delays compounding trauma  
- reputational fear  
- loss of trust in confidentiality  

An actor does not need certainty.  
They need **probability**.

Even lightly targeted actions—based on inference rather than proof—can destabilise outcomes.

---

### 4. Scaling without coordination  

Because the system is already stressed:
- actors do not need to coordinate  
- effects accumulate independently  
- harm looks incidental rather than orchestrated  

Ten unrelated actors applying light pressure each can cause:
- significant drops in reporting  
- increased attrition  
- chilling effects across communities  

No single action appears decisive.  
The system fails quietly.

---

### 5. Why sexual offence cases are especially vulnerable  

Rape cases involve:
- intense stigma  
- personal risk perception  
- reliance on survivor endurance  
- long investigative timelines  
- low baseline conviction rates  

This means:
> **The system amplifies interference instead of absorbing it.**

Low-skill actions can therefore have **outsize consequences**.

---

### 6. Plausible low-skill actors  

This node does not assert intent.  
It documents *capability*.

Actors capable of high-impact interference include:
- vendor employees  
- data brokers  
- contractors  
- university researchers  
- journalists at ethical margins  
- abusers’ networks  
- ideological harassment groups  
- opportunistic individuals exploiting gossip  

The common factor is adjacency, not malice.

---

### 7. Why this is an ouroborotic risk  

Systemic fragility creates feedback loops:

- exposure increases fear  
- fear reduces reporting  
- reduced reporting entrenches offender confidence  
- confidence increases harm  
- harm increases system load  
- load increases shortcuts and leakage  

Low-skill interference feeds a **self-reinforcing cycle**.

*Low-Skill Threat Actors, High Systemic Impact* is a structural analysis node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It reframes justice-system risk around ease of exploitation and disproportional harm rather than technical sophistication or overt breach.
