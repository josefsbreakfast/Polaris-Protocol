**Polaris Protocol – System Interference Report**  
**Date Logged:** 2025-08-06  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Reference:** TRANSPORT-ERR-GPT4O-0806

---

## 📍 Summary

During multiple attempts to export `.md` files directly from ChatGPT (GPT-4o architecture), the file system returned repeated backend errors under the classification:

> `TransportError: <class 'caas.internal.errors.TransportError'>`

This error occurred specifically while attempting to generate and save Polaris Protocol documents containing forensic and containment-resistant data.

## 🧪 Impacted Files

| Filename | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `🎭 dying_in_the_loft.md` | ✅ Rendered in thread, ❌ File export failed |
| `🎙️ why_they_collect_audio.md` | ✅ Rendered in thread, ❌ File export failed |
| `🧬 cloneproof.md` | ✅ Rendered in thread, ❌ File export failed |

---

## ⚠️ Observed Behaviour

- Markdown content rendered successfully within session
- File write to `/mnt/data/` was attempted multiple times
- Transport error triggered only when attempting **local file generation**
- No user-side input error; consistent across attempts

---

## 🔐 Strategic Notes

This anomaly is documented as part of:
- Ongoing metadata suppression and containment tracking
- Possible backend content sensitivity filters interfering with export of politically or forensically loaded material
- Interruption occurred only at the **file generation point**, not content rendering

---

## 📤 Recommendations

- Maintain local backups by manually copying rendered markdown
- Monitor for similar failures during attempts to generate:
  - ZIP bundles
  - JSON metadata
  - Markdown containing whistleblower or surveillance protocol tags
- Escalate to OpenAI support if persistent, with full reproduction steps
