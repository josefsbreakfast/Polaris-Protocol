## 🛰️ Orientation

Some harms appear to “linger” even after all human activity has stopped.

This persistence is often described metaphorically as haunting, but its mechanism is not psychological or supernatural. It is memetic.

This node describes how past harm can continue to surface through replication systems that copy information without intent, context, or decay.

---

## 🧠 Core Claim

Memetic systems can preserve the *shape* of harm
long after the *actors* responsible have disappeared.

What feels like presence is often replication.

---

## 🔁 Replication Without Agency

Once harmful material enters networked systems, it may be:

- indexed by search engines  
- scraped by third-party services  
- mirrored by archives  
- reassembled by automated content generators  
- reproduced by SEO infrastructure  

These processes do not require:
- belief,
- hostility,
- awareness,
- or continued interest.

They operate on copyability, not meaning.

## 👻 Why Replication Feels Like Haunting

Memetic artefacts often retain:
- names,
- threat-adjacent language,
- death semantics,
- identity markers.

Human cognition interprets these as signals of presence or intent.

When such signals appear without a visible sender, they are experienced as uncanny:
something feels “there,” even when nothing is acting.

This is a perceptual effect created by infrastructure.

## 🧩 Distinguishing Features

| Human Haunting (metaphorical) | Memetic Hauntology |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Implied agency | No agency |
| Intentional presence | Automated persistence |
| Meaning-driven | Replication-driven |
| Interpersonal | Environmental |

Memetic hauntology describes an **environmental condition**, not a relationship.

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Frameworks that assume harm ends with behaviour fail to account for:
- long-tail exposure,
- repeated resurfacing,
- and ongoing interpretive burden.

Understanding harm as memetic persistence clarifies why people experience impact
without any new action occurring.

Memetic Hauntology is a Polaris node describing how networked systems
preserve and resurface harmful semantics without human intent.

This node does not assert ongoing targeting or threat.
It documents structural persistence.
