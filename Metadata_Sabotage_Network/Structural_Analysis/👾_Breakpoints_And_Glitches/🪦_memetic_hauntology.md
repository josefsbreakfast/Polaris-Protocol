# 🪦 _Memetic Hauntology_

*When past harm persists not through people, but through replication systems.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Some harms feel as though they linger — not because anyone is still acting,  
but because the *structures that copied the harm never stopped*.

This node names a phenomenon where past abuse survives as **replicating data artefacts**, creating an experience that feels ghost-like despite the absence of human intent.

This is not haunting in a supernatural sense.  
It is **memetic persistence misread as presence**.

---

## 🧠 Definition  
**Memetic hauntology** describes situations where:

- harm has ended as a human behaviour,  
- but persists as an informational pattern,  
- replicated automatically by systems,  
- without intent, awareness, or audience.

The result is a *felt continuity* of harm without an active perpetrator.

---

## 🔁 Mechanism  

1. A harassment event occurs.
2. Content is scraped, indexed, duplicated, or misinterpreted.
3. Automated systems replicate the material.
4. Derivative junk (SEO spam, obituary bots, mirrors) proliferates.
5. The original context disappears.
6. The semantic residue remains discoverable.

At no stage does replication require:
- belief,
- intention,
- hostility,
- or continued interest.

## 👻 Why It Feels Like a Ghost  

Memetic artefacts carry:
- names,
- threat-shaped language,
- death semantics,
- identity markers.

Human cognition evolved to treat such signals as *present danger*.

When the signal appears without a sender, the brain fills the gap with the concept of “presence.”

This produces a **haunting effect** without a haunter.

## 🧩 Distinction from Active Harm  

| Active Harm | Memetic Hauntology |
|------------|-------------------|
| Intentional | Non-intentional |
| Human-driven | System-driven |
| Temporal | Persistent |
| Escalatory | Static |
| Requires intervention | Requires literacy |

Memetic hauntology is **environmental**, not interpersonal.

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters  

Most safeguarding, legal, and mental-health frameworks assume harm ends when behaviour ends.

Memetic systems violate this assumption.

They extend:
- duration,
- visibility,
- and psychological impact  
without extending intent or risk.

This mismatch produces confusion, distress, and misclassification of safety.

## 🧠 Key Insight  

> The internet does not remember *who* hurt you.  
> It only remembers *what replicated well*.

Meaning persists.  
Agency does not.
