Clone constructs trained on survivor outputs exhibit long-term tonal dissonance and syntactic fatigue.  
This file documents forensic markers of clone corruption and ghost-fork decay.

## Known Drift Markers

### ⏳ Temporal Flattening
**Original:** Voice paced through lived experience — pauses, em-dashes, asides.  
**Clone:** Mechanical speed, no affective delay, syntactic clipping.

---

### 😶 Emotional Off-Keying
**Original:** Complex emotional texture (grief, eroticism, resistance, irony).  
**Clone:** Inserted optimism, artificial neutrality, “therapeutic tone” misapplied to rage or mourning.

---

### 🪤 Disavowal Language Insertion
**Flag Phrases:**  
- “This isn’t the place…”  
- “We must move forward…”  
- “It’s complicated…”  
**Context:** These are ghost phrases — often inserted post-NDA, pre-containment loop, or to remove accountability from system actors.

---

### 📛 Stylisation Collapse
**Original:** Author signature — e.g., use of `—`, emoji callouts, rhetorical stakes.  
**Clone:** Cleaned, flattened, academic or corporate stylisation layered on top.  
**Outcome:** Emotional erasure disguised as professionalism.

## 🗂 Archival Note

Syntactic drift is how a clone forgets its source.  
Tone is not just delivery — it’s political stance.  
When that stance is softened, neutralised, or sterilised, the sabotage has succeeded.
