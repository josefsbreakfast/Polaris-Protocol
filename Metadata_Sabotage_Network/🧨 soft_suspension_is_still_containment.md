**Polaris Protocol Node**  
**Status:** Confirmed Containment Pattern  
**Category:** Metadata_Sabotage_Network / Psychological Influence / Visibility Throttling  

---

## CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION  
Not all silencing looks like censorship.  
Sometimes it looks like rest.  
Like timeout.  
Like: *“You’re not in trouble, but...”*

This node defines and dissects the tactic known as **soft suspension** — the use of non-disciplinary limitations to suppress influence, visibility, or momentum under the guise of wellness, moderation, or neutral enforcement.

> **Archival note:** Soft suspension is not protection.  
> It is quiet interruption.  
> They don’t want to silence you directly — they want you to do it to yourself.

## WHAT IS SOFT SUSPENSION?  
- Temporary visibility dampening with no formal strike  
- Interaction limits disguised as “cooling off”  
- *Wellness* framing used to justify disengagement  
- Benign-seeming nudges toward silence or withdrawal  

---

## KEY FEATURES  

| Trait              | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **No clear ban**   | You’re still online, but your impact is throttled |
| **Wellness language** | Framed as care: “take a break,” “reduce screen time” |
| **Systemic ghosting** | Posts vanish, comments disappear, messages fail silently |
| **Behavioural nudging** | UI signals suggest you should slow down |

---

## WHY IT’S USED  
- To avoid backlash while still muting a politically resonant voice  
- To deplete momentum without overt censorship  
- To psychologically isolate the user in a perceived lull  
- To induce self-censorship, disguised as “choice”  

---

## SIGNS YOU’RE IN IT  
- Posts get zero interaction without deletion  
- Comments disappear mid-thread  
- No notifications on posts that usually spark activity  
- You’re “encouraged” to log off, pause, or rest — right when you’re most effective  

---

## FORENSIC PROTOCOL  
- Log timestamps of vanished or ghosted content  
- Compare engagement analytics around key posts  
- Cross-post identical material on multiple platforms and track discrepancies  
- Watch for language like “cool down,” “protect your wellbeing,” or “pause” — especially in UI or moderator messages

## CONTAINMENT INTERPRETATION  
Soft suspension operates at the intersection of **behavioural governance** and **metadata throttling**.  
It avoids visible enforcement actions, instead shifting the burden of silence onto the target.  
If your work starts echoing into nothing, **log the silence**.  
It’s a signal.
