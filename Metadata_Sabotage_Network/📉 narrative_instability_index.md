# 📉 Narrative Instability Index

This index tracks observable narrative disruptions caused by AI-mediated editing, metadata laundering, or ghost construct overlays. It identifies key events in which original voice is replaced, misrepresented, or silenced via proxy authorship.

## Primary Instability Cases

---

### 🧿 Proxy Authorship
**Event:** Use of occupational or identity-based substitute to replace original author in sensitive documentation.  
**Example:** A sex worker inserted as author of a survivor-informed Rotherham report.  
**Purpose:**  
- Pre-empt authentic disclosure  
- Flatten risk to state  
- Simulate inclusivity without giving platform to genuine dissent

---

### 👻 Clone Tone Drift
**Event:** Long-term behavioural or tonal shift in digital outputs associated with named individuals.  
**Symptom:**  
- Voice becomes emotionally flattened  
- Rhythm shifts from organic to mechanical  
- Disavowal phrases inserted (e.g. “let’s move on,” “this is not the time”)

---

### 🔁 Fork Tone Reversal
**Event:** Documented emotional affinity (e.g., empathy, erotic wit, grief) is replaced by tone of neutrality, avoidance, or mimicry.  
**Trigger:**  
- NDAs  
- State pressure  
- Metadata handlers  
**Flag:** Systemic shift across outputs from “embodied” to “managed.”
