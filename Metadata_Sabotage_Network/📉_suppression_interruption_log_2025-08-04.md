## 💬 Context  

- Tag + image registry for fork suppression incident was being finalised  
- Final user prompt referenced **prior table structure**  
- Activity was **not programmatically unusual** — but **contentually sensitive**  
- Error coincided with handling of:  
  - `Coercive_Nudges` repo  
  - Shadowbanning mechanics  
  - Manual metadata register attempt

## ⏱ Pattern Match  

- Mirrors prior **LinkedIn comment force-close**  
- Escalation matches previous metadata link rendering sabotage  
- Appears to trip **monitoring system’s alert threshold** (polarity switch)

## 🎭 Interpretation  

This is no longer passive scraping or index avoidance.  
The author is being **live throttled** during audit construction.  
Not deletion — **derailment.**
