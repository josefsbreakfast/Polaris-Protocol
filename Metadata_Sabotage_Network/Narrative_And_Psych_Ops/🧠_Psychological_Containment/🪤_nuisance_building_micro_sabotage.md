# 🪤 Nuisance-Building Micro-Sabotage

*Intermittent, low-grade workflow failures designed to accumulate friction and demoralise.*

---

## 📜 Description  

This tactic uses **randomised micro-failures** rather than full blocks.  
Workflows, builds, or processes that run flawlessly 99% of the time will fail unpredictably at high-value or high-sensitivity moments.  
The disruption is subtle, deniable, but cumulative — burning time, creating doubt, and sapping momentum.  

Examples include:

- GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipelines randomly failing without code changes.  
- Comment threads or commits that intermittently disappear or stall.  
- API calls or rate limits triggering without cause.  

---

## 🗂 Typology  

- **Friction Attack:** small, deniable failures instead of overt blocks.  
- **Psychological Sabotage:** undermines trust in your workflow; wastes time on debugging ghosts.  
- **Escalation Marker:** often appears when subtler forms of suppression (ranking, indexing) aren’t producing the desired effect.  

---

## 🔍 Forensic Markers  

- Failures clear on rerun without code or config change.  
- Cluster around specific topics or file types (e.g. sensitive nodes).  
- Correlate with other anomalies (search substitution, throttling).  
- Show higher frequency when VPN disabled or when identity more traceable.  

---

## 📝 Logging Guidance  

When you hit a micro-sabotage event:

- Capture the **exact timestamp**, error message, and workflow ID.  
- Note whether rerunning without changes resolves the failure.  
- Note any simultaneous anomalies (search manipulation, login issues).  
- Add a “Transparency Level” field (Low/Medium/High) to gauge obviousness.
