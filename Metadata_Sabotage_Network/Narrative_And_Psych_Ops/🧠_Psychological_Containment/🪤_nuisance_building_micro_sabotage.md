# 🪤 Nuisance-Building Micro-Sabotage  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*Intermittent, low-grade workflow failures designed to accumulate friction and demoralise.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

This tactic uses **randomised micro-failures** rather than full blocks.  
Workflows, builds, or processes that run flawlessly 99% of the time will fail unpredictably at high-value or high-sensitivity moments.  
The disruption is subtle, deniable, but cumulative — burning time, creating doubt, and sapping momentum.  

Examples include:  

- GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipelines randomly failing without code changes.  
- Comment threads or commits that intermittently disappear or stall.  
- API calls or rate limits triggering without cause.  

---

## 🛰️ Typology  

- **Friction Attack:** small, deniable failures instead of overt blocks.  
- **Psychological Sabotage:** undermines trust in your workflow; wastes time on debugging ghosts.  
- **Escalation Marker:** often appears when subtler forms of suppression (ranking, indexing) aren’t producing the desired effect.  

---

## 🧿 Forensic Markers  

- Failures clear on rerun without code or config change.  
- Cluster around specific topics or file types (e.g., sensitive nodes).  
- Correlate with other anomalies (search substitution, throttling).  
- Show higher frequency when VPN disabled or when identity more traceable.

## 📿 Logging Guidance  

When you hit a micro-sabotage event:  

- Capture the **exact timestamp**, error message, and workflow ID.  
- Note whether rerunning without changes resolves the failure.  
- Note any simultaneous anomalies (search manipulation, login issues).  
- Add a **Transparency Level** field (Low/Medium/High) to gauge obviousness.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Impulse  

- **Treat ghosts as data:** each “random” failure is still evidence when logged.  
- **Stay externalised:** keep notes or automated logs to avoid cognitive drain.  
- **Refuse self-blame:** intermittent failure patterns are design, not incompetence.  
- **Track escalation:** spikes in nuisance often precede overt suppression tactics.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🧿 🪤 🪞 🛰️ — This node sits at the intersection of transparent interference and systematic patterns, mapping nuisance-building friction.  
- **Gene Sharp — *How Nonviolent Action Works***: disruption of infrastructure as control.  
- **Kafka — *The Castle***: endless minor obstructions to sap resolve.  
- **IT Ops folklore:** “flaky tests” weaponised to burn developer time.
