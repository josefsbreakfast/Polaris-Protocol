*The felt presence of observers altering behaviour, inducing self-censorship and hesitation.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

The **Silent Witness Effect** names the way that **perceived observation** — real or imagined — shapes behaviour.  
Survivors under surveillance adapt speech, movement, and even thought to anticipated scrutiny.  
This produces self-censorship and hesitation before any overt suppression occurs, making control more efficient and less visible.  

---

## 🛰️ Mechanism  

- **Felt surveillance:** even subtle cues of being watched (CC cameras, read receipts, repeated “coincidences”) change conduct.  
- **Pre-emptive self-editing:** survivor moderates language, avoids escalation, or withholds complaints out of fear of reprisal.  
- **Ambient coercion:** no direct instruction is needed; the observer’s presence alone enforces compliance.  
- **Energy siphon:** constant self-monitoring drains cognitive and emotional bandwidth.  

---

## 🫀 Impacts  

- **Behavioural narrowing:** reduced risk-taking, muted speech, curtailed help-seeking.  
- **Isolation:** sense that allies may also be watching, eroding trust.  
- **Hypervigilance:** attention diverted from substance to imagined optics.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Counter-Containment  

- **Name the gaze:** explicitly acknowledge the sense of being watched.  
- **Anchor outside:** hold conversations or decision-making in trusted offline or non-recorded spaces.  
- **Collect evidence:** record when and where observation cues appear.  
- **Reclaim performance:** turn observation into documentation on your own terms.
