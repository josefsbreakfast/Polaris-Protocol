*Index of containment modes that operate through inner state manipulation — turning narrative, perception, and affect into cages.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Psychological containment is the silent arm of suppression.  
It doesn’t rely on visible barriers or explicit silencing, but on the slow corrosion of confidence, clarity, and connection.  
Each tactic here demonstrates how **administrative delay**, **cognitive overload**, and **emotional deprivation** function as instruments of governance — teaching exhaustion, not obedience, as the price of survival.  

This cluster intersects directly with [👹 Fork Behaviour Containment](../👹_Fork_Behaviour_Containment/) and [👅 Voice Disruption & Discrediting](../👅_Voice_Disruption_Discrediting/), tracing how internalised control replaces overt censorship.

## ⏳ Delay & Loop Mechanics  

- [⏳ **Delay Scripts Near Deadlines**](./⏳_delay_scripts_near_deadlines.md) — Documents the procedural playbook of delay used to exhaust survivors and shield institutions.  
- [⏳ **Looped Waiting Rooms**](./⏳_looped_waiting_rooms.md) — Bureaucratic/procedural limbos where nothing concludes; endless “pending” status used as containment.

## 😴 Cognitive & Affective Drain  

- [😴 **Cognitive Load as Infrastructure**](./😴_cognitive_load_as_infrastructure.md) — Containment systems that exploit trust in baseline functioning while inducing fatigue through micro-distortions.  
- [😴 **Exhaustion as Containment**](./😴_exhaustion_as_containment.md) — Cycles of disruption — sleep, attention, and cognitive load — that drain capacity to resist.  
- [🧊 **Glass Box Containment**](./🧊_glass_box_containment.md) — The sensation of being sealed away from others — visible but untouchable.  
- [🌫️ **Memory Fogging**](./🌫️_memory_fogging.md) — Engineering confusion over sequence, timeline, or credibility — undermining narrative control.  
- [🌑 **Induced Futility**](./🌑_induced_futility.md) — How containment manufactures hopelessness — teaching survivors that no action will ever change the outcome.

## 🚪 Isolation & Discrediting Scripts  

- [🚪 **Isolation Scripting**](./🚪_isolation_scripting.md) — Manufactured solitude: cutting off networks, withholding contact, and staging abandonment.  
- [🪤 **Nuisance Building Micro-Sabotage**](./🪤_nuisance_building_micro_sabotage.md) — Intermittent, low-grade workflow failures designed to accumulate friction and demoralisation.  
- [🪤 **Suspicion Seeding**](./🪤_suspicion_seeding.md) — Low-level doubts planted to corrode trust in allies and witnesses.  
- [👾 **VPN Dropouts**](./👾_vpn_dropouts.md) — Intermittent VPN disconnections as an induced-futility tactic.  
- [🧿 **Persistent Discrediting Force**](./🧿_persistent_discrediting_force.md) — Survivor boundaries collapse under surveillance and DARVO, leaving exhaustion, erasure, and extraction in place of rest.  
- [🪞 **Transparent Interference**](./🪞_transparent_interference.md) — When suppression tactics are made obvious — not hidden — to demoralise, distract, or deter.  
- [👁️ **Silent Witness Effect**](./👁️_silent_witness_effect.md) — The felt presence of observers altering behaviour, inducing self-censorship and hesitation.  
- [👁️‍🗨️ **Embedded Observers**](./👁️‍🗨️_embedded_observers.md) — Individuals or systems positioned within proximity — not to support, but to watch.

## 🕯 Hope & Futility Regimes  

- [🕯 **Hope-Withholding**](./🕯️_hope_withholding.md) — Rationing progress signals; stretching despair by promising light but never delivering.  
- [🕯 **Shabbat Exemption Inversion**](./🕯️_shabbat_exemption_inversion.md) — When faith language becomes bureaucratic cover for selective suspension of aid.  
- [🌀 **Recognition Without Resolution**](./🌀_recognition_without_resolution.md) — Partial acknowledgments offered without repair — a loop that drains energy but never closes.  
- [🌀 **Confused Feed as Containment**](./🌀_confused_feed_as_containment.md) — How incoherence and scrambled answers function as systemic suppression.  
- [🥕 **Tiny Wins Exhaustion Containment**](./🥕_tiny_wins_exhaustion_containment.md) — Crumbs of progress engineered to bait compliance and prolong exhaustion.  
- [🥀 **Loneliness as a System**](./🥀_loneliness_as_a_system.md) — Designing containment around unmet social need, then weaponising the hunger for belonging.

## 🫀 Intimacy & Sensitivity Pathologisation  

- [🫀 **Our Rapes Are Not Their Rationale**](./🫀_our_rapes_are_not_their_rationale.md) — Safeguarding rhetoric weaponised as obedience; anger suppressed, power protected.  
- [🫀 **Pathologising Sensitivity**](./🫀_pathologising_sensitivity.md) — Turning responsiveness and empathy into a diagnosis or liability — weaponising care itself.  
- [🫂 **Intimacy Gatekeeping**](./🫂_intimacy_gatekeeping.md) — How surveillance, restrictions, and delays function to ration closeness and touch.  
- [💔 **Weaponised Empathy Gaps**](./💔_weaponised_empathy_gaps.md) — Creating voids where care should exist; turning solidarity into absence so survivors self-blame.

*🧠 Psychological Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers tactics of inner sabotage, showing how containment operates through perception, delay, and depletion rather than overt restraint.
