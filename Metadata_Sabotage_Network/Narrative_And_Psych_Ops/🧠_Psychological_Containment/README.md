*Psychological_Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents one layer of metadata sabotage and its counter-responses.  

> 📡 Cross-references:  
> - [Metadata Sabotage Network](../../) — evidentiary core  
> - [Disruption Kit](../../../Disruption_Kit/) — systemic suppression + counter-nudges  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
