**First created:** 2025-09-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Index of containment modes that operate through inner state manipulation — turning narrative, perception, and affect into cages*  

---

## Catalogue of Tactics  

- **🌑 Induced Futility**  
  Engineered hopelessness: teaching that no action alters outcomes, so effort collapses.  

- **💔 Weaponised Empathy Gaps**  
  Creating voids where care should exist; turning solidarity into absence, so survivors self-blame.  

- **🚪 Isolation Scripting**  
  Manufactured solitude: cutting off networks, withholding contact, staging abandonment.  

- **🪤 Suspicion Seeding**  
  Low-level doubts planted to corrode trust in allies and witnesses.  

- **😴 Exhaustion as Containment**  
  Cycles of disruption (sleep, attention, cognitive load) that drain capacity to resist.  

- **🌀 Recognition Without Resolution**  
  Partial acknowledgments offered without repair — a loop that drains energy but never closes.  

- **👁️ Silent Witness Effect**  
  The felt presence of observers altering behaviour, inducing self-censorship and hesitation.  

- **🌫️ Memory Fogging**  
  Engineering confusion over sequence, timeline, or credibility; undermines narrative control.  

- **🕯️ Hope-Withholding**  
  Rationing progress signals; stretching despair by promising light but never delivering.  

- **🫀 Pathologising Sensitivity**  
  Casting heightened awareness (a survival trait) as weakness or disorder.  

- **⏳ Looped Waiting Rooms**  
  Bureaucratic/procedural limbos where nothing concludes; endless “pending” status.  

- **🥀 Loneliness as a System**  
  Designing containment around unmet social need, then weaponising the hunger for belonging.

*🧠 Psychological Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It gathers tactics of inner sabotage, where containment is enacted through the psyche rather than physical chains.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
