*When suppression tactics are made obvious — not hidden — to demoralise, distract or deter.*

---

## 📜 Description  

Most interference patterns aim to be covert.  
**Transparent Interference** flips that logic: the manipulation is made blatant, even theatrical, so the target notices it.  
This is not “sloppy tradecraft” but an effect: it seeds doubt, humiliation, self-censorship, and exhaustion.  

Examples include:

- Neutral queries returning overt sexual or unrelated content.  
- Timed glitching coinciding with sensitive work.  
- Interface anomalies that appear personalised or mocking.  

---

## 🗂 Typology  

- **Demoralisation:** bluntly signalling “we’re watching” to induce self-limitation.  
- **Noise Flooding:** saturating a query or space with absurd or explicit content to degrade trust.  
- **Learned Helplessness:** making the manipulation visible to train resignation (“there’s no point fighting”).  
- **Cognitive Overload:** forcing the target to spend time documenting obvious anomalies instead of progressing work.  

---

## 🔍 Forensic Markers  

- The same query in incognito or on another network returns normal results.  
- Blatant anomalies appear shortly after triggering keywords or research spikes.  
- Pattern of escalation: subtle interference → overt substitution → sudden normalcy.

## 📝 Logging Guidance  

Add a **Transparency Level** field to field logs:  
`Low` (subtle), `Medium` (detectable but deniable), `High` (blatant or theatrical).  

Correlate transparency spikes with:

- Topic sensitivity (e.g. banned media, political donors).  
- Device / network context.  
- Timing of related communications or posts.

*Transparent Interference* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the deliberate use of overt manipulation tactics as a suppression vector.
