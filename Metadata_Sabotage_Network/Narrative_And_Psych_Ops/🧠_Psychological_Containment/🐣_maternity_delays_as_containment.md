## 📑 Forensic Notes  
- Checkpoint and referral delays weaponise maternity.  
- International law (Fourth Geneva Convention, Art. 55 & 59) obliges the occupying power to ensure medical access.  
- Documented cases show women giving birth at checkpoints, miscarriages from delays, and systemic obstruction.  

## 🧠 Psychological Containment  
Delays are not neutral. They are calculated to exhaust.  
In maternity, the system turns biology into a site of control.  

## 🎛 Survivor Voice Fidelity  
“They held me at the barrier when I was in labour. They said: wait. They made my pain a form to be processed.”
