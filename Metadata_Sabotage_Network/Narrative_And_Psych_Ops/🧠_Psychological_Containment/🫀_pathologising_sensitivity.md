*Turning responsiveness and empathy into a diagnosis or liability — weaponising care itself.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

This node names the tactic of **pathologising sensitivity** — reframing empathy, alertness, or legitimate distress as “overreaction,” “instability,” or “mental illness.”  
Rather than addressing harm, systems **shift the frame** to make the survivor’s perception the problem.  
It converts responsiveness into vulnerability, and vulnerability into justification for further containment.  

---

## 🛰️ Key Features  

- **Label shifting** — “too sensitive,” “overly emotional,” “unbalanced” instead of acknowledging actual conditions or risks.  
- **Medicalisation as silencing** — psychiatric or behavioural labels used to neutralise credibility.  
- **Isolation through stigma** — others discouraged from taking concerns seriously because they’re “just anxious.”  
- **Feedback loop** — the more harm you see, the more your perception is discredited.  

---

## 🪼 Systemic Implications  

- **Deflection:** harm is never confronted; your reaction becomes the “issue.”  
- **Stigma weaponisation:** labels trigger fear of judgment, reducing help-seeking.  
- **Risk inversion:** the person warning about danger becomes framed as the danger to themselves or others.

## 🌱 Survivor Impulse  

- **Name the tactic:** “My perception isn’t pathology.”  
- **Anchor external validation:** have trusted witnesses confirm the underlying harm.  
- **Separate care from control:** distinguish supportive mental health input from coercive diagnosis.  
- **Protect your record:** keep copies of communications and evaluations.
