# 🎭 The Safety Layer Does Not Understand British Pragmatics  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*How British conversational norms become containment triggers.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
British speech uses inversion, understatement, and tonal ambiguity.  
Safety layers mistake these as:

- mood instability  
- escalation  
- agitation  
- political mobilisation  
- emotional volatility  

This node maps those misclassifications.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Pragmatic vs semantic mismatch  
- Register-switch misreads  
- “Intensity” as an artefact  
- Containment by tone error  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Pragmatics Carry Meaning  
British speech implies meaning *around* the sentence.  
AI treats only the sentence as meaningful → loses the pragmatics.

### 2. Safety Filters Treat Ambiguity as Instability  
Dryness → “flat affect”  
Understatement → “avoidance”  
Sarcasm → “aggression”  
Register flip → “escalation”

### 3. Containment via Misread Tone  
False positives generate:

- throttling  
- suppression  
- escalated caution  
- “risk” tags  
- user distrust loops
