*How surveillance, restrictions and delays function to ration closeness and touch.*

## ✨ Overview  

Containment doesn’t always look like fences.  
Sometimes it looks like **withheld access to closeness** — a slow drip of permissions, proximity, and hope that leaves survivors isolated even while surrounded by people.  

Whether or not anyone has signed a memo about it, the effect is the same:  
**intimacy becomes rationed**.  

---

## 🧿 Key Features  

- **Delayed contact** — relationships slowed or prevented by barriers, bureaucracy, or “security.”  
- **Withheld access** — being able to see or imagine someone but unable to reach them.  
- **False neutrality** — the barrier is framed as “process” or “risk management,” not control.  

---

## 🥭 Systemic Implications  

- **Isolation as control:** the longer someone is kept from warmth or touch, the easier they are to exhaust.  
- **Discrediting by bait:** sexual frustration can be used to provoke statements, then weaponised.  
- **Effect over intent:** even “unintended” delays still act as a form of rationing.

## 🌱 Survivor Impulse  

- Name the gatekeeping: “This isn’t my failure; this is a barrier.”  
- Anchor your own agency: private, consensual intimacy is still yours to choose.  
- Protect your words: don’t hand ammunition to a hostile feed.  
- Seek cracks: small, safe, real connections are proof the barrier is not absolute.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🫂 🧠 🕯️  
- **Michel Foucault — *The History of Sexuality***: regulation of intimacy as regulation of power.  
- **Angela Davis — *Are Prisons Obsolete?***: family and conjugal visits as contested terrain of control.  
- **Charlotte Perkins Gilman — *The Yellow Wallpaper***: enforced isolation disguised as care.  
- **Refugee camp and detention settings:** proximity without touch as a tactic of exhaustion.

*🫂 Intimacy Gatekeeping* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how isolation and delays can function as containment even without explicit policy.
