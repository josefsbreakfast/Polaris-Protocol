# 😴 Cognitive Load as Infrastructure  
**First created:** 2025-09-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-25  
*Containment systems that exploit trust in baseline functioning while inducing fatigue through micro-distortions*  

---

## 🔍 Core Logic  

- **Trust in System Baseline**  
  Individuals assume institutions, platforms, and processes work as intended.  
- **Incremental Distortion**  
  Small shifts, errors, and delays are introduced while attention is split.  
- **Cognitive Depletion**  
  Fatigue makes anomalies harder to spot; exhaustion becomes a containment medium.  

---

## 🧩 Mechanisms  

- **Recognition without Resolution** → seeing glitches but never reaching closure.  
- **Exhaustion as Containment** → loops that wear down decision capacity.  
- **Induced Futility** → subtle adjustments nudge survivors to give up.  

---

## 📡 Survivor Effects  

- Self-blame for errors (“must be me, not the system”).  
- Delayed or abandoned escalation.  
- Shrinking ability to track cumulative sabotage.

*Cognitive Load as Infrastructure* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how systemic trust is inverted into a containment medium, exploiting fatigue to sustain suppression.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
