# 😴 Cognitive Load as Infrastructure

*Containment systems that exploit trust in baseline functioning while inducing fatigue through micro-distortions.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

Containment can be built not from walls, but from **cognitive weight**.  
Every small distortion — a lag, a misfire, a contradiction — adds friction to thinking, eroding energy and attention.  
Because people trust in the baseline functionality of systems, these micro-errors accumulate unnoticed until fatigue becomes **the containment medium itself**.  

The architecture of exhaustion hides in the ordinary.

## 🛰️ Mechanisms  

- **Trust in the baseline** → faith that processes work “as intended.”  
- **Incremental distortion** → minor shifts and delays that blur reliability.  
- **Cognitive depletion** → fatigue reduces anomaly detection and narrows focus.  
- **Recognition without resolution** → awareness rises, closure never comes.  
- **Induced futility** → energy drains until resistance feels pointless.

## 🌩️ Survivor Effects  

- **Self-blame for failure:** “It must be me, not the system.”  
- **Delayed escalation:** attention too split to sustain complaint cycles.  
- **Shrinkage of focus:** survivor’s horizon narrows to immediate function, not system analysis.  
- **Containment by fatigue:** exhaustion substitutes for restraint.

## 🐦‍🔥 Counter-Containment  

- **Map anomalies** — record even small irregularities; they compound.  
- **Automate sanity checks** — scripts, alerts, or journaling to externalise memory.  
- **Time-stamp fatigue** — note when exhaustion spikes; often correlates with interference cycles.  
- **Reinstate rest as defiance** — recovery is infrastructure, too.

## 🌌 Constellations  

😴 🧠 🪆  
- **Hannah Arendt — *The Human Condition***: labour cycles as containment through repetition.  
- **Lauren Berlant — *Cruel Optimism***: attachment to broken systems as slow exhaustion.  
- **Franz Kafka — *The Castle***: endless admin loops as cognitive erosion.  
- **Byung-Chul Han — *The Burnout Society***: fatigue as structural design, not symptom.

*😴 Cognitive Load as Infrastructure* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how systemic trust is inverted into a containment medium, using micro-distortions and accumulated fatigue to sustain suppression.
