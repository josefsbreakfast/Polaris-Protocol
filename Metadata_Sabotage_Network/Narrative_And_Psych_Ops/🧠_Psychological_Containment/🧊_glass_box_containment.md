# 🧊 Glass Box Containment  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*The sensation of being sealed away from others — visible but untouchable.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

Some forms of isolation are opaque: closed doors, dark rooms, vanished networks.  
Others are transparent: you can see the world, glimpse those you want to reach, yet you cannot cross.  

This is the **glass box**.  
It is one of the most disorienting containment modes because it keeps survivors *near but unreachable* — visible to others, but acoustically and emotionally sealed.  

---

## 🛰️ Key Features  

- **Transparency as harm:** visibility disguises exclusion. You can see out; they can see in — but no one can bridge the wall.  
- **False neutrality:** the barrier looks “normal” or “technical,” masking deliberate separation.  
- **Self-doubt loop:** the clarity of the box breeds confusion — “If I can see them, why can’t they hear me?”  

---

## 🌩️ Systemic Implications  

- **Containment by proximity:** closeness becomes a mechanism of cruelty.  
- **Isolation theatre:** outsiders may see interaction and assume inclusion.  
- **Barrier maintenance:** periodic “cracks” (a message, a glance) create plausible deniability while preserving distance.

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Impulse  

- **Name the box:** it is not a personal failure; it is an engineered barrier.  
- **Notice the cracks:** brief signals of contact are evidence of interference, not illusion.  
- **Reclaim internal space:** the glass confines reach, not mind. Clarity can still become witness.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🧊 🧠 🫂 🚪  
- **Franz Kafka — *The Castle***: perpetual proximity to power without entry.  
- **Samuel Beckett — *Endgame***: transparent isolation as existential theatre.  
- **bell hooks — *All About Love***: the cost of seeing care yet being denied it.  
- **Performance & installation art:** glass cages, transparent rooms — metaphor made physical.

*🧊 Glass Box Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the survivor experience of enforced distance — proximity without contact — and frames it as a systemic containment strategy.
