# 🧊 Glass Box Containment  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*The sensation of being sealed away from others, visible but untouchable*  

---

## 🌌 Overview  
Some forms of isolation are opaque: doors closed, lights off, nothing visible.  
Others are transparent: you can see through to the world, even glimpse those you want to be with, yet you cannot cross.  

This is the **glass box**.  
It is one of the most disorienting containment modes, because it keeps survivors *near but unreachable*.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Transparency as harm**: you can see connection but cannot touch it.  
- **False neutrality**: the barrier looks invisible, yet it blocks completely.  
- **Self-doubt loop**: the glass makes survivors question whether the distance is “real” or “in their head.”  

---

## 🌀 Systemic Implications  
- **Containment by proximity**: engineered distance is more cruel than absence.  
- **Isolation theatre**: others may not even perceive the glass, reinforcing the survivor’s sense of being “the only one.”  
- **Barrier maintenance**: tiny cracks (a call, a glance, a moment) prove the box is not natural, but actively upheld.

## 🌱 Survivor Impulse  
- Name the box: it is not you, it is a barrier.  
- Watch for cracks: small connections are evidence the wall is not permanent.  
- Remember: visibility without touch is *not* failure — it’s proof the system fears closeness.

*Glass Box Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the survivor experience of enforced distance — proximity without contact — and frames it as a systemic tool of suppression.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
