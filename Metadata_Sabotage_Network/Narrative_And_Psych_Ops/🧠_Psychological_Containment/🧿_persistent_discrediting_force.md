*Survivor boundaries collapse under surveillance and DARVO, leaving exhaustion, erasure, and extraction in place of rest.*

I feel like a package of goods; I don’t feel like a person.  
...  
I am STILL not afforded the respect and candour of an honest answer to the most basic question:  

*Are the sealed documents which form the court record of my CSA/rape case safe?*  

And this is after the evidence of the Google bombing, suggesting a data breach.  
Even with proof of compromise, I am denied the candour of a clear answer.  
The silence itself is structural.

*Persistent Discrediting Force* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how survivor boundaries are collapsed through surveillance, record erasure, predator tolerance, extraction of adulthood, denial of rest, and DARVO. Even when survivors resist, the discrediting force persists — nudging others, exhausting refusal, demanding impossible endurance, and denying the most basic candour about safety of sealed records.
