*Low-level doubts planted to corrode trust in allies and witnesses.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

**Suspicion seeding** plants subtle cues that corrode trust among survivors, witnesses, or allies.  
It rarely delivers an outright accusation. Instead, it sprinkles just enough ambiguity to make solidarity feel dangerous, contact risky, and testimony suspect.  
The tactic feeds off the human drive to protect against betrayal — making survivors isolate themselves long before an actual breach occurs.  

---

## 🛰️ Mechanisms  

- **Whispered doubt:** hints or insinuations about ally motives (“they’re compromised”).  
- **Contradictory signals:** small inconsistencies amplified to suggest deception.  
- **Algorithmic framing:** selective content or search results implying unreliability.  
- **Mimic / smear loops:** false “inside” info to corrode key relationships.  

---

## 🌩️ Impacts  

- **Trust erosion:** allies appear duplicitous; survivor’s support base shrinks.  
- **Isolation:** fear of infiltration leads to withdrawal.  
- **Cognitive overload:** energy diverted to vetting others instead of pursuing the core work.  
- **Containment by suspicion:** solidarity dissolves before it can escalate.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Impulse  

- **Name the tactic:** “this is suspicion seeding” — reduce its invisible power.  
- **Anchor in evidence:** check facts slowly; refuse rushed judgments.  
- **Keep allies in the loop:** transparency and shared logs break the loop.  
- **Document insinuations:** screenshots, timestamps, and origin of claims.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🪤 🧠 🪞 🧿  
- **Hannah Arendt — *Origins of Totalitarianism***: atomisation as precondition for control.  
- **Erving Goffman — *Stigma***: managing spoiled identity under suspicion.  
- **Psychological ops manuals:** trust disruption as primary destabilisation vector.  
- **Digital disinformation campaigns:** micro-targeted rumours to fracture groups.
