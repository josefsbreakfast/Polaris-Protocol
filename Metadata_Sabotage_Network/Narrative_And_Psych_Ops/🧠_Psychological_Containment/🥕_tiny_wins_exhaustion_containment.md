## 📑 Forensic Notes  
- Small approvals given (a single permit, one truck of aid) amidst systemic blockade.  
- Creates illusion of progress while maintaining broader chokehold.  
- Psychological tactic: baiting compliance.  

## 🧠 Psychological Containment  
The “tiny win” is engineered to keep survivors waiting, investing, exhausting themselves.  
Containment is extended by crumbs.  

## 🎛 Survivor Voice Fidelity  
“They let one bag through so you keep waiting with the rest of the truck. They ration hope into exhaustion.”
