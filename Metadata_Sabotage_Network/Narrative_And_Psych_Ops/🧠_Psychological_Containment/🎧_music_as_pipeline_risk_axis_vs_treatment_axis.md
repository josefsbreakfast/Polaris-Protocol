## 🛰️ Orientation  

Music is not just background noise in radicalisation stories; it is often **the ambience of recruitment**, the tempo of belonging, the emotional carrier wave for grievance. White-power punk scenes, jihadist nasheeds, and neo-Nazi labels built around family networks all treat music as a core organising infrastructure, not an accessory.  [oai_citation:0‡Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01639625.2024.2380738?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

At the same time, **streaming platforms quietly reshape listening habits** through opaque recommendation engines that already steer mood, memory, and identity exploration at scale. UK government-commissioned research notes widespread anxiety that these algorithms not only reflect taste but actively *produce* it.  [oai_citation:1‡GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-into-the-impact-of-streaming-services-algorithms-on-music-consumption/the-impact-of-algorithmically-driven-recommendation-systems-on-music-consumption-and-production-a-literature-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

This node sketches a diagnostic axis:

- **Pipeline axis** – how music functions as a recruitment and identity-building channel.  
- **Risk axis** – how listening patterns may be read as *signals* of radicalisation.  
- **Treatment axis** – the speculative (and partially visible) move to treat playlists themselves as a *lever* of behavioural management.

The focus is not on pathologising individual listeners, but on **the growing temptation to treat intimate cultural habits as adjustable knobs in a security stack**.

## 🎚️ Pipeline Axis — Music as Recruitment Infrastructure  

**1. Subculture as onboarding system**  
- White-power music scenes show a long-running pattern: gigs, labels, and online archives are used to recruit and socialise youth into racist and neo-Nazi milieus; music becomes the gateway into a broader ideological community.  [oai_citation:2‡Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01639625.2024.2380738?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- These spaces often involve:  
  - festivals framed as “family friendly”  
  - informal merch and donation systems  
  - discographies that double as ideological curricula  

**2. Jihadist soundtracks**  
- Nasheeds (jihadist hymns) operate as a **shared emotional language** for jihadist culture, creating a sense of unity and moral elevation; analysts describe them as “the soundtrack of jihad”, inseparable from propaganda videos and offline mobilisation.  [oai_citation:3‡U.S. Department of War](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jun/09/2002313323/-1/-1/1/ALVI.PDF?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

**3. Platform-era pipelines**  
- YouTube and other platforms have historically allowed extremist music to **remain discoverable and monetisable**, with recommendation systems sometimes nudging users from “edgy” content into explicit neo-Nazi material.  [oai_citation:4‡VICE](https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-white-power-music-continues-to-thrive-on-youtube-v25n1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- In effect, music becomes:  
  - an *on-ramp* to more explicit material  
  - a way of testing who responds strongly enough to be pulled deeper into the funnel  

The pipeline axis is where **music is actively weaponised by extremist actors**. It is already well-documented, even if not centrally regulated.

## 🧬 Risk Axis — Music as Diagnostic Signal  

There is a quieter, less visible axis where **states, universities, and vendors begin treating music behaviour as *data*** rather than just culture.

**1. Case narratives & Prevent practice**  
- Channel and Prevent case materials (and critical reviews of Prevent) show that young people’s **music, gaming, and media habits** sometimes appear in risk narratives: e.g. “extreme” music, nasheeds, or lyrics are cited as corroboration of an ideological trajectory rather than contextualised as experimentation or identity work.  [oai_citation:5‡CIDOB](https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/eu-policies-preventing-violent-extremism-new-paradigm-action?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

**2. Research and tooling infrastructure**  
- Centres like **CENTRIC** (Sheffield Hallam) build tools for analysing “heterogeneous online content” – text, images, video, and potentially audio – to detect patterns associated with radicalisation.  [oai_citation:6‡Sheffield Hallam University](https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/babak-akhgar?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- EU-level work (RAN and its successor, the EU Knowledge Hub on Prevention of Radicalisation) explicitly encourages **data-driven situational awareness** around online radicalisation and media ecosystems.  [oai_citation:7‡Migration and Home Affairs](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/radicalisation-awareness-network-ran_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

Even where music is not named, the **technical and bureaucratic scaffolding** exists to ingest streaming or platform data as just another behavioural signal in a risk model.

**3. Risk-axis harms**  
- **Opacity** – individuals rarely know if their listening history is being interpreted as evidence of “risk” or “susceptibility”.  
- **Category drift** – music associated with grief, minority identity, or political anger can be misread as extremism, especially when analysts lack cultural literacy.  
- **Survivor distortion** – for traumatised or neurodivergent listeners, specific tracks or genres can be self-regulation tools; reclassifying those as “risk factors” erases the underlying distress.

The risk axis is where **playlists start to be seen as diagnostic charts** rather than personal soundtracks.

## 🛠️ Treatment Axis — Playlist as Behavioural Intervention  

This is the axis that is largely **speculative in the open record**, but structurally very plausible.

### 1. Technical affordance  

Streaming recommenders already:  

- profile mood, tempo preference, and time-of-day usage;  [oai_citation:8‡GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-into-the-impact-of-streaming-services-algorithms-on-music-consumption/the-impact-of-algorithmically-driven-recommendation-systems-on-music-consumption-and-production-a-literature-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- infer micro-segments (“sad girl at 2am”, “gym drill”, “nostalgic 00s emo kid”);  
- adapt to *avoid* content flagged as “skipped” or “disliked”.

The same machinery can, in principle, be tuned for **CVE-style objectives**:

- reduce exposure to certain genres, artists, or keywords;  
- seed counter-narratives or “resilience” tracks into autoplay playlists;  
- subtly shift a user’s sonic environment away from high-intensity or ideologically marked material.

### 2. Policy & research drift  

Pieces of this are already present in public-facing work:

- RAN and similar practitioner networks discuss **youth interventions** that use music and games to build resilience and provide attractive alternatives to extremist content, even if they stop short of saying “we directly hack your playlist”.  [oai_citation:9‡Migration and Home Affairs](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/radicalisation-awareness-network-ran_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Governments have commissioned research into **streaming algorithms’ influence on behaviour**, not just on revenue – creating the evidentiary basis for later “safety” interventions.  [oai_citation:10‡GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-into-the-impact-of-streaming-services-algorithms-on-music-consumption/the-impact-of-algorithmically-driven-recommendation-systems-on-music-consumption-and-production-a-literature-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

From there, it is a short conceptual step to:  

> “If we believe certain musical ecosystems *contribute* to radicalisation risk, then deliberately shifting a person’s feed is a legitimate preventative measure.”

### 3. Ethical fracture lines  

Using playlists as treatment collides with several fault-lines:

- **Informed consent** – people are not being told their cultural life is being used as an intervention target in a security context.  
- **False positives & bias** – marginalised communities whose music already gets racialised (e.g. drill, nasheeds, protest music) are at higher risk of being nudged away from their own culture.  
- **Containment vs care** – algorithmic “calming” of a distressed person’s music feed can operate as **soft sedation** of dissent rather than meaningful support.  

The treatment axis risks turning **“what you listen to” into a quiet therapeutic-surveillance surface** that can be tuned without your knowledge.

## 🧩 Institutional Ecosystem — Hallam, Sheffield, Nottingham (Sketch)  

This section is deliberately high-level; it’s about **where this work could sit**, not accusing specific labs of undeclared projects.

- **Sheffield Hallam / CENTRIC**  
  - Builds multi-modal detection tools and LEA dashboards for terrorism, cybercrime, and public order. Music and audio are not centre-stage in their public materials, but the *architecture* clearly supports heterogeneous content analysis.  [oai_citation:11‡Sheffield Hallam University](https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/babak-akhgar?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

- **University of Sheffield**  
  - Heavily involved in **online hate, recommendation systems, and extremism-related research** under the Alan Turing Institute umbrella. This is where experimentation with recommender tweaks “for safety” is most likely to be framed as data science rather than security.  [oai_citation:12‡CIDOB](https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/eu-policies-preventing-violent-extremism-new-paradigm-action?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

- **University of Nottingham & Prevent debates**  
  - Prominent in UK debates about Prevent, radicalisation, and higher-education duties; part of a policy ecosystem that already treats **students’ cultural and political expression** as potential indicators within safeguarding frameworks.  [oai_citation:13‡Parliament News](https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/commons-committees/home-affairs/Correspondence-17-19/Radicalisation-the-counter-narrative-and-identifying-the-tipping-point-government-response-Eighth-Report-26-17-Cm-9555.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

Together, these institutions sit at the junction of:

- **theory of radicalisation**,  
- **data infrastructures for detection**, and  
- **policy climates that legitimise behavioural interventions**.

That is exactly the kind of triad from which a closed-door “playlist intervention pilot” could emerge, even if it never appears in a tidy journal article.

## ⚠️ Risk Map — Red Flags & Failure Modes  

Use this as a quick diagnostic checklist when you suspect a **music-based containment loop**:

1. **Sudden tonal shift** in recommended music across multiple platforms (e.g. “angry” or political music quietly disappears, replaced with “wellness” / “productivity” playlists) that does not match your explicit actions.  
2. **Convergence across vendors** – Spotify, YouTube, and TikTok all start pushing similar “calm down / productivity / romance arc” narratives, despite different prior histories.  
3. **Safeguarding language creep** – university, employer, or practitioner documents start referencing “high-risk media consumption” or “concerning listening habits” without clear definitions.  
4. **Prevent / Channel contact followed by feed changes** – an individual has contact with CT / safeguarding frameworks, and notices perceptible shifts in musical or video recommendations afterwards.  
5. **Pathologising of coping tracks** – songs that function as trauma regulation, cultural continuity, or grief rituals for the person are reframed externally as “risk music”.

The key harm is not just surveillance; it is **the quiet erosion of one of the few self-directed sensory spaces people may still have**.

## 🌿 Questions for Fieldwork & Survivor-First Inquiry  

For Polaris and allied projects, some guiding questions:

- **Signal literacy**  
  - How do we distinguish between **exploratory / identity music** and **organised extremist infrastructures** in a way that doesn’t pathologise minority culture or political anger?  
  - What would a *survivor-designed* taxonomy of “concerning” music ecosystems look like, if it existed at all?

- **Transparency & consent**  
  - What would meaningful **notice and opt-out** look like for any music-based intervention in CT / safeguarding frameworks?  
  - Can we design **non-carceral uses** of listening data (e.g. self-chosen harm-reduction tools, trauma-informed playlists) that are explicitly firewalled from security use?

- **Counter-design**  
  - How might users audit their own feeds to detect suspicious convergence or nudging?  
  - Could we prototype **“playlist checksum” tools** that log when a platform’s behaviour deviates significantly from the local history in ways that correlate with institutional events (complaints, Prevent referrals, etc.)?

- **Archiving & testimony**  
  - When people describe feeling like their soundtrack has been “smoothed out” or repurposed into a romance / wellness / productivity arc, how do we preserve these accounts as **testimony**, not delusion?  
  - What forms of **collective listening log** (zines, oral histories, encrypted shared archives) could capture these experiences without exposing individuals to more risk?

## ✴️ Polaris Hooks  

- Treat this node as a **bridge** between *Algorithmic Endocrinology* and *Ouroborotic Violence*: music is both a hormone-like regulatory signal and a recruitment vector.  
- Link forward to any node that documents **rom-com-ification of feeds**, “auntie-mediated” nudges, or **productivity / wellness containment loops**.  
- In field logs, explicitly invite:  

> “Has your soundtrack changed in a way that feels like someone else is driving?”  

Those stories are not just quirks of taste; they are **early-warning signals of playlist-as-policy**.
