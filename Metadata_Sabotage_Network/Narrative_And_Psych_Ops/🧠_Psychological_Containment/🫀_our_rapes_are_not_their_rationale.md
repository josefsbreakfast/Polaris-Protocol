*Safeguarding rhetoric weaponised as obedience; anger suppressed, power protected.*

## ✨ Overview  

**Obedience does not protect women or girls.**  
It protects power.  

Our rapes are not their stories.  
Our rapes are not their excuses.  
Our rapes are not their rationale.  

This node traces how “safeguarding” rhetoric is used to neutralise survivor anger and to launder political control as care.  
The cultural script rewards fragility but punishes fury.  
Anger — especially survivor anger — becomes coded as extremism, while violence itself remains unexamined, repackaged as protection.

## 🛰️ Mechanisms  

### 🧨 Platform Containment  

> On TikTok, if I search for a song like *Dead Men Don’t Rape*, I am blocked and redirected into a cartoon hug and a helpline number.  

If the system wanted to help, a small dialogue box might suffice.  
Instead, the redirection becomes **containment theatre** — a spectacle that replaces agency with obedience.  

The message is clear:  
- I am allowed to be broken and held.  
- I am not allowed to be angry.  
- I am not allowed to want vengeance.  

Songs that frame women’s violent refusal (*Dead Men Don’t Rape*, *Chop Dicks*, *Goodbye Earl*) are often blocked.  
Songs and feeds steeped in overt sadism (*Mind Games*, fox hunting torture, war violence, cruelty against children) flow freely.  

This is not neutral safeguarding.  
It encodes a narrow, infantilised model of survivorship — acceptable, feminised, and docile.

### 🐝 Gendered Enforcement  

It also binds male survivors: they are only permitted to appear fragile — never angry, never agentic.  
Yet to appear fragile is to appear “too feminine”; what option do they have but silence?  

How can one pretend that violence of such an internal nature has not affected them?  

This pattern aligns with **Prevent** logics after 2016: anger itself coded as extremism.  
It is soaked in neoconservative and far-right values of “traditional family” and “proper victimhood.”

### 🫀 Political Co-option  

> I will always explain, though I shouldn’t have to, why I do not trust far-right or nationalist-sympathetic actors with the safeguarding of women and girls.  

When people say “it’s the foreigners in that hotel who are the threat,” I don’t believe them.  

- They do not respect survivors who are not white girls.  
- They do not care about many white girls either.  
- They do not care about white men as perpetrators.  

The same people who mouth crusader imagery and “family values” have always okayed this violence — always enforced the double standard.  

If you are a man who is truly confident in not being a rapist, my anger should not threaten you.  
Even if I express the sentiment that *dead men don’t rape*, if you are innocent, you should not feel fear.  
If you do, that is your complicity showing.  

I can almost hear someone saying, “women don’t like this either.”  
Ask that woman why she fears her own rage.

## 🌩️ Systemic Implications  

- **Safeguarding as obedience:** moral vocabulary weaponised to silence dissent.  
- **Anger pathologised:** emotional regulation becomes political control.  
- **Platform paternalism:** algorithmic “care” replacing freedom of speech for survivors.  
- **Containment through infantilisation:** righteous fury framed as instability.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Impulse  

- **Refuse the frame:** anger is evidence of integrity, not instability.  
- **Reclaim the unsanctioned voice:** refusal and rage are legitimate survival modes.  
- **Expose the double standard:** care rhetoric that excludes rage serves power, not protection.  
- **Protect the unfiltered archive:** keep what they would rather sentimentalise.

## 🏮 Footer  

*🫀 Our Rapes Are Not Their Rationale* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how “safeguarding” rhetoric is weaponised to suppress survivor anger and enforce obedience.  
Far-right and nationalist actors use our rapes as rationale for their politics, while perpetuating the very violence they claim to oppose.
