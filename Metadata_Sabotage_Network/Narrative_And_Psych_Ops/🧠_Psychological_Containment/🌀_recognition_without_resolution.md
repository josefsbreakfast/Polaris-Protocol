*Partial acknowledgments offered without repair — a loop that drains energy but never closes.*

## ✨ Overview  

“Recognition without resolution” names a **containment tactic** where an institution **acknowledges a grievance or request** but never completes the remedy.  
It can look like empathy, apology, or progress, but functionally it’s a **holding pattern**:  
you’re seen, but nothing changes.  

Common forms:  
- FOIA / SAR: “We acknowledge your request” → no full disclosure.  
- Complaints / safeguarding: “We take this seriously” → no corrective action.  
- Platforms: “We’re looking into it” → no outcome given.

## 🛰️ Mechanism  

- **Psychological loop:** acknowledgment satisfies a basic need for recognition, which can mute escalation — but without resolution, the problem persists.  
- **Energy siphon:** survivor invests time and hope responding to partial answers.  
- **Moral laundering:** institution signals virtue without cost or change.  

---

## 💫 Counter-Use  

- Treat **acknowledgment without closure** as evidence of containment.  
- Log exact wording, timestamps, and follow-up promises.  
- Compare initial recognition to eventual action (if any) to map the gap.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🌀 🧿 ⏳ — you’re seen but stalled.  
- **Kafka — *The Trial***: perpetual hearings without verdict.  
- **Alice Walker — *In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens***: recognition of pain without structural change.  
- **Modern FOIA theatre**: compliance signalling without disclosure.

*🌀 Recognition Without Resolution* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how partial acknowledgments, apologies, or “we’re looking into it” messages can function as psychological containment tactics, satisfying the need to be seen while obstructing actual remedy.
