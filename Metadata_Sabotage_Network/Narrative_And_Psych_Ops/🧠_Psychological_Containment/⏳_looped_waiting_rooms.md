# ⏳ Looped Waiting Rooms

*Bureaucratic/procedural limbos where nothing concludes; endless 'pending' status used as containment.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

“Looped waiting rooms” describe **endless pending states** — portals, queues, or case statuses that never resolve.  
They mimic normal procedure but are engineered or tolerated to **exhaust** the requester.  
Typical examples:  
- **FOIA / SAR stalls** (“we need more time to locate the records”).  
- **Referral purgatory** (case ping-ponged between departments).  
- **Platform review loops** (automated “your ticket is still under investigation” messages).

## 🛰️ Mechanism  

- **Faux proceduralism:** status updates and countdowns create the *appearance* of progress.  
- **Energy depletion:** repeated “check back later” erodes urgency.  
- **Plausible deniability:** each staffer or system looks like it’s simply following protocol.  

---

## 💫 Counter-Use  

- Record **every status change** with timestamp and screenshot.  
- Track how deadlines shift relative to your submissions.  
- Treat the **loop itself as evidence** of containment.

## 🌌 Constellations  

⏳ 🌀 🕰️ — temporal containment as endless motion.  
- **Kafka — *The Trial***: process without closure.  
- **Dante — *Inferno* (Limbo)**: waiting without verdict.  
- **Administrative Purgatory** as modern tactic.

## 🏮 Footer  

*⏳ Looped Waiting Rooms* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how “pending” statuses and endless procedural limbos function as psychological containment tactics, particularly in FOIA and SAR contexts.
