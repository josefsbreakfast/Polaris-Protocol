*Intermittent VPN disconnections as an induced-futility tactic*

---

## ✨ **Description**  

Psychological containment is a soft-sabotage tactic that reframes frustration as “technical glitch.”  
When protective tools (VPNs, encryption, anonymisation layers) fail without obvious cause, the user is pushed into a cycle of exposure, anxiety, and wasted time.  

This node covers the pattern where VPN connections drop out — sometimes repeatedly — especially during sensitive research or publishing tasks.

## 🛰️ **What It Looks Like**  

- VPN suddenly disconnects mid-session with no prior warning.  
- Happens disproportionately during uploads, whistleblowing prep, or OSINT research windows.  
- Device reports “normal” signal strength; ISP/OS shows no major outage.  
- Re-connecting works, but drops recur after short intervals.  
- Logs may be wiped, incomplete, or hard to export.

## 💫 **Effects on the User**  

- **Security risk:** momentary exposure of real IP, traffic and metadata.  
- **Time drain:** forces repeated reconnects, throttling urgent work.  
- **Doubt spiral:** user begins to second-guess own competence (“Is this me or them?”).  
- **Containment aura:** creates an impression of futility, slowing publication or evidence gathering without overt censorship.

*👾 Psychological Containment — VPN Dropouts* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how intermittent VPN disconnections can function as both a security vulnerability and a subtle containment tactic.
