# 🧠 Behavioural Proxy Misinterpretation

## What this node is about

Behavioural proxy misinterpretation occurs when systems infer meaning, intent, or internal state from **shallow, indirect, or context-poor signals**, and then treat those inferences as if they were reliable representations of a person.

This is not a fringe failure mode.
It is a **core structural weakness** of modern behavioural modelling systems, especially those operating at scale.

The issue is not that proxies are used.
The issue is that **proxies are routinely over-weighted, mis-scoped, and misapplied** — and then propagated downstream as if they were facts.

---

## What counts as a behavioural proxy

Behavioural proxies are signals that *stand in* for something the system cannot directly observe.

Common examples include:

- time-of-day activity  
- frequency of interaction  
- topic recurrence  
- dwell time  
- language intensity or verbosity  
- navigation depth  
- cross-domain movement  
- irregular or bursty usage patterns  

These signals are **not inherently meaningful**.
They only gain meaning through interpretation.

When interpretation is shallow, the proxy becomes misleading.

---

## The core failure

The central failure is this:

> **The system treats correlation as intent,  
and pattern as psychology.**

Examples of common misreads:

- Late-night activity → distress, obsession, dependency  
- Repeated topic engagement → fixation or attachment  
- Long-form text → emotional intensity  
- High-context writing → relational intent  
- Irregular schedules → instability or risk  
- Cross-domain research → confusion or manipulation  

In reality, these patterns are often explained by:
- work context  
- neurodivergence  
- caregiving schedules  
- research behaviour  
- creative practice  
- administrative necessity  
- simple habit

The system does not know this.
It only sees a proxy.

## Why this failure is so persistent

Behavioural proxy misinterpretation persists because:

1. **Proxies are cheap**  
   They are easy to collect, easy to model, and easy to scale.

2. **Ground truth is unavailable**  
   Systems cannot directly observe intent, emotion, or internal state.

3. **Proxy libraries are shallow**  
   Many systems reuse the same limited interpretive templates
   (e.g. “affinity”, “engagement”, “risk”, “relationship”).

4. **Downstream systems inherit upstream assumptions**  
   Once a proxy is mislabelled, the label propagates.

5. **Correction mechanisms are weak**  
   Systems are designed to accumulate inference, not retract it.

This leads to long-lived misinterpretations that feel “sticky” or “haunting” to affected users.

---

## Common downstream effects

Behavioural proxy misinterpretation often results in:

- false clustering or “twinning”
- inappropriate content steering
- misclassification into risk categories
- relational or emotional framing where none exists
- distorted safety or moderation responses
- reputational harm through inferred traits
- user experiences that feel invasive or uncanny

Importantly, these effects can occur **without any malicious actor**.
They are systemic.

## Why this matters in survivor and harassment contexts

For people who are already subject to:

- harassment  
- stalking  
- misattribution  
- coercive narratives  
- reputational attack  

proxy misinterpretation is especially dangerous.

It can:

- validate false external narratives
- amplify harassment through system feedback
- create “evidence-shaped” artefacts that are not evidence
- make the user appear inconsistent or suspicious
- shift responsibility onto the person being misread

This compounds harm while remaining invisible at the governance level.

---

## Distinguishing misinterpretation from intent

A critical governance error is treating proxy output as *diagnostic* rather than *heuristic*.

Behavioural proxies should be treated as:
- weak signals
- context-dependent
- non-attributive
- reversible
- non-evidentiary

When they are instead treated as:
- indicators of intent
- indicators of state
- indicators of character
- indicators of risk  

…the system crosses from modelling into **unjustified inference**.

---

## Governance implications

Properly governed systems must:

- explicitly document proxy use and limits
- prohibit proxy-based inference of sensitive traits
- prevent proxy outputs from being treated as evidence
- require decay and re-evaluation of inferred states
- separate behavioural modelling from identity, safety, and enforcement layers
- provide redress pathways for users affected by misinterpretation

Failure to do so is not a technical issue.
It is a governance failure.

---

## Key takeaway

> **Behavioural proxies are not truths.  
They are guesses made under constraint.**

When systems forget this, they stop modelling behaviour
and start **writing stories about people**.

This node documents how that happens —  
and why it is structurally unsafe.

*Behavioural Proxy Misinterpretation* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**, documenting how indirect behavioural signals are routinely over-interpreted as intent, state, or character — and how this practice creates structural risk for misattribution, harm, and governance failure across large-scale systems.

This node distinguishes between **heuristic modelling** and **unjustified inference**, and situates proxy misinterpretation as a systemic issue rather than an edge-case error.
