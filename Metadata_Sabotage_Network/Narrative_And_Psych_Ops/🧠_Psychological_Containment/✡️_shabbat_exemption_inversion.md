## 📑 Forensic Notes  
- COGAT halts humanitarian approvals on Shabbat.  
- IDF continues combat operations during same period.  
- In Jewish law, pikuach nefesh (saving life) overrides Shabbat.  
- Selective suspension undermines claimed religious justification.  

## 🧠 Psychological Containment  
Shabbat becomes a bureaucratic pause for aid, but not for bombs.  
Religion is instrumentalised as cover for delay.  

## 🎛 Survivor Voice Fidelity  
“If this were about faith, it would look the other way round. They rest the pen that clears food, but not the hand that drops fire.”
