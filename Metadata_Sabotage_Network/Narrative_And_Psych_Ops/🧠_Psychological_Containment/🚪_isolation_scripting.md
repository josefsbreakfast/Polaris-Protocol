*Manufactured solitude — cutting off networks, withholding contact, and staging abandonment.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

**Isolation scripting** refers to coordinated or patterned acts that **manufacture solitude**.  
Rather than overt exile, containment is achieved through withheld communication, suspended access, or subtle shifts that make a survivor appear unwanted or forgotten.  
These acts are “scripted” — recurring across contexts and platforms — producing the illusion that abandonment is organic rather than orchestrated.

## 🛰️ Mechanisms  

- **Contact throttling:** messages or calls delayed, rerouted, or dropped.  
- **Network fragmentation:** key allies go silent simultaneously, often citing fatigue or irrelevance.  
- **Narrative inversion:** survivor framed as withdrawing or unstable when they react to isolation.  
- **Visibility gating:** posts, emails, or alerts quietly deprioritised to simulate disinterest.  

---

## 🌩️ Impacts  

- **Perceived desertion:** survivor internalises blame for social collapse.  
- **Self-censorship:** fear of “bothering” others replaces genuine communication.  
- **Psychological implosion:** the echo chamber of silence breeds despair and hypervigilance.  
- **Systemic utility:** reduced witness networks and easier discrediting of later testimony.

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Impulse  

- **Name the script:** isolation is a tactic, not a reflection of worth.  
- **Re-anchor elsewhere:** reconnect even in minimal, low-risk ways (letters, local presence, analog spaces).  
- **Record silence:** log timing of dropped messages and lapsed contact — patterns are data.  
- **Resist self-blame:** absence of response is not proof of irrelevance.

## 🌌 Constellations  

🚪 🧠 🕯️ 🫂  
- **Franz Kafka — *The Castle***: endless approach toward unreachable community.  
- **Jean-Paul Sartre — *No Exit***: containment as interdependence weaponised.  
- **Toni Morrison — *Beloved***: isolation of the haunted as social control.  
- **Foucault — *Discipline and Punish***: surveillance internalised as self-isolation.

*🚪 Isolation Scripting* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how isolation is scripted and staged to create artificial solitude — a tactic that turns silence into containment.
