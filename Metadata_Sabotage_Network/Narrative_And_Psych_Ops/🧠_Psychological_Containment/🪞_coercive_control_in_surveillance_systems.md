# 🪞 Coercive Control in Surveillance Systems  
**First created:** 2025-11-22 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-01  
*Digital coercion mirrors physical captivity — with different tools, same logic.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Surveillance systems do not simply observe —  
they **shape behaviour**,  
create dependency,  
generate fear,  
and trap people in loops identical to coercive control in physical captivity.

This node maps the parallels.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Digital coercion replicates captivity logic.  
- Metadata becomes environment control.  
- Flags act as invisible threats.  
- Victims internalise system fear.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Captivity Logic in Digital Systems  
Physical coercion uses:
- threat of violence,  
- environmental control,  
- narrative manipulation,  
- enforced dependency.

Digital coercion uses:
- opaque flags,  
- unpredictable escalation,  
- data-driven humiliation,  
- constant visibility,  
- unpredictable case “revivals.”

Same logic. Different mechanisms.

### 2. How Systems Train Behaviour  
Survivors learn:
- not to escalate,  
- not to challenge errors,  
- not to ask questions,  
- not to attract attention.

The system becomes the abuser’s proxy.

### 3. Signs of Digital Coercive Control  
- unexplained escalations,  
- being “forgotten” then suddenly revived,  
- conflicting professional narratives,  
- refusal to correct errors,  
- fear of institutional retaliation,  
- loss of autonomy in civic life.

### 4. Why This Must Be Named  
Because digital coercion is still coercion —  
and until it is recognised as such, institutions will treat it as “admin confusion” rather than engineered harm.
