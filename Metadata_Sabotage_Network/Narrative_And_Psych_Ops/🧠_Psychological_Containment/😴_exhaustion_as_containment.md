# 😴 Exhaustion as Containment

*Cycles of disruption — sleep, attention, and cognitive load — that drain capacity to resist.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

**Exhaustion** is one of the most efficient containment mechanisms.  
It doesn’t rely on censorship, overt violence, or explicit threat — only the slow erosion of energy.  
Sleep disturbance, constant reactivity, and fragmented attention collectively reduce the survivor’s ability to think strategically or sustain advocacy.  
Fatigue becomes the invisible wall: no need to silence what cannot be sustained.  

---

## 🛰️ Mechanisms  

- **Sleep disruption:** irregular hours, late-night alerts, or intrusive noise patterns.  
- **Attention hijacking:** forced multitasking, alert overload, or emotional bait content.  
- **Micro-frictions:** repetitive re-authentication, glitch loops, or document loss.  
- **Compassion drain:** crises arrive faster than capacity to care for them.  

Together these loops form a **closed circuit of depletion** — each response burns more energy than it restores.  

---

## 🌩️ Systemic Implications  

- **Containment through fatigue:** tired people can’t escalate.  
- **Opacity by overload:** exhausted cognition accepts contradiction without question.  
- **Compliance through collapse:** surrender masquerades as recovery.  

---

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor Impulse  

- **Prioritise rest as resistance:** recovery is not retreat — it’s repair.  
- **Create rhythm autonomy:** decide when to engage, not when summoned.  
- **Document fatigue triggers:** they often align with suppression events.  
- **Rebuild in micro-rests:** quiet seconds can still be reclamation.

- **Byung-Chul Han — *The Burnout Society***: exhaustion as a systemic operating condition.  
- **Lauren Berlant — *Cruel Optimism***: survival tethered to what depletes.

*😴 Exhaustion as Containment* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how fatigue and depletion function as control mechanisms — draining resistance until silence looks like rest.
