*Creating voids where care should exist; turning solidarity into absence so survivors self-blame*  

---

## ✨ Overview  

A **weaponised empathy gap** occurs when expected care, solidarity, or recognition is **deliberately withheld**.  
It’s not open hostility — it’s the *absence* of warmth, the silence that lands like judgment.  
By removing empathy at strategic points, systems induce survivors to doubt their own worth and internalise blame for others’ indifference.  

Empathy gaps transform moral expectation into containment.  
They create the illusion that *no one cares* — when in fact, someone chose not to.

## 🛰️ Mechanism  

- **Strategic omission:** kindness withheld precisely when validation would restore agency.  
- **Moral misdirection:** observers persuaded that neutrality is virtue, not complicity.  
- **Psychological recoil:** survivor overcompensates — explaining, apologising, shrinking — to fill the void.  
- **Systemic insulation:** institutions train empathy out of responders, replacing care with “objectivity.”  

---

## 💫 Systemic Implications  

- **Ethical exhaustion:** those who still feel deeply become framed as “too emotional.”  
- **Solidarity erosion:** peers learn that compassion is risky and distance safer.  
- **Containment by absence:** empathy withdrawal functions as a silent sanction.

## 🌱 Survivor Impulse  

- **Name the absence:** silence is not neutrality — it’s participation.  
- **Keep records of neglect:** the failure to respond *is* data.  
- **Find reciprocal circuits:** seek those who still feel and act.  
- **Remember:** withheld care reflects their containment, not your unworthiness.

*💔 Weaponised Empathy Gaps* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how empathy and care are selectively withheld to manufacture silence and self-blame — a key tactic of psychological containment.
