## 📑 Forensic Notes  
- Delay regimes = systemic obstruction, not inefficiency.  
- Repeated in aid, medical, administrative processing.  
- Recognised in international law: denial of essentials by delay can breach IHL and human rights standards.  

## 🧠 Psychological Containment  
Waiting becomes enforced compliance.  
Delay is framed as neutral, but it bleeds capacity.  

## 🎛 Survivor Voice Fidelity  
“Every missing hour is a decision to bleed us dry. They make us wait until hope itself is exhausted.”
