# 🧾 Credibility Logs — The Forensics of Restoration  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-28  
*Timestamping, tracking, and truth recovery within contested narratives.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
In the aftermath of discrediting campaigns, credibility must be **rebuilt, not assumed**.  
In a networked world where quotes are decontextualised and recordings remixed, the act of maintaining a timestamp becomes a form of testimony.  

*Credibility Logs* provide a **forensic chain of truth**—a way for survivors, journalists, and witnesses to document their own words, edits, and responses in tamper-evident form.  
This is **counter-sabotage recordkeeping**: restoring the timeline that smear tactics seek to erase.

The framework combines digital provenance tools with ethical transparency.  
It does not depend on institutional validation but on **documented authorship sovereignty**.

---

## 👁️‍🗨️ Timestamping Speech  
Each statement—written, spoken, or transcribed—is registered with a hash and UTC timestamp.  
- `git commit` or `GPG signed log` creates immutable authorship records.  
- `openssl dgst -sha256` generates verifiable checksums.  
- `blockchain timestamping` (e.g., OpenTimestamps) can extend public proof.  

These timestamps form **temporal anchors**, enabling the reconstruction of what was said, when, and in what order—countering fabricated or reordered narratives.

---

## 💫 Integrity Archives  
Credibility logs integrate with the *Signal Integrity Protocols* chain to ensure that **text, audio, and metadata share a single verification spine**.  
Each edit or correction is preserved as a diff, not a deletion.  
Every version remains visible through clear commit metadata.  

When someone claims “this person changed their story,” the log provides the full record—versioned, dated, and cryptographically validated.

---

## 🧿 Transparent Edits and Witness Chains  
Transparency does not mean exposure; it means **traceable transformation**.  
Witness chains document how a statement passes through multiple hands—editors, transcribers, moderators—so that editorial process cannot be used as evidence of deceit.  

Suggested manifest snippet:  
```yaml
credibility_entry_id: C-2025-0041
source_record: testimony_2025-10-20.txt
hash_sha256: "<checksum>"
created_at: "2025-10-21T16:15:00Z"
edited_by: ["Journalist B", "Editor X"]
edit_summary: "Condensed for broadcast; meaning unchanged."
verification: "Survivor-approved transcript"
signature: "<PGP signature>"
related_audio: "testimony.wav"
```

Witness chains reveal continuity, not compromise—showing that *truth can have multiple handlers without losing integrity.*

---

## 🧄 Credibility as Collective Maintenance  
Restoration is rarely individual work.  
Survivors, allies, archivists, and readers all contribute to **credibility repair** through citation, corroboration, and version mirroring.  
Public trust becomes an *infrastructure project*, not a popularity contest.  

Collective logging practices—mirrored repositories, shared timestamp servers, parallel archives—turn credibility into a distributed system, not a fragile claim.

## 🪄 Verification Toolkit — Temporal Forensics  

### ⏱ Hashing & Commit Proofs  
- `git log --show-signature` — Validate signed edits.  
- `gpg --verify` — Confirm authorship of corrections.  
- `openssl dgst -sha256 <file>` — Generate matching hash for cross-node comparison.

### 🪶 Log Comparison  
- `diff --color=auto version1.txt version2.txt` — Transparent text changes.  
- `git diff` — Version-by-version edit trail.  
- `jq` — Verify JSON manifest integrity.

### 🗂 Timestamp Anchoring  
- `ots stamp testimony.wav` — Generate blockchain-based timestamp proof.  
- `python3 -m hashlib.sha256 testimony.wav` — Quick local verification.  

These tools make *temporal integrity* verifiable across platforms.

## 🧾 Credibility Manifest Template (YAML)  
This schema parallels the Signal Integrity manifest, but focuses on textual and editorial transparency.

```yaml

recorded_at: "2025-10-21T16:15:00Z"
verified_by: ["Survivor", "Editor X"]
modifications: 
  - "transcribed"
  - "compressed for clarity"
  - "fact-checked against audio"
