# 🔊 Signal Integrity Protocols — Protecting the Sound of the Voice  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-21  
*Metadata sabotage counter-techniques for verifying and reclaiming authentic voice testimony.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
In a world where generative AI can mimic speech with frightening precision, **authentic voice becomes both target and proof**.  
AI engines are routinely trained on scraped material—lectures, interviews, even survivor testimonies—without consent.  
Authors, actors, and journalists are now pursuing class-action suits precisely because **their voices were absorbed into training data** without permission.  

Within this environment, a person’s recorded voice can be **weaponised**: cloned to spread disinformation, spliced into fabricated “confessions,” or stripped of metadata to erase context.  
The **Signal Integrity Protocols** exist to defend against that.  
They establish a technical and moral perimeter around the voice, enabling survivors and witnesses to trace, verify, and reclaim what is rightfully theirs.

---

## 1️⃣ Acoustic Trace Encoding  
Hidden watermark layers—phase-shift IDs, timestamp seeds, or inaudible carrier tones—let genuine recordings assert their origin.  
When a clip resurfaces stripped of context, these **trace anchors** reveal lineage and detect re-encoding.  
Each survivor or archive maintains private keys so the watermark remains verifiable but not forgeable.

---

## 2️⃣ Voiceprint Hash Libraries  
Create **hash registries** of verified voiceprints using non-reversible spectral hashes (formant and pitch-contour signatures).  
These act as cryptographic fingerprints without storing the full recording.  
If a new “statement” appears online, its hash can be compared against the registry to confirm or refute authenticity—exposing synthetic clones masquerading as testimony.

---

## 3️⃣ Sabotage Pattern Detection  
Voice sabotage often hides in metadata seams:  
- Timestamp drift or timezone mismatch.  
- Inconsistent bit-depth or codec headers.  
- Spectral smoothing artefacts from AI regeneration.  
- Unnatural silence distribution between phrases.  
Mapping these anomalies across reposted material reveals coordinated remix campaigns and points of algorithmic injection.

---

## 4️⃣ Integrity Chains  
Every authentic clip should carry a **forensic integrity chain**:  
1. Capture → hash → timestamp.  
2. Encrypt → store → verify.  
3. Publish with companion manifest (JSON / YAML).  
Any later deviation exposes a break in custody.  
Integrating these logs into the wider Polaris metadata signature schema allows cross-analysis with image, caption, and document sabotage trails.

---

## 5️⃣ Survivor-Authored Verification  
Alongside the audio, survivors issue signed manifests asserting authorship and consent scope.  
Example keys appear in the Verification Schema below.  
This ensures that even if fragments circulate independently, the **sovereign voice remains cryptographically traceable** to its originator.  

---

## 6️⃣ Counter-Discrediting Applications  
Signal integrity analysis can rebut smear campaigns by providing:  
- Spectral-forensic evidence of manipulation.  
- Metadata lineage showing lawful authorship.  
- Cross-hash matches linking hostile edits back to specific dissemination chains.  
Used correctly, it re-anchors trust in survivor testimony and exposes synthetic amplification tactics.

---

## 🧰 Verification Toolkit — Open-Source Counter-Forensics  
To make these defences reproducible, the following tools and methods are recommended for community or journalist use:

### 🪶 Capture and Hashing  
- `ffmpeg` — Extract precise metadata and generate SHA-256 hashes.  
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i testimony.wav -f md5 -
  shasum -a 256 testimony.wav
  ```
- `sox` — Inspect spectral signatures and detect unnatural transitions.  
  ```bash
  sox testimony.wav -n stat
  ```

### 🔐 Watermark & Trace  
- `Audiowmark` — Open-source acoustic watermarking utility.  
- `Praat` — Formant analysis for building reproducible voiceprint profiles.  
- `Audacity Spectrogram View` — Quick detection of synthetic harmonics or smoothed noise floors.

### 🧩 Verification & Comparison  
- `Sonic Visualiser` — Layer and align waveforms for cross-matching.  
- `pyAudioAnalysis` or `OpenSMILE` — Derive spectral feature vectors; hash them for later verification.  
- `ExifTool` — Export and diff embedded metadata across reposted files.

### 🗂 Logging and Chain Management  
- `git lfs track "*.wav"` — Maintain versioned custody of large files.  
- `openssl dgst -sha256 <file>` — Produce verifiable hash logs.  
- Store hashes in signed CSV or YAML manifests, synchronised across mirrors.

## 🧾 Verification Schema (YAML Manifest Template)  
Each verified audio testimony should ship with a manifest file named identically to the audio (e.g., `voice001.yaml`).  

```yaml
version: 1.0
voice_id: V-2025-0013
file_name: testimony.wav
hash_sha256: "<insert checksum>"
recorded_at: "2025-10-21T15:02:00Z"
device_id: "ZoomH4n-Pro"
location_context: "verified private setting"
consent_scope: "public excerpt only"
authored_by: "Witness A"
statement: "This is my unaltered voice testimony."
signature: "<PGP or digital signature>"
related_nodes:
  - "../../🧬_clone_drift_deepfakes_audio_manipulation_and_voice_theft.md"
  - "../../🧿_targeting_logic_metadata_signatures.md"
notes: >
  Embedded watermark verified; spectral hash matches reference V-2025-0013.
  Any deviation indicates possible tampering or synthetic regeneration.
```

This schema aligns with the **Metadata Sabotage Network evidence format**, ensuring compatibility with future signature-comparison pipelines and FOIA disclosure packages.
