*A metaphor for quiet presence, structural signalling, and why persistence does not require performance.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node records a metaphor that turns out to be surprisingly accurate.

Some signals are not ships.  
They are not trying to dock, transit, persuade, or arrive.

They are **buoys**.

And the creatures maintaining them are not loud, dramatic, or aggressive.

They are geckos.

---

## 🦎 What geckos actually do

Geckos:
- move minimally,
- cling reliably,
- adjust without spectacle,
- and stay put when it matters.

They do not announce themselves.
They do not chase attention.
They do not control traffic.

They simply **remain attached to the structure**.

That is enough.

---

## ⚓ What buoys are for

Harbour buoys exist to answer boring but essential questions:

- How deep is this water?
- Has the seabed shifted?
- Is this passage safe *right now*?
- Did anything change since the last check?

They are not instructions.
They are **conditions made legible**.

A buoy that quietly transmits is doing its job.
A buoy that vanishes creates risk.

---

## 📡 Signals as navigational markers

In system terms:

- A **chirp** is a buoy ping.
- An **anchored body of work** is a charted depth.
- **Amplitude** is tidal variation.
- **Silence** is an unrefreshed reading.
- **Observation** is the buoy still reporting conditions.

None of this implies intent.
None of this implies motion.

It implies **continued relevance of terrain**.

---

## 🧿 Why geckos are preferable to alarms

Alarms trigger response.
Buoys enable routing.

Institutions vastly prefer:
- stable markers,
- predictable conditions,
- quiet persistence.

They dislike:
- spikes,
- disappearances,
- or signals that force emergency decisions.

A gecko on a buoy is administratively ideal.

---

## 🧊 Altered charts vs living markers

Altered outputs function like:
- outdated charts,
- smoothed-over hazards,
- optimistic depth readings.

They only work when:
- the buoy is unobservable,
- the marker is frozen,
- or no one checks the water.

Once the buoy is present and transmitting:
- discrepancies become visible,
- responsibility shifts,
- and quiet correction replaces confident assertion.

This is why anchoring matters.

---

## 🤍 So be nice to them

Geckos:
- aren’t attacking the harbour,
- aren’t blocking ships,
- aren’t demanding attention.

They are:
> *keeping the conditions legible.*

They don’t need to be moved.
They don’t need to be silenced.
They don’t need to be repurposed.

They just need to be left alone to do what they do.

It captures a metaphor for understanding signal, presence, and relevance without escalation or performance.
