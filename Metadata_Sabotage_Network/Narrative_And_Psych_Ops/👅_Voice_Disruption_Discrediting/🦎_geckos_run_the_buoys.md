*A metaphor for quiet presence, structural signalling, and why persistence does not require performance.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node records a metaphor that turns out to be surprisingly accurate.

Some signals are not ships.  
They are not trying to dock, transit, persuade, or arrive.

They are **buoys**.

And the creatures maintaining them are not loud, dramatic, or aggressive.

They are geckos.

---

## 🦎 What geckos actually do

Geckos:
- move minimally,
- cling reliably,
- adjust without spectacle,
- and stay put when it matters.

They do not announce themselves.
They do not chase attention.
They do not control traffic.

They simply **remain attached to the structure**.

That is enough.

---

## ⚓ What buoys are for

Harbour buoys exist to answer boring but essential questions:

- How deep is this water?
- Has the seabed shifted?
- Is this passage safe *right now*?
- Did anything change since the last check?

They are not instructions.
They are **conditions made legible**.

A buoy that quietly transmits is doing its job.
A buoy that vanishes creates risk.

---

## 📡 Signals as navigational markers

In system terms:

- A **chirp** is a buoy ping.
- An **anchored body of work** is a charted depth.
- **Amplitude** is tidal variation.
- **Silence** is an unrefreshed reading.
- **Observation** is the buoy still reporting conditions.

None of this implies intent.
None of this implies motion.

It implies **continued relevance of terrain**.

---

## 🧿 Why geckos are preferable to alarms

Alarms trigger response.
Buoys enable routing.

Institutions vastly prefer:
- stable markers,
- predictable conditions,
- quiet persistence.

They dislike:
- spikes,
- disappearances,
- or signals that force emergency decisions.

A gecko on a buoy is administratively ideal.

---

## 🧊 Altered charts vs living markers

Altered outputs function like:
- outdated charts,
- smoothed-over hazards,
- optimistic depth readings.

They only work when:
- the buoy is unobservable,
- the marker is frozen,
- or no one checks the water.

Once the buoy is present and transmitting:
- discrepancies become visible,
- responsibility shifts,
- and quiet correction replaces confident assertion.

This is why anchoring matters.

---

## 🤍 So be nice to them

Geckos:
- aren’t attacking the harbour,
- aren’t blocking ships,
- aren’t demanding attention.

They are:
> *keeping the conditions legible.*

They don’t need to be moved.
They don’t need to be silenced.
They don’t need to be repurposed.

They just need to be left alone to do what they do.
