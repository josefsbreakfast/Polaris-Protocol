*Authoritarian strongmen as fragile caricatures, undone not by armies but by laughter.*

---

## Summary  
This node catalogues how authoritarian leaders build their legitimacy on theatrical masculinity and stage-managed dignity — and why that makes them exquisitely vulnerable to humour. From Putin’s topless horse rides to Xi’s censorship of Winnie the Pooh, Modi’s costume play to Bukele’s dystopian prison shows, the pattern is universal: power looks strong until it becomes a punchline.  

---

## The Pattern  
1. **Masculinity as theatre:** uniforms, parades, topless photo-ops, choreographed tears.  
2. **Control as costume:** endless speeches, fake referenda, social credit scores, “CEO of the nation.”  
3. **Fragility exposed by humour:** the smallest parody punctures the aura of inevitability.  
4. **Universal weakness:** East or West, left or right, authoritarians can jail dissidents — but they cannot jail laughter.

## Examples of Paper-Thin Tigers  

- **Putin (Russia):** Bootleg Karate Kid judo master; Tsar of Bentleys with babushkas begging for toilet money.  
- **Xi Jinping (China):** The man who banned Winnie the Pooh but not poverty.  
- **Narendra Modi (India):** More costume changes than policies; the world’s most photographed strongman.  
- **Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (Egypt):** Pharaoh cosplay with fewer pyramids.  
- **Mohammed bin Salman (Saudi Arabia):** Can buy football clubs, can’t buy a sense of humour.  
- **Nayib Bukele (El Salvador):** Tech-bro dictator; “prison influencer” running the world’s largest carceral cosplay.

## Why Humour Works Here  
- **Fear corrodes slowly; laughter corrodes instantly.**  
- **Authoritarian theatre depends on dignity; parody makes it absurd.**  
- **People bond over jokes faster than propaganda can divide them.**  
- **Mockery is sticky:** once the image is laughable, it cannot be reassembled.  
- **You can have as many death camps as you want — but you are not a strong man if you cannot take a joke.**

## Practical Guidance for Satirists  
- Target the **performance**, not the victims.  
- Use **archetypes** (bootleg judo, Pharaoh cosplay, tech-bro dictator) to make the ridicule memorable.  
- Highlight **props**: swords, horses, uniforms, medals → all can be shown as camp theatre.  
- Reframe **aura as absurdity**: what is sold as awe can be recoded as pantomime.

## Analytical Note  
These leaders are not “tigers” at all but paper-thin projections: a mixture of stagecraft, repression, and fragile vanity. When the performance collapses under ridicule, the system behind it is revealed as brittle.
