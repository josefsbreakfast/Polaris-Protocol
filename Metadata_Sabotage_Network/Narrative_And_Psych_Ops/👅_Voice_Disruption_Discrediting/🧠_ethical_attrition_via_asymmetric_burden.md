# 🧠 Ethical Attrition via Asymmetric Burden  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-13  
*How ethical, competent officers leave voluntarily under sustained pressure — and why this quietly hollows institutions.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Authoritarian capture does not rely solely on purges, firings, or overt repression.

One of its most effective mechanisms is **ethical attrition**:  
the slow, voluntary exit of officers who can no longer perform their roles without incurring unacceptable moral injury.

This node documents how asymmetric burden concentrates ethical labour onto a shrinking minority — until departure becomes the only survivable option.

## 🧠 Why “Good” Officers Leave  

Officers most likely to exit early are often those who:
- take legal and ethical standards seriously,
- engage in de-escalation and community mediation,
- notice systemic patterns and inconsistencies,
- feel responsible for the downstream consequences of enforcement.

As institutions come under stress, these officers are not removed directly.
They are **relied upon excessively**.

What drives departure is not fragility —  
it is clarity.

---

## ⚖️ Moral Injury as a Load-Bearing Failure  

Moral injury arises when individuals are:
- required to act against their ethical framework,
- repeatedly placed in no-win situations,
- or forced to absorb harm created elsewhere in the system.

Under asymmetric pressure:
- complex cases land on the same people,
- ethical review becomes informal and unpaid,
- harm mitigation is treated as discretionary labour.

Ethics become infrastructure — and infrastructure breaks when overloaded.

---

## 🔥 Load Concentration Dynamics  

As authoritarian-aligned pressures increase:
- some officers disengage,
- others avoid risk,
- and a smaller group compensates.

This creates a feedback loop:
1. Ethical officers take on more work  
2. Burnout accelerates  
3. Attrition increases  
4. Remaining officers carry even more load  

The system adapts by **thinning cognition**, not by correcting conditions.

## 🧿 Quiet Exits vs Visible Purges  

Unlike overt authoritarian purges, ethical attrition:
- produces no scandal,
- triggers no inquiry,
- and is framed as “natural turnover”.

Common exit pathways include:
- early retirement,
- lateral career moves,
- health-related leave,
- resignation for “personal reasons”.

From the outside, nothing appears wrong.
From the inside, institutional memory is draining away.

---

## 🧠 Ethical Hollowing of Institutions  

Over time, this produces:
- loss of complexity and judgment,
- over-reliance on force and procedure,
- diminished capacity for reform,
- and increased tolerance for harm under stress.

The institution becomes:
- less adaptable,
- less reflective,
- and more compliant with coercive logics.

This is not radicalisation.
It is **attrition of restraint**.

---

## 🚨 Diagnostic Signals  

Indicators of ethical attrition include:
- disproportionate exit of community-facing officers,
- burnout clustering among ethical performers,
- departure of whistleblowers and reform advocates,
- leadership treating exits as unavoidable rather than informative.

Attrition patterns are data.
Ignoring them is a choice.

*Ethical Attrition via Asymmetric Burden* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how authoritarian pressure hollow institutions not through expulsion, but through the quiet loss of those most capable of ethical resistance.
