## 1. Principle  
Harassment often does not target a survivor in isolation.  
Instead, it pairs or “twins” survivors, projecting one against the other.  
The result: each holds evidence of how harassment was constructed.  

---

## 2. Projection Layer  
- **Romantic/astrology tropes** used to feminise & discredit.  
- Survivor framed as irrational, delicate, hysterical.  
- Projection reveals more about the harasser than the survivor.  

---

## 3. Obstruction Layer  
- Harassment includes messages like *“don’t contact, stay silent”*.  
- This functions as **witness obstruction**.  
- Gendered framing (“hysterical woman”) makes disclosure harder.  

---

## 4. Forensic Layer  
- By comparing mirrored harassment streams, survivors can reconstruct:  
  - Who seeded which fragments.  
  - When spoofing or fraud happened.  
  - Which parties had access/knowledge.  
- Alignment = map of the harassment funnel.  

---

## 5. Behavioural Fingerprints  
- Harassment style reveals personality traits (tone, style, cultural frames).  
- Those traits make it possible to exclude wrongly-implied figures.  
- Like disinhibited behaviour when drunk, harassment exposes baseline traits.  

---

## 6. Closing Note  
Survivors are not just victims.  
They are **co-witnesses**: holding mirrored fragments of harassment that, when combined, reveal the full sequence.  
<!-- Stop pushing astrological “advice” at me. This is not romance. It is fraud. And obstruction of disclosure. -->

## 🏮 Footer  
*Witness Pairing and Projection* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It reframes survivor pairing as forensic alignment, not coincidence.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
