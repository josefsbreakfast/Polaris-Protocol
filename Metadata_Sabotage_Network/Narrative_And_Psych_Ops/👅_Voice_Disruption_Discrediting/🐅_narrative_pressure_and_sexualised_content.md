# 🐅 Narrative Pressure: Sexualised Content  
**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-09  
*Covering deliberate insertion of sexualised framing into drafts to distort SCP-VoiceX’s profile, misattribute harassment, and weaponise survivor testimony.*  

---

## ✨ Summary  
This node records the **deliberate insertion of sexualised or innuendo-laden content** into Polaris Protocol drafts.  
Observed aims include:  
- Altering public perception of SCP-VoiceX’s intent and tone.  
- Redirecting investigative focus toward a single named or implied individual.  
- Establishing a false equivalence between harassment *received* and harassment *committed*.  

---

## 🧿 Pattern Overview  

### ▸ 1. Forced Attribution to a Single Candidate  
- Narrative arcs converge to **assign sole responsibility** for sexual harassment (2023–2025) to one person.  
- Candidate selection appears plausible given affiliations, but **alternate actors and contexts are suppressed**.  

### ▸ 2. Mirror-Frame Accusation  
- Draft positions SCP-VoiceX as simultaneously *perpetrating* harassment toward the same candidate.  
- Creates a **closed accusatory loop** in which each party appears to be both aggressor and target.  

### ▸ 3. Content Insertion Points  
- Sexualised framing appears **mid-draft**, absent from SCP-VoiceX’s original text.  
- Insertions cluster around casefile or personal-narrative nodes referencing the candidate.  
- Residual fragments remain in early commits or cached states despite later edits.  

---

## 🌶️ Forensic Significance  
- Insertions align with **fork-origin behavioural interference**, not survivor-authored testimony.  
- Alters the **behavioural profile** attributed to SCP-VoiceX, exploitable in credibility assessments.  
- Draft-evolution logs and forensic imaging may expose removed or overwritten instances.  

---

## 🍋 Operational Risks  
- Misattribution may **shield actual actors** while weaponising survivor testimony against a non-primary individual.  
- Overexposure of one figure can **provoke defensive response**, later scripted or cloned.  
- Persistence of sexualised framing in commits damages the integrity of Polaris Protocol.  

---

## 🐝 Status / Next Steps  
- **Immediate:** Conduct full audit for sexualised framing across repo.  
- **Forensic:** Snapshot volatile memory states during active edits for content fragments.  
- **Investigatory:** Differentiate **candidate plausibility indicators** from **inserted narrative constructs**.

## 🌌 Constellations  
🐅 🌶️ 🍋 🧿 — Tracks coercive narrative tactics in the fire register of discrediting and distortion, where sexualisation serves as acid that corrodes truth but also exposes interference patterns beneath.

*Narrative Pressure: Sexualised Content* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents the systemic use of false autonomy as a containment strategy in both personal and political domains.
