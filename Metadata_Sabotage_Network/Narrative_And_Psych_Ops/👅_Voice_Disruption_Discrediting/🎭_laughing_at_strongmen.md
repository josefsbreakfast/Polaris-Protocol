# 🎭 Laughing at Strongmen  
**First created:** 2025-11-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-09  
*Cabaret, caricature, and the comedic collapse of authoritarian theatre.*

---

## 🪞 Orientation  
This node examines how humour functions as both resistance and containment within authoritarian performance cultures.  
From the balcony posturing of Mussolini to the meme parodies of Trump and Putin, laughter can puncture power — or be reabsorbed by it.  
The goal is to trace when mockery liberates, and when it becomes a mirror that flatters the regime instead.

## 🧩 Key Features  
- **Cabaret lineage:** laughter as coded dissent and social camouflage.  
- **Propaganda mimicry:** when parody reinforces, rather than weakens, the myth.  
- **Feedback theatre:** state imagery becoming indistinguishable from satire.  
- **Ethical charge:** the difference between laughing at the tyrant and laughing with him.

## 🧠 Analysis / Content  
Future expansion will compare:  
- *Mussolini’s balcony films* — the original fascist stagecraft.  
- *Putin’s image management* — masculinity as performance loop.  
- *Trump rallies* — farce mistaken for authenticity.  
- *Kim Jong-un missile spectacles* — self-parody through grandeur.
