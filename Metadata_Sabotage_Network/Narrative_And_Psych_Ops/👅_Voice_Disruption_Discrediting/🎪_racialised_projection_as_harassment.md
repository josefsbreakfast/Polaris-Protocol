*How racist tropes are performed as projection theatre to frame others and expose perpetrator insecurity.*

## 🛰️ Introduction — When Spectacle Turns to Signal  

There is a particular kind of harassment that does not hide in darkness; it performs under bright lights.  
It paints faces, adds laugh tracks, borrows the stage language of comedy or gossip.  
Its cruelty depends on the audience thinking it is funny.  

Racialised projection is one of the oldest versions of that act.  
When the insults begin to look like caricature, when the props resemble costumes from another century, the harassers believe they are disarming seriousness.  
Instead, they tell on themselves.  
The disguise is too theatrical to fool anyone who has seen the script before.  

Harassment here functions as **projection theatre**—an anxious performance that externalises internal fear.  
The performer imagines control by assigning their own shame to someone else’s body.  
The more elaborate the mask, the more visible the wound beneath.

## 📚 Projection Theatre: Roots and Norms  

Projection theatre relies on **racial and sexual tropes** precisely because those images still circulate as shorthand for threat and desire.  
By projecting them onto men of colour, perpetrators reroute attention away from their own behaviour and toward an invented aggressor.  
The survivor becomes untrustworthy, the racialised man becomes dangerous, and the real source of harm exits stage left.  

This inversion is not improvisation; it is choreography.  
Every exaggeration, every echo of the colonial stereotype, repeats an inherited dance of dominance.  
The joke is a prop.  
The laughter is the camouflage.  
The act of performance *is* the evidence.

## 🪡 Historical Context — How the Costume Was Made  

### 💸 From Caricature to Commerce  

Nineteenth-century Europe and America built entire industries on racialised display: minstrel circuits, freak-show exhibitions, “human zoos.”  
The caricatures produced then were more than entertainment; they were instruments of classification.  
A face painted in soot, a grin exaggerated beyond anatomy, a body forced into dance—each became a reassurance that whiteness was composure and Blackness was chaos.  

The logic travelled effortlessly into advertising.  
Golliwogs, jam labels, tobacco tins, cleaning products—all carried miniature performances of subjugation.  
They were sold as domestic icons, something a child might grow up with on the breakfast table.  

*I remember one of those jars on my grandmother’s shelf—Robertson’s, I think.  
When I asked her what the figure was, she said it was “just a cartoon.”  
She wasn’t cruel; she simply didn’t know.  
Neither did I.  
It took me years to understand that the smiling mascot was not harmless, but a residue of a show that once paraded melanin as comedy.  
I share memories like these, not to say "it's not our fault", but to add to openly discussing, as white/passing people, how normalised these cultural imprints are, so we can name them and shed them.*    

That moment of delayed recognition matters.  
It demonstrates how whiteness protects itself through **cultural amnesia**: by insisting the performance is only play.  
The refusal to see the history in the joke is what keeps the joke alive.

### 🎟️ Racialisation as Spectacle — Audience as Instrument  

Racialisation begins not with pigment but with audience.  
The performance requires witnesses — eyes trained to confuse curiosity with entitlement.  
Long before the digital feed, this gaze was rehearsed in the theatre of empire.  

A *Times* report from 26 November 1810 captured the logic clearly when describing Saartjie Baartman’s London exhibition:  

> “...she is dressed in a colour as nearly resembling her skin as possible.  
> The dress is contrived to exhibit the entire frame of her body,  
> and the spectators are even invited to examine the peculiarities of her form.”  

As **Rokeshia Renné Ashley**, assistant professor of communication at Florida International University, later wrote in *How Sarah Baartman’s hips went from a symbol of exploitation to a source of empowerment for Black women* (*The Conversation / FIU News*, 2021):  

> “Often naked in these exhibitions, Baartman was sometimes suspended in a cage on stage while being poked, prodded and groped...  
> Both became symbolic markers of racial difference, and many other women from this part of Africa were trafficked to Europe for white entertainment...  
> Of course, Black women’s bodies vary; there is no monolithic – nor ideal – type.”  

The repetition of tone across two centuries is chilling.  
Where *The Times* rendered objectification as polite curiosity, Ashley renders it as structural violence.  
Juxtaposed together they reveal that spectacle has always depended on the spectator’s comfort — the ability to watch without naming harm.  

*And I am somehow more inclined to take on board what an accomplised woman is saying about how harmful this still is, than assume that a journalist's "this is what this was as a spectator" from 150 years ago, gives any moral remove from the legacy of dehumanisation.*

### 🖤 Reclaiming the Image — From Display to Sovereignty  

Two centuries later, Black women scholars and artists are re-staging the frame.  
What was once a site of violation has, in many hands, become a site of authorship.  
As **Rokeshia Renné Ashley** notes in the same essay, the same curves that once drew colonial audiences now appear in art, music, and scholarship as assertions of agency and ownership.  

> “Black women have taken control of how their bodies are seen, celebrated, and discussed,” Ashley observes, “turning what was used to objectify into a declaration of beauty and survival.”  

This reframing does not erase the original wound; it refracts it.  
To claim visibility on one’s own terms is to rewrite the choreography of the gaze.  
Where Baartman’s audience was invited to *inspect*, contemporary Black women invite the world to *witness* — a subtle but radical shift from curiosity to respect.  

The spectacle remains, but the script has changed hands.

### 🥀 The Freak Show as Prototype  

Consider Saartjie Baartman, exhibited across Europe in the early 1800s as the “Hottentot Venus.”  
Her body was treated as both specimen and spectacle—scientific study in the morning, theatre in the evening.  
The public performance of racialised femininity as curiosity set a durable precedent: the body of colour as proof of otherness, the crowd’s reaction as validation.  
Modern harassment reproduces that economy online—one post, one meme, one viral thrill at a time.  
The freak show continues to find host in the carcerality of care system governance; disabled bodies, particularly where perceived difference is easily visible to the other party, continue to be entrapped by this modern politic of "it's just a joke" style derision.

### 🐁 Digital Continuities and 4chan Irony  

A century later, the internet revives these tropes under the banner of irony.  
Anonymous image boards like 4chan’s /b/ and /pol/ became rehearsal rooms for the same old caricatures, now pixelated and defended as “just jokes.”  

In 2023, journalist **James Ball**—a former 4chan participant—published *The Other Pandemic*.  
He describes joining slur-filled humour that mimicked the insults users had endured themselves.  
It felt, to them, like defiance: reclaiming power through parody.  
But Ball admits a later shock—realising that many participants were not parodying hate; they were practising it.  
The mask had fused to the face.  

That collapse between “joke” and “belief” is the hinge of projection theatre.  
When the laughter becomes conviction, the performance stops being satire and turns into confession.  
Digital blackface, meme warfare, ironic misogyny—each repeats the minstrel loop, hiding fear behind derision.  

---

### 🪩 Irony as Containment Loop  

The “just joking” register is not only camouflage; it is containment logic.  
Irony acts as a holding pattern that keeps violence deniable while letting it circulate.  
This loop is the mirror image of parody’s emancipatory potential:  
where satire deflates power, weaponised irony stabilises it — laughter as leash, not release.

---

### 🪩 Colonial Mimicry as Choreography  

If minstrel shows were the script, colonialism was the dance school.  
The gestures of dominance—mockery, exaggeration, parody of “the other”—became social choreography, learned young and performed without rehearsal.  
Even when the performer is white, he is *mimicking* what it means to be a coloniser.  
He enacts power through belittlement because that is the only grammar of emotion patriarchy has left him.  

*It’s striking, looking back, how often I’ve watched white men imitate the emotional postures of colonial authority, as though they were birthright reflexes; how easily cruelty masquerades as confidence when the culture has taught you that command is the only safe form of feeling.*  

This is why the projection always looks so rehearsed: it is.  
Racism functions as choreography, passed from generation to generation like a folk dance—each step justified as “tradition,” each flourish disguising incapacity for vulnerability.  

And while white men are the least scarred by that dance, they are not unscarred.  
To perform dominance as self-definition is also to lose access to tenderness, to curiosity, to any self not built on comparison.  
The performance harms its actors even as it targets its audience.  

---

### 🎭 The Clown in the Mirror  

*The first time I saw a clip of Puddles Pity Party on America’s Got Talent, I remember the sudden surreal experience of a vaudeville clown singing with the voice of an angel.  
That same dissonance, although with the opposite emotional undertone, is what I feel watching men attempt digital blackface.  
They believe they are performing dominance; what we see is pathos.*  

The modern racist meme has the same awkward majesty: a costume borrowed from another century, performed without awareness of its absurdity.  
The audience may laugh, but the forensic observer hears the wobble in the voice, the quiver of fear.  
It is as obvious—and as tragic—as a clown who doesn’t realise the song he’s chosen exposes him.

## 🌀 3. Projection Dynamics — When Shame Learns to Dance  

Projection theatre runs on choreography.  
Every gesture, every insult, every cruel flourish follows steps learned long before the scene begins.  
It is *colonial mimicry* made emotional: the performance of power by those who have inherited its costume but not its confidence.  
Even when the performer is a white man, he is imitating a coloniser’s script—using domination to translate feelings he has never been allowed to name.  
The show is part defence, part despair.

### 🫦 The Desire That Cannot Speak  

Patriarchy trains men to treat desire and vulnerability as contagions to be contained.  
What cannot be expressed safely must be redirected.  
So when a white or white-coded man discovers that a racialised man shares some private trait—sexual preference, softness, curiosity—he often turns the discovery into attack.  
He does not see his reflection; he sees an opportunity to expel it.

The cruelty is so precise because the recognition is so close.  
It is easier to humiliate what resembles you than to admit resemblance.

*I’ve watched this play out more than once: a white man learning a small, human fact about another man—perhaps something as ordinary as a fondness for silk or the thrill of wearing stockings—and suddenly the air turns acidic. The insults come fast, theatrical, obsessive. It’s as if he’s punishing the mirror for showing him softness he can’t permit himself.*  

The choreography is ancient: repress, project, punish, repeat.  
Each move keeps emotion at a distance while proving, to the performer, that he still controls the room.

### 🐐 Emotional Displacement as Social Sanction  

Western masculinity offers very few approved ways for white men to process shame.  
Anger is allowed; contempt is applauded; tenderness is suspect.  
Racism becomes a kind of stagecraft that legitimises fury.  
It provides an object for the misdirected feeling, a way to strike without confessing need.

When this energy is channelled through institutions—complaints systems, HR reports, disciplinary hearings—it gains a bureaucratic mask.  
What looks like procedural zeal can, at times, be the administrative version of a tantrum.  
The grievance feels righteous because it *is* real emotion, just aimed the wrong way.

There is no need for investigators or managers to psychoanalyse every outburst.  
But an awareness that some professional vendettas are *emotional translations*—the paperwork form of unacknowledged envy or fear—could prevent both scapegoating and escalation.

### 🩸 The Cost to Everyone  

These projections harm most the people already marginalised: Black men, women of colour, queer and trans survivors.  
But they also impoverish the men who launch them.  
By learning only the choreography of domination, they lose fluency in every other emotional language.  
The rage keeps them from curiosity; the ridicule from intimacy.  
To unlearn the dance would not only protect others; it might make them human again.

## 🎼 4. Case Application — Projection in Practice  

Online harassment leaves choreography marks.  
The pattern is recognisable: someone releases a fragment of truth, and almost instantly a chorus of mimicry begins.  
Sock-puppet accounts appear, repeating the survivor’s own words in warped registers—sexualised, racialised, absurd.  
The intention is double: to humiliate the survivor and to bait the racialised man who appears in the story into reaction.  
A false symmetry is created: both now seem volatile, both untrustworthy.  

When a white or white-coded man leads this chorus, the rhythm often betrays the inner motive.  
He rehearses every insult with theatrical precision, as if trying to prove to himself that he is unmoved by what secretly fascinates him.  
The cruelty becomes ornate.  
The more excessive the gesture, the clearer its origin in repression.  

The digital record shows this almost musically.  
Timestamps reveal surges of activity late at night, when inhibition weakens.  
Language drifts from ironic to visceral, from collective chant to personal fixation.  
Each phase of the harassment corresponds to a pulse of unprocessed emotion.  

*I’ve scrolled through those threads at two in the morning and felt the rhythm of it—how the posts speed up when the hatred starts to sound like excitement, how the group performs disgust but their syntax leaks desire.*  

This is why ridicule should never be mistaken for spontaneity.  
It is ritual.  
It follows steps so familiar they could be notated like dance.

## 🧬 5. Forensic Point — Reading the Residue  

From a forensic standpoint, projection theatre produces its own evidence.  
The mismatch between tone and claim, between volume and substance, is diagnostic.  
Wherever harassment leans on stereotypes that the target has never embodied, we are seeing *external scripting*.  

Analysts can trace these insertions across platforms: recycled phrasing, identical punctuation errors, meme reuse.  
The repetition is not only linguistic; it is emotional.  
Each echo carries the same heartbeat of envy and fear.  
When aligned chronologically, these patterns look less like argument and more like choreography notation—proof that the abuse is staged.  

For investigators, recognising projection dynamics does not mean excusing behaviour.  
It clarifies motive and structure.  
It also shifts attention from the apparent chaos of trolling to the **method** behind it: learned performance, colonial mimicry, patriarchal displacement.  

The spectacle itself becomes admissible evidence.  
Every flourish meant to distract is, in truth, a fingerprint.

## ✨ 6. Closing Note — Unlearning the Dance  

To end the performance, the actors must learn new movement.  
Society cannot keep teaching white and white-coded men that the only acceptable motion of emotion is outward aggression.  
If masculinity continues to define expression as domination, projection will remain the default choreography.  

Teaching emotional literacy is not a plea for indulgence; it is a strategy for prevention.  
It allows accountability without annihilation.  
It lets men own desire without weaponising it.  
And it releases everyone else from being the stage on which those unresolved feelings are played out.  

Racialised projection is not only an attack on others; it is the slow self-erasure of the performer.  
Each time he re-enacts the coloniser, he becomes a little less able to speak as himself.  
The cruelty that harms the many also hollows the few who depend on it for identity.  

The way out of the theatre is not applause; it is silence, reflection, and the first awkward steps of a different dance.
