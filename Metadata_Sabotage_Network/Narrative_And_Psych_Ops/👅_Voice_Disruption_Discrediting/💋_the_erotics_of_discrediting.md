*How desire is weaponised to undermine authority.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores the sexualisation of credibility — when attention is redirected from intellect to body, and visibility becomes a vulnerability.  
Traces how gendered smear tactics rely on colonial and racialised fetish logics to destabilise the speaker’s authority.  
Positions eroticisation as a *containment strategy*: a method of rendering truth-tellers hypervisible yet unbelievable.

## 1. 💋 Desire as Distraction  
> **Scaffold prompt:**  
> Describe how sexualisation functions as an *attention hijack mechanism*.  
> - Who benefits when a survivor’s or whistleblower’s testimony becomes “about” their body or desirability?  
> - Connect to PR or intelligence logics: redirection from content to performance.  
> - Anchor one media or institutional example (e.g., coverage of women whistleblowers, “honey trap” framing, etc.).  
> - Optional cross-link: [🧠 Psych-Ops of Tone — The Science of Disbelief](./🧠_psychops_of_tone_the_science_of_disbelief.md).

## 2. 💄 The Spectacle of Vulnerability  
> **Scaffold prompt:**  
> Examine how vulnerability is aestheticised — the eroticisation of pain, tears, or “bravery.”  
> - How do institutions or media profit from packaging suffering as spectacle?  
> - Map where empathy becomes voyeurism.  
> - Consider performative allyship or “survivor influencer” dynamics.  
> - Optional cross-link: [🪞 Interface of Pity](../../Politics_Memory_Work/🪞_interface_of_pity.md) if relevant.

## 3. 🩸 Gendered and Racialised Fetishism  
> **Scaffold prompt:**  
> Trace how colonial and racial fetish logics persist in credibility narratives.  
> - Which bodies are framed as “naturally emotional,” “seductive,” or “untrustworthy”?  
> - Draw parallels between historic ethnographic gaze and modern media or algorithmic gaze.  
> - Highlight how intersectional identity compounds discrediting.  
> - Optional cross-link: [🐝 Body Politic](../../../Big_Picture_Protocols/🫀_Our_Hearts_Our_Minds/🐝_Body_Politic/README.md).

## 4. 🧿 Counter-Gaze and Refusal  
> **Scaffold prompt:**  
> Offer counter-moves — ways to break or subvert the eroticised frame.  
> - How can survivors reclaim visibility without feeding the spectacle?  
> - Introduce “refusal as authorship” — the strategic withdrawal or redirection of gaze.  
> - End with one example of aesthetic or activist reclamation.  
> - Optional cross-link: [🈴 Allies & Ethics](../🈴_Allies_And_Ethics/).
