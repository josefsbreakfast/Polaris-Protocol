# 🧻🐯 Paper-Thin Tigers (Samizdat Edition)  
*Jokes you’re not supposed to tell about strongmen.*

---

## The Principle  
Authoritarians can jail dissidents, build prisons, even run death camps.  
But they are **paper-thin tigers** if they cannot take a joke.  

---

## Quick Jokes  
- **Putin:** Bootleg Karate Kid judo master; Tsar of Bentleys and babushka poverty.  
- **Xi:** Banned Winnie the Pooh but not poverty.  
- **Modi:** More costume changes than policies.  
- **Sisi:** Pharaoh cosplay with fewer pyramids.  
- **MBS:** Can buy football clubs, can’t buy humour.  
- **Bukele:** Tech-bro dictator, prison influencer.  
- **Trump:** Thinks he’s the dealer, but he’s the deal.

## Closing Line  
*You can have as many death camps as you want — but you are not a strong man if you cannot take a joke.*  

---

*Samizdat spreads by hand, by screenshot, by whisper.  
It laughs where fear tells us not to.*
