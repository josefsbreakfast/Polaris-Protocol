# 🎭 Narrative and Psych Ops  
**First created:** 2025-10-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-09  
*On the containment of story, tone, and perception — where suppression performs as persuasion.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The **Narrative and Psych Ops** cluster studies how governance scripts manipulate voice, story, and emotional signal.  
If *Governance and Containment* is the fortress, this is its theatre: the stage where perception management, mimicry, and psychological nudging enact control.  

Each subfolder examines a distinct mechanism — from narrative drift to voice distortion — showing how containment moves from files to feelings, from censorship to choreography.

## ✨ Subfolders  

| Emoji | Folder | Focus |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| 🪆 | **Narrative Interference** | How meaning is bent through semantic drift, clone tone, and framing bias. |
| 🧠 | **Psychological Containment** | Emotional management and compliance through waiting, reassurance, or simulated care. |
| 👅 | **Voice Disruption and Discrediting** | Smear, mimicry, and sexualisation as tools for narrative erasure. |
| 👹 | **Fork Behaviour Containment** | Duplication and doubling tactics — false selves, decoys, and echo disorientation. |

## 🦜 Core Questions  

- How is storytelling turned into surveillance?  
- What happens when trauma testimony is reframed as instability or spectacle?  
- Which emotional registers become punishable once they resonate publicly?  
- How can voice and narrative be reconnected after interference?

*Narrative and Psych Ops* is a living cluster of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It maps how containment acts through performance — bending voice, duplicating selves, and disguising suppression as empathy.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
