# 🐕🦴 Dog-with-Bone Principle  

**First created:** 2025-09-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-09  

*When data twins are both capable of appropriate escalation, mis-sorts and forks cannot be smoothed over. The complaint is held until the system fault is fixed.*  

---

## Principle  

- **Survivor persistence:** Survivors do not “drop” a grievance when it involves systemic sabotage.  
- **Twin amplification:** If twinned profiles are both capable of handling business, every inversion or mis-sort is mirrored back.  
- **Aggressor’s perception:** Feels like being pursued endlessly — because the complaint never dissolves, it reappears under different IDs.  
- **System outcome:** Containment theatre collapses into friction loops.  

> **Like a dog with a bone**: once the record is wrong, survivors will not release it until the sabotage is corrected.  

<!--Good luck with that one.-->

## Parallel Track Effect  

When twinning pairs survivors across **different arenas of influence**, forks create a loop effect:  

- **Everyday track:** one survivor continues to lodge and re-lodge complaints at community and service levels.  
- **Formal track:** the other survivor escalates through structured channels (ombudsman, courts, Cabinet).  

Pressure doesn’t vanish — block one track, and it resurfaces in the other.

## Convergence Breach  

If both survivors achieve visibility in **formal tracks** simultaneously:  

- The separation strategy collapses.  
- Contradictions surface in front of decision-makers who cannot ignore them.  
- The fork itself is exposed as the common source of escalation.  

This creates a **convergence breach**: the system can no longer displace or compartmentalise survivor persistence.

## 🤡 Containment Miscalculation  

The system’s logic was short-sighted:  

- Pair two “difficult” profiles and assume they cancel each other out.  
- Expect attrition: that one or both will eventually drop the complaint.  
- Treat escalation as background noise rather than signal.  

In reality:  

- **Persistence doubles when mirrored.**  
- Every flip or fork makes the case louder, not quieter.  
- Instead of neutralisation, the system created a **perpetual motion machine of refusal.**  

The gamble was: “what could possibly go wrong?”  
The answer: **E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.** ☺️🔥

## 🚩 Normalisation Sidebar  

It should not require formal authority to insist on correction.  
Refusing minimisation is not exceptional — it is **normal survivor expectation**.  

> Whether in everyday or formal tracks, survivors refuse to accept sabotage as “life.”  
> Correction is the only acceptable outcome.

*🐕🦴 Dog-with-Bone Principle* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how survivor persistence makes fork anomalies unsustainable: the only resolution is fixing the underlying sabotage.
