# 👹 Forked narrative risk in multi-party contexts  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*How diverging accounts emerge once collective silence collapses.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents **forked narrative risk**:  
the moment in multi-party governance contexts where **accounts of events diverge**, not because facts change, but because **actors reframe their own involvement once collective alignment breaks down**.

Forked narratives are not necessarily lies.  
They are the natural outcome of **responsibility differentiation under scrutiny**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Diverging timelines across actors  
- Selective framing of involvement  
- Narrowing of responsibility scope  
- Inconsistent descriptions of the same process  
- Increased exposure through comparison  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. What forked narrative risk is  

Forked narrative risk arises when:

> **multiple actors describe the same events differently once they are no longer coordinating response**

This typically follows:
- sustained scrutiny  
- regulatory attention  
- internal risk reassessment  
- or the collapse of collective silence  

---

### 2. Why narratives fork  

Once responsibility is no longer shared, actors optimise for:
- self-protection  
- reputational clarity  
- procedural defensibility  

This produces narratives that:
- emphasise what *they* did correctly  
- minimise what they controlled  
- reframe what belonged to others  
- stress informational boundaries  

The divergence is strategic, not conspiratorial.

---

### 3. The role of documentation  

Forked narratives often reveal themselves through:
- mismatched timelines  
- differing descriptions of decision points  
- inconsistent justifications for delay  
- selective disclosure of records  

When placed side by side, these accounts expose **structural inconsistencies**.

---

### 4. Why forked narratives increase risk  

Divergence creates risk because:
- inconsistencies are easy to spot  
- comparative scrutiny intensifies  
- credibility erodes unevenly  
- silence becomes impossible to maintain  

Once narratives fork, alignment cannot be restored without explicit reconciliation.

---

### 5. Forking as a post-hinge phenomenon  

Forked narrative risk usually appears **after**:
- the hinge point where delay becomes liability, or  
- a first-mover breaks silence  

It marks a shift from collective defence to **individual narrative survival**.

*Forked narrative risk in multi-party contexts* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how diverging accounts emerge once shared silence collapses, increasing exposure through comparison rather than accusation.
