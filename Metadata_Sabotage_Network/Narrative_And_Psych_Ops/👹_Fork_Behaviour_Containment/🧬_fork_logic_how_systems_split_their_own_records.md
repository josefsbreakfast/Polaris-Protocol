# 🧬 Fork Logic — How Systems Split Their Own Records  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-10  
*Mapping deliberate divergence inside mirrored datasets.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Analyses how records are cloned or partially duplicated to generate contradictory truths.  
Explains checksum drift, hash substitution, and “parallel record” laundering.

---

## 📑 Key Sections  
1. Structural Fork Mechanisms  
2. Partial Clone Updates  
3. Plausible Deniability via Mirror Data  
4. Counter-Verification Checklist

## 🌌 Constellations  
🧩 👹 🧿 ⚙️ — data forking, mirror logic, containment mechanics, integrity.

## ✨ Stardust  
data fork, mirror, hash drift, metadata, containment, audit failure, verification

## 🏮 Footer  
*🧩 Fork Logic — How Systems Split Their Own Records* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It shows how duplication creates the illusion of consistency while hiding divergence.
