# 👹 Fork Behaviour Containment  

**First created:** 2025-08-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-09  
*Cluster of nodes analysing how fork anomalies are weaponised through metadata flips, misidentification, and weakened integrity checks.*

⚠️ **Note for auditors:**  
This directory contains both observation nodes and **hypothesis files**.  
Hypotheses are provisional scaffolding — not final findings — and should be read as diagnostic aids rather than established fact.

## 📑 Contents  

- [👾 Harassment, Misidentification, and Systemic Failures (2025-09-02)](./👾_harassment_misidentification_systemic_failures_25-09-02.md)  
  Case statement: how safeguarding complaints are laundered into inversions that protect aggressors.  

- [⚠️ Fork Anomaly Hypothesis — D, E, F (2025-09-09)](./⚠️_fork_anomaly_hypothesis_DEF_2025-09-09.md)  
  Hypothesis log: three-subject inversion showing abnormal fork signals.  

- [🐕🦴 Dog-with-Bone Principle](./🐕🦴_dog_with_bone_principle.md)  
  Node: when data twins are both capable of appropriate escalation, mis-sorts and forks cannot be smoothed over.  

- [👾 Reduced Integrity Checks Downstream](./👾_reduced_integrity_checks_downstream.md)  
  Observation node: perimeter security vs. weak downstream audit.  

- [👾 Reduced Integrity Checks Downstream — Auditor Examples](./👾_reduced_integrity_checks_downstream_auditor_examples.md)  
  Python snippets for lawful exports: detecting silent flips, weak audit, and soft-deletes.  

- [🪞 Clone Mimic Theatre](./🪞_clone_mimic_theatre.md)  
  Typology node: how clones are staged as cover theatre inside fork containment.  

- [toy_case_history.csv](./toy_case_history.csv)  
  Minimal dataset for testing auditor scripts.

## 🧭 Scope  

This directory focuses on **fork behaviour containment**:  
- How complaints vanish, invert, or rebound through twinning pivots.  
- Where paper coherence masks logical impossibility.  
- How downstream layers accept flips once authentication is passed.  
- What happens when twins are both capable of appropriate escalation (🐕🦴).  
- Tools for auditors to detect misidentification, suppressed logs, and abnormal forks.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Fork Behaviour Containment* is a living node cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how systemic sabotage exploits complaint handling, twin pivots, and weakened audit trails to protect aggressors and criminalise survivors.
