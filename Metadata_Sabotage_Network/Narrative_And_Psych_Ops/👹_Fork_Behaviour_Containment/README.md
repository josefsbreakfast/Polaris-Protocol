# 👹 Fork Behaviour Containment  
**First created:** 2025-08-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*Cluster analysing how fork anomalies weaponise complaint systems through metadata flips, misidentification, and weakened integrity checks.*

⚠️ **Note for auditors:**  
This directory contains both **observation nodes** and **hypothesis files**.  
Hypotheses are provisional scaffolds — not final findings — and should be read as diagnostic aids rather than established fact.

## 🥭 Contents  

- [⚖️ Capacity as Integrity — Why Oversubscription Breeds Error](./⚖️_capacity_as_integrity_why_oversubscription_breeds_error.md)

## 🧿 Scope  

This cluster documents how **fork behaviour containment** functions as a systemic defence mechanism:  

- When complaints vanish, invert, or rebound through twin pivots.  
- When **paper coherence masks logical impossibility**.  
- When downstream layers accept authentication once and never question it again.  
- When both twins behave correctly (🐕🦴) but the system still selects one for erasure.  
- When mimic theatre (🪞, 🌩️) provides visual cover for structural sabotage.  
- When audit fatigue (🪼) becomes the final layer of suppression.  

Together, these nodes map how error containment becomes narrative containment.

*👹 Fork Behaviour Containment* is a living node cluster of the Polaris Protocol.  
It analyses how systemic sabotage exploits complaint handling, twin pivots, and weakened audit trails to protect aggressors and criminalise survivors.
