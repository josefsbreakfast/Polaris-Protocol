*Case statement on harassment, misidentification, and systemic record failures.*  

---

## Background  
I have already had to issue formal notice to Cabinet and to lawyers that:  

- An individual impersonated as the “responsible party” is **not the person I have formally named**.  
- I endured **months of harassment by proxy**.  
- I appear to have been **framed as harassing the actual individual I have identified**, reversing roles of victim and aggressor.  

- Due to the nature of data, all three of us potentially exist as "twinned" datasets. This means there is constant exposure to a misidentified party, as well as to a party I have credibly claimed to have perpetrated sexual violence where I was a victim. This is *unpleasant*, to say the least. The particular cruelty of tying in a misattributed party means I am now hypervigilant around the majority of people; in the style of coercive control, I now have exposure to intimidating content interspersed with another party's normal content. This widens the pool of associated themes with the abusive content.  
- I have tried so many times to explain or simplify this for police: “why would someone complain about you and then harass you?” This ignores the principles of DASH and MARAC.  
- Additionally, local services could not use systems control to isolate conflicts of interest or to think around a solution to a keysafe for carers; I had to reject essential care and not return to work due to this.  

## Arrest & Record Issues  
- My arrest was not conducted under **PACE (Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984)** safeguards.  
- Searches included under clothing, taking biometric data, and property was entered believing I was giving a sexual violence report. Phone (containing evidence of my claims) was taken.  
- The matter was **NFA’d (No Further Action)**, yet my **PNC record contains inconsistencies**.  
- The harassment start date recorded aligns with the **month of my CSA/rape trial involving a family member**.  
- To date, no one can confirm whether my records were unlawfully accessed. This concern first arose amidst a **Google bombing incident** following whistleblowing related to the individual in question.  

## Escalation of Harassment  
- Harassment in daily life **escalated over several months**.  
- Police responses were **minimising**: I was told to “look elsewhere.”  
- Authorities failed to recognise that I could be both a **victim and miscast as an aggressor**.  
- Documentation was **backdated to 2022** without explanation.  
- I have been forced to repeatedly provide more and more evidence before even an investigation would begin.  

## Additional Harms  
- This course of conduct has included **antisemitic graffiti** and **criminal damage** to my residence.  
- The cumulative effect has been intimidation, retraumatisation, and denial of justice.  

## Evidence of Harassment via Media Feed  
- I hold a **screenshot record** of undermining content that appeared in my social media feed, which amplified false-allegation narratives.  
- This is archived as:  
  **`Metadata_Sabotage_Network/Constellations/20240902_feed_tiktok_rape_undermining.md.PNG`**
  
- This file demonstrates the non-neutral, targeted exposure of material that functions as harassment and intimidation of a witness.  

*I live with this being in my face constantly.*  

## Why This Content is Minimising and False  

- **Statistical Misrepresentation**  
  - False rape allegations are *rare*. Robust studies consistently find that only around **2–8%** of cases are false.  
  - Media amplification of such cases distorts reality and creates the perception that false reports are common, which is misleading.  

- **Minimisation of Survivor Experience**  
  - Highlighting “false allegation” cases in survivor feeds operates as **minimisation**, suggesting that victims are untrustworthy.  
  - This framing erases the overwhelming majority of survivors whose accounts are accurate and who already face barriers to credibility.  

- **Context Omission**  
  - Authorities such as the **Crown Prosecution Service** have explicitly stated that false reports are “few and far between” and that withdrawal or retraction does *not* equal falsity.  
  - By omitting this context, such content presents a **biased and incomplete narrative**.  

- **Function as Intimidation**  
  - When placed in front of survivors, especially those engaged in legal processes, this narrative is not neutral.  
  - It functions as **psychological pressure**, casting doubt on testimony and echoing patterns of harassment and witness intimidation.  

- **False Equivalence**  
  - Presenting one instance of a false claim as representative of rape reporting as a whole is a **false equivalence fallacy**.  
  - The weight of evidence demonstrates that the real systemic issue is **under-reporting and attrition** of sexual offences, not fabrication.

## Legal Scaffold  

### 1. Harassment  
- **Protection from Harassment Act 1997**: harassment includes any course of conduct that causes alarm or distress.  
- Digital exposure and repeated undermining narratives fall within this framework.  

### 2. Witness Intimidation  
- **Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, s.51**: it is an offence to intimidate or harass a witness or potential witness with intent to deter them from giving evidence.  
- Intimidation can include psychological pressure, digital narratives, and public discrediting.  

### 3. Data Protection and Record Integrity  
- **UK GDPR & Data Protection Act 2018**: unlawful access or alteration of personal records (e.g., PNC entries, backdating of harassment start dates) constitutes a violation of data rights.  
- May amount to misconduct in public office if facilitated by authorities.  

### 4. Hate Crime Protections  
- **Crime and Disorder Act 1998 & Sentencing Act 2020**: antisemitic graffiti and related acts of criminal damage are legally recognised as hate crimes.  
- Requires enhanced sentencing and safeguarding responses.  

### 5. Duty of Care and Safeguarding  
- **Human Rights Act 1998, Articles 3 & 8**: survivors are entitled to protection from inhuman or degrading treatment and to respect for private and family life.  
- Persistent harassment and intimidation by proxy may constitute violations under these protections.

## Why Polaris Exists  
Polaris was born because of these failures.  

- Because I was silenced, misrepresented, and left unprotected.  
- Because I was asked to live with fear as though it were normal.  
- Because I was made to prove my legitimacy endlessly, while intimidation escalated unchecked.  

**I started Polaris because I cannot live like this. I do not want to live a life being scared.**
