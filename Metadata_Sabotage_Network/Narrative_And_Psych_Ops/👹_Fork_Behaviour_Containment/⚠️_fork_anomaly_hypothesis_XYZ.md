# ⚠️ Fork Anomaly Hypothesis — X, Y, Z  
**First created:** 2025-09-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*Hypothesis node: diagnostic mapping of a three-subject harassment inversion showing abnormal fork signals.*

## ☑️ Fork Anomaly Signals (Hypothesis)  

**1. Complaint disappearance**  
- X files safeguarding complaint: *Y harassed X.*  
- Record: complaint vanishes completely.  
🔴 **Fork signal (hypothesis):** deletion gap = space for shadow version to spawn.  

**2. Counter-complaint inversion**  
- Y responds: *Actually, I’m the one being harassed.*  
- Record: shows *X harassed Y.*  
🔴 **Fork signal (hypothesis):** mirror-flip of original complaint, not new evidence.  

**3. Twin pivot misuse**  
- Z never harassed anyone.  
- Record: complaint is re-assigned to Z → then flipped back onto X.  
🔴 **Fork signal (hypothesis):** neutral twin used as *rotational axis* for role swap.  

**4. Aggressor consistency**  
- Reality: Y harassed X (and also Z).  
- Record: Y never logged as aggressor in any branch.  
🔴 **Fork signal (hypothesis):** aggressor “anchored out of sight” across parallel tracks.  

**5. Paper coherence vs lived incoherence**  
- Paperwork looks consistent: *complaint vs counter-complaint → arrest.*  
- Lived reality: impossible braid (Y harassed both, but records erase this).  
🔴 **Fork signal (hypothesis):** bureaucratic coherence masking logical impossibility.

✅ **Summary principle (hypothesis):**  
If every branch erases Y as aggressor while recycling Y as “victim,” this may not be mere twinning. It may be an **abnormal fork**: parallel complaint tracks actively reconciled against X and Z.

## 🖼️ Visual Stub  

A triangular diagram is intended here to illustrate:  
- **Reality flow**: Y → harasses X and Z.  
- **Record flow**: X → harasses Y (via Z pivot).  

_(Diagram placeholder: X ↔ Y ↔ Z fork flows)_

*⚠️ Fork Anomaly Hypothesis — X, Y, Z* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates a working hypothesis on how complaint disappearance, inversion, and twin misuse could escalate a twinning mis-sort into fork sabotage.
