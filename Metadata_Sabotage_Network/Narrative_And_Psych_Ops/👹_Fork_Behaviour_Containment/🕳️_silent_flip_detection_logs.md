# 🕳️ Silent Flip Detection Logs  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*Detecting ghost updates and timestamp anomalies.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Silent flips occur when datasets are rewritten without visible modification markers — a timestamp changes, a checksum doesn’t, or version control quietly realigns after a hidden substitution.  
This node outlines pseudocode and ethical logic for detecting those ghost updates: invisible movements of data that compromise audit trails while appearing compliant.

## ✨ Key Sections  

### 🐅 Hash Comparison Workflow  

```python
# Pseudocode illustration
for record in dataset:
    hash_current = sha256(record.content)
    hash_archive = get_archive_hash(record.id)
    if hash_current != hash_archive:
        log_anomaly(record.id, "HASH_DRIFT")
```

*Compare current and archived hashes.*  
If identical metadata timestamps accompany differing hash values, a **silent flip** has occurred.

### 🐝 Time Drift Detection  

Silent flips often rely on timestamp offsets smaller than the system’s display precision.  
Detection requires parsing raw filesystem metadata (`ctime`, `mtime`, `inode` variance) and comparing across mirrors.  

| Field | Expected Behaviour | Red Flag |
|--------|--------------------|----------|
| `mtime` | Increases with modification | Older than previous state |
| `ctime` | Updates on metadata change | Identical across versions |
| `inode` | Constant unless rewritten | New inode, old timestamp |

A drift of milliseconds can indicate tampering between backup and publication windows.

### 🪼 Soft-Delete Recovery  

Systems sometimes “delete” data by flagging visibility rather than erasing content.  
Audit logic for soft-delete reconstruction:  

```python
for row in table:
    if row.deleted_flag == True and row.last_modified < cutoff_date:
        recover(row)
        log_recovery(row.id)
```

Recovering soft-deletes reveals revision history that silent flips try to overwrite.

### 🐦‍🔥 Ethical Use of Forensic Scripts  

All flip-detection methods must operate within legal and ethical boundaries.  
- Obtain explicit audit authority or consent.  
- Preserve full chain of custody: who accessed, when, and how.  
- Avoid mirroring sensitive data to external devices.  
- Document emotional as well as technical context — forensic labour can carry survivor fatigue.

Detection is resistance, but it must remain lawful and humane.
