## 🛰️ Orientation  

When contradiction becomes institutional, personality follows.  
**Behavioural forks** describe the process by which organisations cultivate dual or multiple personas — one ethical for public display, another pragmatic for internal survival.  
This node explores how contradictory messaging and compartmentalised conscience enable ongoing containment while maintaining plausible virtue.

## ✨ Key Sections  

### 🪼 Frontstage vs Backstage Ethics  
Institutions maintain a *frontstage* of principle — codes of conduct, glossy ESG reports, equity pledges — while backstage behaviours prioritise loyalty, funding, or political expediency.  
The gap between stage and backstage becomes an *ethical airlock*: oxygenated enough for statements, too thin for reform.

### 💫 Contradictory Messaging Loops  
Public-facing communications claim transparency; internal memos emphasise discretion.  
This looping behaviour produces what sociologists call **managed contradiction** — a reflex where departments communicate opposite truths to different audiences, both “accurate” in context, neither reconcilable.

### 🧠 Cognitive Dissonance as Governance  
Rather than resolve dissonance, institutions institutionalise it.  
Compliance teams manage ethical discomfort like IT manages latency: acceptable within tolerance bands.  
Dissonance becomes a governance tool — it keeps staff functional within paradox.  
The price is moral numbness and survivor disbelief.

### 🐦‍🔥 Integration and Repair  
Repair begins with **whole-system visibility**:  
- identify duplicated narratives and the incentives sustaining them;  
- allow whistle-flow between internal and external channels;  
- introduce reflexive review where ethics teams audit themselves.  
Integration is less about unity than transparency of multiplicity — acknowledging the split as evidence, not defect.

*🧠 Behavioural Forks — When Institutions Develop Split Personas* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It shows how organisations practice ethical ventriloquy to survive contradiction and how integration begins by naming the split.
