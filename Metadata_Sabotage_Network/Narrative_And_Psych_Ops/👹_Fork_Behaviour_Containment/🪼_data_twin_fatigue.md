# 🪼 Data Twin Fatigue — When Reconciliation Becomes Impossible  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*The exhaustion of endless verification.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

In systems built on duplication, reconciliation becomes a lifestyle.  
Auditors, survivors, and compliance staff spend months comparing “data twins” — datasets that should match but never quite do.  
This node explores the psychological and operational burnout that emerges when every act of verification exposes a new contradiction.

## ✨ Key Sections  

### 🪼 Audit Fatigue  
Endless comparison erodes focus.  
Each dataset claims authority; none reconcile.  
The result is **epistemic vertigo** — a sense that truth exists only as a moving average.  
Auditors learn to triage, not to trust.

### 🧠 Emotional Cost of Contradiction  
For survivors asked to “prove” harm across conflicting records, contradiction becomes a moral weight.  
Every discrepancy re-opens disbelief: the system’s failure recast as personal doubt.  
This is not just data fatigue; it is **credibility fatigue**.

### 🏛️ Institutional Apathy  
As contradictions multiply, institutions normalise them.  
Review boards shrug: “that’s just data lag.”  
But apathy is policy by another name — a slow refusal that protects the fiction of order.

### 🦆 Repair by Rest  
Reconciliation is not always possible.  
Rest becomes a radical audit practice: stepping back to let systems expose their own inconsistency.  
Authenticity returns through **pause**, not productivity.

*🪼 Data Twin Fatigue — When Reconciliation Becomes Impossible* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It recognises exhaustion as a predictable outcome of structural contradiction and reframes rest as forensic resistance.
