# 🧩 Harassment Is Not an Event

*Why digital harm must be understood as a lifecycle rather than an incident*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

Harassment is commonly framed as an event:
a message sent, a threat made, a report filed, a case closed.

This framing is inherited from offline models of harm.
It fails in digital environments.

Once harassment enters networked systems, it frequently persists beyond
the originating behaviour through replication, indexing, aggregation,
and recontextualisation.

This node reframes harassment as a **process with an afterlife**.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Harassment outlives the perpetrator’s actions.
- Digital systems preserve semantics without context.
- Closure at the event level does not end exposure.
- Impact continues without renewed intent.
- Survivors experience harm environmentally, not episodically.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content

### 1) The limits of the event model
The event model assumes:
- a clear beginning and end,
- identifiable actors,
- resolution through intervention,
- and temporal containment.

Digital systems violate these assumptions.

Replication, caching, and search ensure that fragments of harm remain
discoverable long after the original interaction ends.

---

### 2) Harassment as a lifecycle
A more accurate model includes stages:

1. Origin — harassment, defamation, or hostile material appears.
2. Capture — content is indexed, scraped, archived, or mirrored.
3. Fragmentation — context collapses; semantics persist.
4. Replication — derivative material proliferates.
5. Resurfacing — fragments reappear across time and platforms.
6. Encounter — the affected person repeatedly meets the residue.

The lifecycle does not require continued action by the perpetrator.

---

### 3) Why “nothing new is happening” is often untrue
Even when no one is acting now, systems continue to:
- surface old material,
- associate identities with threat-shaped language,
- and reproduce hostile contexts.

From the survivor’s perspective, the environment is still active.

This is not misperception.
It is structural persistence.

---

### 4) Institutional mismatch
Most responses target:
- the person who acted,
- the moment of action,
- or the initial platform.

They rarely address:
- downstream replication,
- third-party aggregators,
- search and indexing systems,
- or data broker ecosystems.

As a result, responsibility ends while impact continues.

---

### 5) Relationship to algorithmic violence
Once harassment becomes data, it can be:
- ranked,
- classified,
- recombined,
- and amplified by systems optimised for visibility.

At this stage, harm is no longer interpersonal.
It is algorithmic and environmental.

---

### 6) Lived consequences
Treating harassment as an event leaves survivors:
- managing long-tail exposure alone,
- repeatedly re-assessing safety,
- correcting representations without authority,
- and absorbing cumulative stress without closure.

The harm is not dramatic.
It is chronic.

---

### 7) Why this reframing matters
Understanding harassment as a lifecycle:
- clarifies why recovery is slow,
- explains persistent distress without new incidents,
- shifts focus from intent to infrastructure,
- and supports proportionate, system-level responses.

This reframing restores accuracy.

*Harassment Is Not an Event* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It reframes digital harassment as a lifecycle shaped by replication,
infrastructure, and persistence rather than a discrete incident.
