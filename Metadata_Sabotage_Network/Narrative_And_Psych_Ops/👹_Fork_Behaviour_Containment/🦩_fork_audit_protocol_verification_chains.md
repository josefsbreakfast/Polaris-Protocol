# 🦩 Fork Audit Protocol — Structured Method for Verification Chains  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-16  
*A standard procedure for forensic fork review.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

The **Fork Audit Protocol (FAP)** provides a structured, repeatable method for confirming divergence between mirrored datasets.  
It serves as a countermeasure to the systemic opacity described in *Fork Logic* — turning duplication into evidence rather than confusion.  
This node outlines procedural steps for ethical verification chains across digital archives, platforms, or institutional record systems.

## 📑 Key Sections  

### 1. Initial Integrity Check  
1. Identify all known dataset mirrors and replication points.  
2. Extract file metadata: timestamps, permissions, hash values (SHA-256 minimum).  
3. Run checksum comparison across mirrors; log mismatches as potential forks.  
4. Confirm replication schedules and identify maintenance windows where divergence could occur.  
5. Preserve raw logs in immutable storage for chain-of-custody integrity.

### 2. Cross-Mirror Comparison  
1. Compare record counts, schema definitions, and field hierarchies.  
2. Note any silent field omission or renaming patterns.  
3. Verify that foreign keys, indices, and referential integrity constraints are identical.  
4. Conduct **delta analysis** — byte-level diffing between exports.  
5. Cross-reference with API endpoint outputs to detect presentation-layer masking.

### 3. Anomaly Tagging  
1. Label anomalies using a simple tri-code system:  
   - `S` = Structural (schema or field drift)  
   - `C` = Content (data value alteration)  
   - `M` = Metadata (timestamp, hash, or permission change)  
2. Record anomaly context, suspected source, and downstream implications.  
3. Assign severity based on reproducibility and systemic reach.  
4. Escalate to independent reviewers for blind verification.  

### 4. Reporting and Disclosure  
1. Compile verified anomalies into a **Fork Ledger** with timestamps and hash proofs.  
2. Include both machine logs and human notes of fatigue, resistance, or obstruction during audit.  
3. Publish executive summary distinguishing deliberate from accidental divergence.  
4. Archive all evidence within a tamper-evident repository.  
5. Share findings with affected individuals before institutional release — *disclosure as reparation*.

*Fork Audit Protocol — Structured Method for Verification Chains* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It defines a reproducible methodology for verifying, documenting, and ethically disclosing systemic divergence within mirrored record environments.
