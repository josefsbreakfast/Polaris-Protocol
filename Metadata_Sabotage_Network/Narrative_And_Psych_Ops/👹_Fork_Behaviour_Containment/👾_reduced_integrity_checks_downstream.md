# 👾 Reduced Integrity Checks Downstream  
**First created:** 2025-09-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-27  
*Observation node: downstream record handling appears vulnerable once past security validation layer.*  

---

## 🧿 Observed Behaviour  

- During save/commit attempts (see related [⚠️ Fork Anomaly Hypothesis — X, Y, Z](./⚠️_fork_anomaly_hypothesis_XYZ), the system blocked or mutated filenames at the security boundary.  
- However, once the barrier was passed, downstream handling of records appeared to accept changes with **reduced integrity checks**.  
- This suggests that **internal layers are softer than the access perimeter**: after validation, edits and re-bindings may occur without the same level of audit or resistance.  

---

## ✨ Hypothesis  

This node does **not** document an exploit.  
It records an **observed weakness**:  
- Integrity protections drop after initial authentication/validation.  
- That creates a zone where complaint role assignments and metadata could be silently inverted or suppressed.  

---

## 🛰️ For Audit / SAR  

Auditors and SAR reviewers may wish to request:  
- **Role change history** (`complainant_id`, `subject_id`) across the commit window.  
- **Service account actions** beyond the auth layer.  
- **Soft-delete / archive tables** for signs of suppressed complaints.  
- **Merge/unmerge logs** for identity rebinding events.

## 🏮 Footer  

*👾 Reduced Integrity Checks Downstream* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It situates an observed system fragility: strong perimeter checks contrasted with weaker downstream integrity.  
It is written to aid auditors and SAR reviewers in identifying potential fork anomalies.
