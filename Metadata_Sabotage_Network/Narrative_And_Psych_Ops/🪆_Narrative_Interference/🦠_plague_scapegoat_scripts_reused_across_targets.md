# 🦠 Plague Scapegoat Scripts Reused Across Targets  
**First created:** 2025-12-22 | **Last updated:** 2026-02-20  
*How societies repeatedly recycle the same blame narratives under stress — and why these scripts reliably degrade security analysis.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

When societies face crisis — disease, economic shock, war, or systemic failure — a familiar pattern emerges:

A vulnerable or marginalised group is accused of:
- causing the crisis,
- profiting from it,
- spreading it intentionally,
- or undermining the “body politic” from within.

The targets change.  
The script does not.

This node examines scapegoating as a **reusable narrative technology**, not a historical curiosity.

---

## 🦠 The Core Script

Across centuries and contexts, plague scapegoat narratives follow a stable structure:

1. **Crisis without clear cause**  
2. **High fear, low control**  
3. **Need for moral clarity**  
4. **Identification of an “inside outsider”**  
5. **Attribution of intent, contamination, or sabotage**  

The accusation is rarely evidence-based.
Its function is **psychological and political stabilisation**.

CRAKEN rule:
> Scapegoating reduces uncertainty by converting complexity into hostility.

---

## 🔁 Script Reuse, Not Reinvention

The same core accusations recur with minimal modification:

- poisoning wells  
- spreading disease  
- undermining health or morality  
- corrupting institutions  
- conspiring across borders  
- refusing assimilation  
- benefiting from chaos  

What changes is only:
- the name,
- the ethnicity,
- the religion,
- the nationality,
- or the migration status.

CRAKEN observation:
> Scapegoat narratives are copied because they are cheap, familiar, and effective.

---

## 🧠 Why These Scripts Are So Durable

Scapegoat scripts persist because they:
- require no new evidence,
- align with existing prejudice,
- provide emotional release,
- legitimise coercive policy,
- and protect powerful actors from scrutiny.

They also:
- travel easily across media,
- compress into headlines,
- and reward certainty over nuance.

This makes them ideal under time pressure.

## ⚠️ Security Consequences of Scapegoating

From a defence perspective, scapegoat scripts are **actively dangerous**.

They:
- misdirect threat assessment,
- collapse hypothesis space,
- harden bias in analyst communities,
- and blind institutions to alternative actor classes.

CRAKEN translation:
> Every scapegoat absorbs analytical attention that should have been spent on structure.

---

## 🧿 Interaction with Attribution and Narrative Capture

In modern security contexts, plague scripts often surface as:
- “foreign contamination” narratives,
- civilisational threat framing,
- racialised biosecurity discourse,
- or cultural explanations for systemic failure.

Once activated:
- attribution hardens prematurely,
- familiar adversaries absorb blame,
- and domestic or political factors disappear.

This is not accidental.
It is **narrative gravity**.

---

## 🔥 Why Crises Reactivate Old Scripts

Crisis conditions that reliably trigger scapegoating include:
- public health emergencies,
- migration pressure,
- economic downturns,
- energy shortages,
- or perceived loss of sovereignty.

CRAKEN rule:
> When systems fail visibly, societies look for bodies to blame before structures to fix.

---

## 🛑 Why “We’re More Rational Now” Is a Risky Assumption

Modern institutions often assume:
- education prevents scapegoating,
- data defeats superstition,
- professionalism ensures neutrality.

History suggests otherwise.

Scapegoat scripts adapt to:
- scientific language,
- bureaucratic framing,
- security vocabulary,
- and policy discourse.

The mechanism survives modernisation.

---

## 🧠 CRAKEN Integration

Within CRAKEN, scapegoat scripts function as:
- **narrative shortcuts** under stress,
- **pressure offloading mechanisms**,
- and **analytical failure modes**.

They:
- redirect fear,
- justify tolerance of harm,
- and enable repeated strategic error.

Identifying script reuse is therefore a **defensive skill**.
