# 🪞 Narrative Self-Repair Index  
**First created:** 2025-11-02 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-02  
*A directory of counter-response tools for linguistic and emotional interference.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This index gathers every repair mechanism within the **Narrative Interference** cluster and links it to its counterpart in the **Survivor Voice Fidelity** drafting rules.  
Its purpose is twofold:  
1. To offer a quick-reference for survivors seeking self-repair after interference.  
2. To ensure consistent tone, cross-linking, and provenance practice across the cluster.

## 🗂️ Structure  

| Interference Type | Counter-Response | Related Node |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Semantic Drift** | Lexical clarity campaigns, definitions archive. | 📚 Narrative Management & Metadata Sabotage |
| **Syntactic Manipulation** | Stylometric baselines, version-controlled drafts. | 💣 Syntactic Drift & Clone-Tone |
| **Clone-Tone Fabrication** | Voiceprint watermarking, humour-based exposure. | 🗣️ Voice Laundering / 🔥 The Strength of Humour |
| **Context Stripping** | Screenshot provenance, full-thread archiving. | 🎪 Moles in the Circus |
| **Narrative Flooding** | Collective amplification of verified originals. | 🧩 Repairing Trust Chains |
| **Tone Laundering / Smoothed Content** | Emotional fidelity logging, undertone preservation. | 🪞 Smoothed Content as Blink Twice |

## 🔍 Analysis / Content  

### 1. Repair as Literacy  
Self-repair depends on understanding how interference works.  
This index acts as a **counter-curriculum**: each tactic of distortion has an equal and opposite literacy practice.

### 2. Feedback Loops of Clarity  
Repair is iterative.  
Once a survivor re-asserts authorship, the act itself becomes data — evidence that resistance can be encoded and taught.

### 3. Maintaining Narrative Provenance  
All repaired statements should feed into the cluster’s **Trace Resistance Framework (.yaml)** for standardisation and replication across other environments.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🪞 Narrative Self-Repair Index* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It functions as a mirror for recovery — mapping distortion types to their repair mechanisms and ensuring fidelity of both tone and record.
