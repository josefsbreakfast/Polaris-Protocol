## 🧭 Orientation  
Containment doesn’t always arrive as policy.  
Most of the time, it walks in disguised as *common sense* — short, confident phrases that sound like reason but function as erasure.  
This node collects the everyday sentences that neutralise variance, distress, or brilliance by declaring them incompatible.

## 🧩  The Classic Lines  

| Catchphrase | Subtext | Containment Function |
|--------------|----------|----------------------|
| “You can’t be gifted and struggle with basics.” | High ability cancels the right to need support. | Collapses multi-dimensional profiles into contradiction. |
| “You’re too articulate to be unwell.” | Illness and eloquence can’t coexist. | Discredits lived experience if it’s well explained. |
| “If it were that bad, you wouldn’t be able to talk about it.” | Expressing distress equals exaggeration. | Weaponises coherence as evidence against credibility. |
| “You’re overthinking it.” | Reflection itself becomes pathology. | Silences analysis, protects flawed process. |
| “We have to be fair to everyone.” | Equality used to justify inflexibility. | Converts empathy into bureaucratic paralysis. |
| “We don’t make exceptions.” | Uniformity as virtue. | Ensures systems never adapt, only people do. |
| “It’s not personal, it’s policy.” | Evacuates responsibility. | Allows harm without guilt. |
| “You seem fine to me.” | Observation replaces diagnosis. | Centres comfort of observer over truth of subject. |

Each one converts lived contradiction into administrative simplicity.

## 🧠  Linguistic Mechanics  

These phrases operate like **compression algorithms**:  
they remove nuance to make complex humans fit limited institutional storage.  
The tone — calm, reasonable, managerial — is part of the containment.

> Denial by syntax: the fewer words you use, the less truth you have to hold.
