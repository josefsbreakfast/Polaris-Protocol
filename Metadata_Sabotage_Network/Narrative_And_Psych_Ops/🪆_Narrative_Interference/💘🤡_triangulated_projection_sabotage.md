*When desire, rivalry, and projection leak into impersonation and narrative sabotage.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation
Triangulated Projection Sabotage occurs when an actor attempts to harm a target by impersonating or invoking a third party, while unconsciously projecting their own emotional fixation, desire, or rivalry onto that third party.

This pattern is common in low-skill spoofing, reputational sabotage, and narrative interference.  
The defining feature is **emotional leakage**: the saboteur cannot conceal their fixation, and it bleeds into tone, detail choice, and narrative framing.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Impersonation of a third party who carries emotional significance to the saboteur  
- Desire, envy, or admiration leaking into the fabricated narrative  
- Sabotage framed as “speaking for” or “protecting” another person  
- Excessive emotional centring of the impersonated figure  
- Narrative incoherence caused by unresolved projection

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. **The Triangle Structure**
Triangulated sabotage always involves:
- **Actor A:** the saboteur  
- **Actor B:** the impersonated or invoked figure  
- **Actor C:** the target of harm  

The sabotage is not primarily about Actor C.  
It is about Actor A’s relationship to Actor B.

### 2. **Projection as Narrative Glue**
The saboteur fills gaps in their fabricated story with their own emotional assumptions:
- what they think Actor B feels  
- what they wish Actor B represented  
- how they imagine Actor B would judge or condemn  

This creates a story that feels emotionally charged but logically unstable.

### 3. **Admiration Leakage**
When the impersonated figure is admired, desired, or envied, this leaks through:
- overly flattering framing  
- exaggerated authority or moral weight  
- implausible emotional intimacy  
- tone that resembles fanfiction more than testimony  

The sabotage becomes a confession of fixation.

### 4. **Why This Fails**
Because the emotional centre of gravity is wrong.  
The narrative revolves around the saboteur’s inner world, not the target’s actions.

Investigators recognise this by asking:
> “Who is emotionally central in this message?”

The answer is almost never the target.

It documents a recurring pattern in narrative attacks where impersonation collapses under the weight of the saboteur’s own emotional preoccupations.
