*How unresolved harm displaces fear onto the visible, the powerless, and the convenient.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node states a core psychological–political mechanism:

> **Fear does not disappear when justice fails.  
> It relocates.**

When legitimate accountability is blocked, fear migrates toward targets that feel actionable — regardless of whether they are responsible.

## 🧠 Fear Is a Problem-Solving Emotion

Fear evolved to:
- identify threats  
- drive protective action  
- motivate boundary enforcement  

When systems function, fear is:
- brief  
- targeted  
- resolved through action  

When justice fails, fear has **nowhere to discharge**.

---

## ⚖️ How Justice Failure Redirects Fear

When people see that:
- powerful actors avoid consequence  
- harm is acknowledged but not resolved  
- institutions defer action  
- truth does not lead to protection  

fear detaches from its original source.

It begins to search for:
- visibility  
- proximity  
- enforceability  

Fear moves **downward and outward**.

---

## 🔄 The Displacement Pattern

The pattern is consistent:

1. serious harm is exposed  
2. accountability stalls  
3. fear remains active  
4. original threat feels untouchable  
5. alternative targets absorb attention  

These targets are often:
- migrants  
- minorities  
- marginalised groups  
- outsiders  
- low-status offenders  

This is not irrational.
It is **misdirected self-protection**.

## 🧩 Why Elites Rarely Absorb Displaced Fear

Fear avoids targets perceived as:
- insulated  
- powerful  
- unreachable  
- institutionally protected  

People do not direct fear where they believe action is impossible.

This is why elite impunity produces **scapegoating rather than calm**.

---

## 🏛️ Authoritarian Capture of Displaced Fear

Authoritarian movements succeed by:
- redirecting fear  
- offering simple targets  
- promising decisive action  
- substituting punishment for justice  

They do not create fear.
They **harvest** it.

Justice failure is their recruitment engine.

---

## 🧨 Why Reassurance Does Not Stop the Movement

Reassurance fails because:
- fear is embodied, not abstract  
- threat perception is unresolved  
- lived experience contradicts messaging  

Without visible justice, reassurance reads as denial.

Fear continues to move.

---

## 🛠️ What Stops Fear From Migrating

Fear stabilises when:
- accountability is visible  
- enforcement is predictable  
- harm is confronted at its source  
- protection feels credible  

Justice **anchors** fear.
Silence disperses it.

---

## 🧮 The Bottom Line

Fear is not the enemy.

Misplaced fear is.

When justice fails:
- fear does not vanish  
- it does not calm  
- it does not listen  

It moves.

And wherever it lands, harm follows.
