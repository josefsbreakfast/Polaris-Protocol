*When attempts to manage the story create greater exposure than openness.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node describes **narrative overcontrol failure**:  
a condition in which institutions attempt to tightly manage messaging, framing, or silence, resulting in **increased scrutiny, suspicion, and reputational damage**.

Rather than reducing risk, excessive narrative control often becomes the primary signal that something is wrong.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Centralised messaging replacing engagement  
- Silence or minimalism interpreted as concealment  
- Messaging discipline overriding responsiveness  
- Loss of credibility through opacity  
- Story management becoming the story

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. What narrative overcontrol looks like  

Narrative overcontrol includes:
- refusal to answer substantive questions  
- excessive reliance on holding statements  
- message alignment without resolution  
- avoidance of timelines or specifics  

These tactics are often justified internally as “discipline.”

---

### 2. Why control backfires  

Observers interpret overcontrol as:
- fear  
- evasiveness  
- lack of confidence  
- reputational panic  

Especially when the issue is ongoing, silence does not read as neutrality — it reads as **active concealment**.

---

### 3. The visibility paradox  

The more tightly a narrative is managed:
> **the more attention is drawn to the absence of explanation**

This creates an exposure loop:
control → suspicion → scrutiny → more control.

---

### 4. Narrative control vs accountability  

Narrative control focuses on *what is said*.  
Accountability focuses on *what is done*.

When the former replaces the latter, credibility collapses.
