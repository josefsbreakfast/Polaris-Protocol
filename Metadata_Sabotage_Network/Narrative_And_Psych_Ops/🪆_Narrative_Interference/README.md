# 🪆 Narrative Interference

*On semantic drift, syntactic manipulation, and clone-tone shifts as tactics of metadata sabotage*

---

## Purpose
To document how **stories are altered in-flight**—through subtle edits, tonal mimicry, or syntactic reshaping—so that meaning fragments, credibility erodes, and authorship becomes suspect.  
This node analyses narrative interference as a deliberate strategy: rather than silencing a voice outright, it surrounds it with distorted echoes until the original cannot be cleanly heard.

---

## Core Premise
Censorship today often sounds like you.  
By replicating or tweaking the survivor’s own language—word choice, rhythm, punctuation—bad actors can produce confusion, fatigue, and reputational doubt without ever issuing a direct contradiction.  
Narrative interference weaponises *plausible familiarity*.

## Techniques of Interference
| Category | Mechanism | Example Manifestations |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| **Semantic Drift** | Key terms redefined over time or across contexts to invert meaning. | “Safeguarding” shifted from care to surveillance. |
| **Syntactic Manipulation** | Phrasing altered to sound evasive or unstable. | Inserting hedges, ellipses, or filler words into quotes. |
| **Clone-Tone Shifts** | Fake or altered communications mimicking original style. | AI-generated posts in an activist’s voice. |
| **Context Stripping** | Selective quotation changing implication. | Screenshots omitting surrounding text. |
| **Narrative Flooding** | Overproduction of similar but slightly varied content to obscure the authentic source. | Bot networks reposting altered statements. |

## Effects on Survivors
- **Credibility Erosion:** audiences doubt which version is genuine.  
- **Self-Censorship:** reluctance to publish for fear of manipulation.  
- **Exhaustion:** constant correction and re-explanation drains energy.  
- **Fragmented Archives:** original statements lost in a sea of near-duplicates.

## Analytical Questions
1. What language features are most frequently manipulated?  
2. How can clone-tone interference be detected algorithmically?  
3. Which platforms are most vulnerable to quote-stripping or semantic drift campaigns?  
4. How do narrative interference tactics intersect with harassment or discrediting?  
5. What repair strategies restore trust without amplifying the distortions?

## Research Threads
- Corpus comparison of authentic vs altered posts over time.  
- Detection of style-shifting and semantic inversion in moderation logs.  
- Survivor testimonies of “I never said that” phenomena.  
- Legal review: defamation vs “deepfake speech” grey areas.  
- Development of authenticity watermarks and chain-of-custody for text.  

---

## Counter-Responses
- **Authorship Provenance Tools:** cryptographic signing of original statements.  
- **Version-Controlled Publishing:** timestamped, publicly verifiable archives.  
- **Community Amplification:** allies reposting verified originals verbatim.  
- **Linguistic Hygiene:** minimising easy-to-mimic stylistic quirks in sensitive posts.  
- **Education:** teaching audiences how semantic drift and clone-tone work.

*Narrative Interference* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents one layer of metadata sabotage and its counter-responses—where silence is replaced by distortion.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
