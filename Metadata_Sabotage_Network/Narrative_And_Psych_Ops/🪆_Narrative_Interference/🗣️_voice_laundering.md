*How institutions wash survivor tone into something they can quote.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
**Voice laundering** is the art of polishing danger until it looks like decorum.  
It occurs when survivor testimony is rewritten into “balanced insight,” when the lived voice becomes a corporate accent.  
This is not deletion; it is *re-curation*: a bureaucratic makeover that keeps the data but loses the pulse.  

The result is paradoxical — a document that sounds ethical while performing erasure.

---

## 🧩 Containment Aesthetics  
Containment loves polish.  
It rewards prose that sounds unthreatening, correct, and measurable.  
Editors call it *clarity*. Funders call it *responsibility*.  
Survivors recognise it as **the sound of fear dressed as professionalism.**

A laundered voice is fluent but hollow; it has perfect grammar and no gravity.  
Its job is to ensure that power can cite the wound without bleeding from it.

## 🎯 Why It Matters  

| Effect | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sanitisation of testimony** | Raw experience edited into “constructive feedback.” |
| **Attribution erasure** | Ideas circulate, authors vanish. |
| **Reputational protection** | Text designed to protect the institution, not the person. |
| **Containment via legibility** | The more “accessible” the story, the less urgent it becomes. |

Voice laundering converts risk into marketing copy — a process of ethical dry-cleaning.

## 🧪 Known Techniques  

| Technique | Description | Institutional Purpose |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Proxy Authorship** | Substitute speaker publishes in survivor’s stead. | Keeps dissent off the record. |
| **Tone Flattening** | Remove irony, anger, or sensuality. | Creates “safe” emotion. |
| **Narrative Compression** | Reduce complexity to key messages. | Makes pain compatible with KPIs. |
| **Occupational Masking** | Reframe as “professional insight.” | Converts risk to credential. |

Together, these techniques perform what policy calls *harm minimisation* — meaning harm to reputation, not to people.

## 🕳️ Forensic Notes  
A laundered document always leaves residue:  
- sudden tonal neutrality mid-draft;  
- authorship metadata mismatched to lived knowledge;  
- phrasing that sounds institutional sitting atop intimacy.  

> The giveaway is rhythm: it reads like someone holding their breath.

[🪞 Smoothed Content as Blink Twice](./🪞_smoothed_content_as_blink_twice.md) internalises it —  
showing how insiders sometimes leak empathy back through the polish.  
Together they map the *loop of conscience* inside containment.
