# 🗣️ Voice Laundering

First created 2025-08-05  

Voice laundering is the act of separating a speaker’s tone, syntax, or emotional cadence from their authorship — and repackaging it under an institutional, compliant, or neutral facade.

## 🎯 Why It Matters

- Sanitises survivor testimony into "acceptable" advocacy.
- Enables institutional appropriation without attribution.
- Protects funders, reputations, and reputational capital — but not people.

## 🧪 Known Techniques

| Technique | Description | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Proxy Authorship** | Replace origin speaker with a “close enough” substitute | Reduces risk of dissenting metadata |
| **Tone Flattening** | Strip emotional register from drafts | Makes survivor accounts legible to power |
| **Narrative Compression** | Edit complex history into bite-sized slogans | Allows weaponised retellings later |
| **Occupational Masking** | Publish through an “acceptable” identity lens | Obscures true risk origin (e.g., sex worker overlay) |

## 🔥 Case Study: The Forked Paper

> Origin: Authored by a metadata-flagged survivor.  
> Outcome: Published under a “relevant sex worker” pseudonym.  
> Result: The original voice was erased; its insight retained.

## 🕳️ Notes

Voice laundering is most effective when the original speaker cannot safely surface. It relies on shame, sealed documents, and flattened platforms.

And it always sounds... just a little off.
