*The institutional process of separating tone and testimony from authorship — sanitising voice into compliance.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
**Voice laundering** occurs when a speaker’s rhythm, syntax, or emotional register is extracted from their testimony and reissued under a neutral, institutional, or “acceptable” facade.  

It is not deletion but **re-curation** — the re-packaging of lived voice into polished advocacy.  
This allows systems to benefit from survivor insight while erasing the risk of survivor presence.  

Voice laundering converts resistance into reputational asset.

## 🎯 Why It Matters  

| Effect | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Sanitisation of testimony** | Raw survivor accounts are edited into “balanced” statements that no longer challenge power. |
| **Attribution erasure** | Insights circulate institutionally while the original author disappears from citation trails. |
| **Reputational protection** | Language re-engineered to safeguard funders and institutional partners rather than people. |
| **Containment via legibility** | Once “professionalised,” testimony loses the urgency that made it dangerous. |

Voice laundering transforms authenticity into public-relations material.

## 🧪 Known Techniques  

| Technique | Description | Institutional Purpose |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Proxy Authorship** | Replace the origin speaker with a “close enough” substitute or consultant. | Reduces dissent risk and metadata exposure. |
| **Tone Flattening** | Strip emotional or sensory language from drafts. | Makes testimony legible to bureaucratic audiences. |
| **Narrative Compression** | Reduce complex experience into slogans or key messages. | Enables future re-use in funding reports or media kits. |
| **Occupational Masking** | Publish through an “acceptable” identity lens (e.g. “sex worker advocate,” “community liaison”). | Disguises where the real threat or insight originated. |

Each method is marketed as “clarity” or “safety” — but together they perform **ethical laundering of lived voice**.

## 🔥 Case Study — *The Forked Paper*  

> **Origin:** Authored by a metadata-flagged survivor.  
> **Outcome:** Published under a “relevant” pseudonym — framed as a professional rather than a witness.  
> **Result:** The institution retained the ideas but erased the author’s risk profile.  

The original paper’s courage became someone else’s credential.

## 🕳️ Forensic Notes  

Voice laundering is most effective when the source cannot safely self-represent.  
It thrives in environments of sealed documents, NDAs, and reputational anxiety.  

Forensic indicators include:  
- Sudden **tonal neutrality** in late-stage drafts.  
- **Shift in authorship metadata** between submission and publication.  
- **Rhetorical incongruity** — phrases that sound institutional but sit atop intimate subject matter.  

It always sounds slightly “off”: fluent, but hollow.  

> The easiest way to recognise a laundered voice is to notice when truth sounds translated.
