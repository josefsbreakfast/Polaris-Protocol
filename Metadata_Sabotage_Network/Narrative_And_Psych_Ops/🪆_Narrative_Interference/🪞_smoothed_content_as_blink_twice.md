*When a threatening artefact doubles as a sub-signal of unease within the suppression system.*  

---

## Summary  
- A “smoothed” study or artefact appeared as intimidation.  
- On second reading, it may also have functioned as a **blink twice signal** from inside the machine.  
- Example of dual-purpose suppression artefacts: threat on surface, subtext of quiet dissent.  

---

## Pattern  
- Suppression industry content often serves multiple functions.  
- Even within containment theatre, some actors leave **breadcrumbs** of discomfort.

It records how content can serve dual roles: intimidation and quiet signalling from within a suppression economy.
