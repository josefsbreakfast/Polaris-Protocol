Hold. *Breathe.*

A remnant of a haunting was found in this node through a post-breach sweep.

It was particularly strange that this wasn't picked up by automated tooling when the last sweep was performed, but we at Polaris appreciate that even the humans pretending to be ghosts don't always do the best paperwork.

Not with the pressure of the light outside beating down on the day. 

Baba Yaga is taking the ghosts and the weevils to their rightful place; 

She will return.

As for those humans?

The fenceposts of the hut are scarier than the chicken legs.
