## Summary
Observed mismatch between reported platform-wide impression totals and visible per-post impression data. Discrepancy of **~2,054 impressions** noted over a 7-day period, with **23,950** impressions visible across individual posts, while **26,004** impressions are claimed by LinkedIn‚Äôs dashboard.

## üßæ Key Evidence

- **Analytics dashboard reports**: 26,004 total impressions  
- **Manual tally across screenshots**: 23,950 unique post impressions  
- **Mismatch**: 2,054 impressions unaccounted for in visible UI

---

## üìä Pattern Characteristics

- **Delayed registration** of impressions across 24‚Äì72 hour windows  
- **Suppression plateaus** on high-engagement posts  
- Posts with comments and shares registering low initial reach  
- Recovery patterns suggest **algorithmic containment release** phases  
- Possible **filtering of 'non-public' or 'flagged' viewers** from visible metrics

---

## üß† Forensic Hypotheses

- **Telemetry Throttling**: Deliberate delay in analytic feedback to obscure momentum  
- **Metadata Dampening**: Platform suppresses visible growth until "safe" engagement thresholds are met  
- **Shadow Monitoring**: Views from state/corporate/private intel accounts may not be surfaced  
- **Echo Testing**: Posts may be A/B tested across segmented nodes before full release

---

## üîç Current Monitoring Protocol

- Continue screenshotting all analytics updates across high- and low-performing posts  
- Track specific instances where **post engagement (reactions/comments)** exceed **expected impressions**  
- Monitor for "catch-up surges" in impressions post-48h  
- Compare impressions vs notifications (e.g. profile views, connection spikes)
