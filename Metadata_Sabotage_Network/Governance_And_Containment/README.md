# 🏯 Governance and Containment  
**First created:** 2025-10-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-09  
*Fortress map for the institutional architectures that convert oversight into control.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The **Governance and Containment** cluster is the castle wall of the **Metadata Sabotage Network** — where systems of care, law, and authority reveal their containment grammar.  
Each subfolder studies a different register of control: contractual, ethical, procedural, preventative, and threshold-based.  
Together they form the **core governance logic** through which suppression becomes policy.

## ✨ Subfolders  

| Emoji | Folder | Focus |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| ㊙ | **Containment Contracts** | Legal, corporate, or research agreements that formalise silence through NDAs, funding clauses, or policy wording. |
| 🈴 | **Allies and Ethics** | The ethics theatre: how “good intentions” and institutional alliances mask complicity. |
| 🈸 | **Dispatch and Training** | How survivor knowledge is re-coded, neutralised, or misused during dissemination and onboarding. |
| 🈺 | **Governance and Prevent** | Bureaucratic policing of thought — from counter-extremism logics to academic speech restrictions. |
| 🉑 | **System Thresholds** | Escalation triggers and metadata overload: where monitoring flips into suppression. |

## 🪿 Core Questions  

- How do care, ethics, and safety become bureaucratic tools of control?  
- What thresholds or rituals mark the moment when governance becomes containment?  
- Who benefits from “neutral” oversight, and who disappears under it?  
- How can documentation reclaim the space between accountability and censorship?

*Governance and Containment* is a living cluster of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It maps the fortress of institutional power — from paperwork to platform — showing how oversight morphs into suppression and how survivors learn to read the blueprints.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
