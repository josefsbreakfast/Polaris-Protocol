# 🧨 Soft Suspension Is Still Containment  
**First created:** 2025-08-11 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-09  
*Analysis of soft suspension as a containment tactic that throttles visibility under the guise of care.*

---

## 🛰️ Overview  

Soft suspension is part of the broader **metadata sabotage network**.  
It replaces visible censorship with *plausibly benevolent* interventions — such as “wellness” prompts or “cooling-off” periods — to dampen engagement and redirect behaviour.  
By presenting as care, moderation, or neutral enforcement, it reduces backlash while still achieving suppression goals.  

---

## ✨ Conceptual Definition  

Not all silencing looks like censorship.  
Sometimes it looks like rest.  
Like timeout.  
Like: *“You’re not in trouble, but...”*  

Soft suspension uses **non-disciplinary limitations** to suppress influence under the guise of care or fairness.  
It operates at the intersection of **behavioural governance** and **visibility throttling**, shifting the burden of silence onto the target.

## 🪼 What It Is  

- Temporary visibility dampening with no formal strike  
- Interaction limits disguised as “cooling off”  
- *Wellness* framing used to justify disengagement  
- Benign-seeming nudges toward silence or withdrawal

## 🧠 Key Features  

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **No clear ban** | You remain online, but your reach is throttled |
| **Wellness language** | Framed as care: “take a break,” “reduce screen time” |
| **Systemic ghosting** | Posts vanish, comments disappear, messages fail silently |
| **Behavioural nudging** | UI signals suggest slowing down or stepping back |

## 🪨 Why It’s Used  

- Avoids public backlash from overt censorship  
- Depletes momentum without visible enforcement  
- Isolates the user in a perceived lull  
- Induces self-censorship disguised as personal choice  

---

## 📡 Signs You’re In It  

- Posts receive no interaction without being deleted  
- Comments vanish mid-thread  
- Notifications drop off on high-engagement topics  
- Platform nudges to “pause,” “log off,” or “cool down”

*Soft Suspension Is Still Containment* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents the strategic substitution of overt censorship with wellness-framed throttling across digital governance systems.
