## Summary
This node documents and analyses **soft suspension** — a containment tactic that throttles influence, limits visibility, and interrupts momentum without imposing an explicit ban or strike.  
It merges both the conceptual definition and operational forensic logging into a single master record for internal reference, legal review, and external publication.

---

## Context
Soft suspension is part of the broader **metadata_sabotage_network** playbook.  
It replaces visible censorship with *plausibly benevolent* interventions — such as “wellness” prompts or “cooling-off” periods — to dampen engagement and redirect behaviour.  
By presenting as care, moderation, or neutral enforcement, it reduces backlash while still achieving suppression goals.

## Body

### Conceptual Definition
Not all silencing looks like censorship.  
Sometimes it looks like rest.  
Like timeout.  
Like: *“You’re not in trouble, but...”*

Soft suspension uses **non-disciplinary limitations** to suppress influence under the guise of care or fairness.  
It operates at the intersection of **behavioural governance** and **visibility throttling**, shifting the burden of silence onto the target.

### What It Is
- Temporary visibility dampening with no formal strike  
- Interaction limits disguised as “cooling off”  
- *Wellness* framing used to justify disengagement  
- Benign-seeming nudges toward silence or withdrawal

### Key Features

| Trait                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **No clear ban**       | You remain online, but your reach is throttled |
| **Wellness language**  | Framed as care: “take a break,” “reduce screen time” |
| **Systemic ghosting**  | Posts vanish, comments disappear, messages fail silently |
| **Behavioural nudging**| UI signals suggest slowing down or stepping back |

### Why It’s Used
- Avoids public backlash from overt censorship  
- Depletes momentum without visible enforcement  
- Isolates the user in a perceived lull  
- Induces self-censorship disguised as personal choice

---

### Signs You’re In It
- Posts receive no interaction without being deleted  
- Comments vanish mid-thread  
- Notifications drop off on high-engagement topics  
- Platform nudges to “pause,” “log off,” or “cool dow
