# 🪫 False Positive Fatigue — When Systems Over-Trigger  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-23  
*The exhaustion produced by constant alerts.*

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
Explores how over-triggering and incessant risk notifications erode attention, empathy, and institutional credibility.  
When every signal is treated as crisis, vigilance collapses into background noise.  
This node maps the shared burnout experienced by both staff and survivors inside high-alert bureaucracies — systems that never power down, and thus stop meaningfully perceiving danger at all.

## ⚙️ Key Sections  

### 1. Alert Inflation  
Continuous escalation creates **signal inflation**:  
each new flag must out-alarm the last to be noticed.  
Thresholds are lowered until the extraordinary becomes ordinary.  
Over time, staff stop believing the alerts; citizens stop reacting to them.  
The system becomes addicted to its own adrenaline.

### 2. Desensitisation as Defence  
To survive chronic alertness, the nervous system withdraws.  
Frontline workers, moderators, clinicians, and subjects of monitoring alike develop emotional callouses.  
This is not apathy — it is **protective numbing**, a self-stabilising reaction to impossible vigilance.  
The moral paradox: the very people charged with care must disengage to function.

### 3. Emotional Automation  
When humans burn out, software takes over.  
Escalation scripts and machine triage replace discernment.  
Algorithms don’t tire — but they also don’t empathise.  
Automation promises relief while entrenching fatigue by amplifying the noise floor.  
Decision fatigue becomes system architecture.

### 4. Restoring Meaningful Response  
Repair begins by re-introducing thresholds with purpose.  
- **Audit alert volume** — measure how many triggers yield action.  
- **Prioritise human review** over automated escalation.  
- **Integrate rest cycles** into governance design.  
- **Re-educate attention** through narrative, not alarm.  
Safety must feel believable to be functional.  
Silence is not neglect when it’s paired with discernment.

### 5. Shared Burnout Ecology  
False positive fatigue is collective:  
workers, survivors, and regulators occupy the same drained ecosystem.  
Each compensates for the other’s exhaustion until empathy debt becomes structural.  
Healing requires slowing the feedback loop — not moralising the exhaustion it causes.

*🪫 False Positive Fatigue — When Systems Over-Trigger* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It analyses how vigilance collapses into apathy when systems never sleep, tracing exhaustion as both human symptom and infrastructural flaw.  
This node forms part of *System Thresholds* within *System Governance*, completing the feedback triad with *Psychological Containment Loops* and *False Pretexts*.
