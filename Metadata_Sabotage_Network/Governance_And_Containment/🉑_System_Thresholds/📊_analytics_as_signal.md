# 📊 Analytics as Signal  
**First created:** 2025-09-29 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-29  
*Repo analytics as counter-surveillance evidence of uptake and visibility*

---

## 🔢 Numbers (last 14 days)  
- **4,998 views**  
- **48 unique visitors**  
- **1,917 clones**  
- **336 unique cloners**  

---

## 🧩 Interpretation  
- **Intensity not breadth:** A small number of unique visitors generating thousands of views → repeated, focused scrutiny.  
- **Cloning density:** ~6 clones per unique cloner → consistent with automated mirroring, institutional replication, or heavy testing.  
- **Containment inversion:** Attempts to silo survivor voice are undermined. Instead of scarcity, there is redundancy: dozens of live copies, hundreds of forking points.  
- **Annoyance factor:** For any actor who invested in locking material down, these numbers are an irritant. Control flips into exposure; surveillance into signal.

*Analytics as Signal* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how platform metrics themselves can become a refusal register — showing not fragility, but replication.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
