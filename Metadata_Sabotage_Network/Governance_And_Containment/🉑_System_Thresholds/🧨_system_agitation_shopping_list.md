# 🧨 System Agitation Shopping List  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-09  
*A catalogue of ordinary actions that containment systems interpret as volatility, divergence, or dissent.*

---

## ✨ Premise  
Surveillance logic cannot tell the difference between intention and anomaly.  
This list captures routine human behaviours that, when run through automated governance filters, register as threats.  
Each line item is a mirror: an index of where the system’s sense of “normal” ends.

## 🛒 Agitation Shopping List

- changing one’s preferred name more than once  
- writing emails at night in plain language  
- deleting an account without explanation  
- declining to install an “optional” update

- running spellcheck in another language  
- sharing a banned book as a teaching resource  
- saving local copies of meeting notes

- failing to use the organisation’s hashtag  
- speaking to the press without clearance  
- travelling without posting about it  
- refusing wellness questionnaires  
- sending files by USB rather than cloud share

*(Add freely. The list is open by design — agitation is cumulative.)*

## 🔥 Reading Instructions  
- Treat as a diagnostic aid for studying **threshold drift**: when the system’s idea of safety becomes self-referential.  
- When auditing containment algorithms, flag which of these behaviours are logged as anomalies or “risk signals.”  
- Use in training to test institutional empathy-response curves.

*System Agitation Shopping List* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It catalogues the everyday behaviours that automated containment systems misread as deviance or dissent.

Every bureaucracy keeps a secret list of “unapproved normal.”  

This one just publishes it.  

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
