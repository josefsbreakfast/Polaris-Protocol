*Making invisible criteria visible without creating new risk.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Every threshold system operates at the tension point between **visibility and vulnerability**.  
Full disclosure of trigger logic can invite gaming or manipulation, while total secrecy creates unaccountable power.  
This node defines the middle path: **forensic transparency** — revealing how systems decide, without revealing who they decide upon.  

Threshold disclosure is not about naming individuals, but about **auditing structures**.  
It transforms opacity from a governance feature into a measurable liability.

## 🔮 Disclosure Without Exposure  
The first rule of transparency is *do no harm*.  
Publishing full model parameters can expose people to exploitation or create new attack surfaces.  
Instead, institutions can disclose **threshold anatomy** — what categories exist, what types of data feed them, and what ethical rationale underpins each.  

Example:  
> “Eligibility threshold based on combined income and household composition.  
> Uses postcode-level data, not individual names.  
> Tuned annually to maintain parity with inflation.”

This kind of disclosure gives citizens a **map of decision logic** without handing over the coordinates of personal surveillance.  
It is transparency by design, not confession by compulsion.

## ⚖️ Legal Hooks for Transparency  
Transparency is not merely a policy preference; it can be legally grounded.  
Frameworks that can host threshold disclosure include:  
- **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)** — releasing anonymised decision criteria.  
- **Data Protection Act / GDPR Art. 15 & 22** — right to meaningful information about automated decisions.  
- **Public Sector Equality Duty** — requirement to demonstrate fairness in algorithmic outcomes.  
- **Public Contracts Regulations** — enforcing transparency on outsourced systems.  

These instruments can be harmonised through a **Forensic Disclosure Clause (FDC)**:  
a legal obligation for any entity using algorithmic thresholds to publish structured summaries of logic, weighting, and redress mechanisms.  

The FDC reframes secrecy as a compliance failure, not an operational norm.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Redaction Taxonomies  
Not all data is equal; not all transparency is safe.  
Disclosure frameworks require **graded visibility** — a taxonomy of what can be seen, by whom, and when.  

| Redaction Tier | Description | Typical Audience | Example Output |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1 — Public Summary** | Non-technical overview of criteria and purpose | Citizens, journalists | “Threshold considers age and address but excludes ethnicity.” |
| **Tier 2 — Professional Disclosure** | Aggregated data + parameter bands | Regulators, auditors | “Decision weightings: 0.4 location, 0.3 income, 0.3 age.” |
| **Tier 3 — Controlled Access** | Full algorithmic schema under NDA | Independent oversight panels | “Complete model code + live testing sandbox.” |

This taxonomy ensures proportional transparency: the public sees shape and rationale; auditors see logic and effect.

## 🩻 Citizen Oversight Models  
Disclosure becomes democratic only when **citizens can interpret it**.  
Oversight panels should therefore include not only experts, but lay participants drawn from communities most affected by thresholding.  

Possible structures:  
- **Citizen Data Juries** — rotating panels reviewing fairness evidence.  
- **Threshold Ombuds Offices** — independent mediators handling disputes about misclassification.  
- **Public Ledger of Adjustments** — open record of parameter changes and reasons.  

These models prevent “compliance theatre,” where agencies perform transparency without accountability.  
True disclosure allows correction — and builds trust through legible governance.

## 🐝 The Ethics of Controlled Openness  
There will always be moments when disclosure must pause: ongoing investigations, national security, personal safety.  
The ethical task is not to eliminate secrecy but to **label it**.  
Every redaction should carry a justification stamp:  
> “Redacted for personal privacy (GDPR Art. 5.1(c))”  
> “Temporarily withheld pending criminal proceedings.”  

When silence is annotated, it ceases to be deceit.  
This simple act transforms bureaucratic refusal into traceable accountability.  

Threshold disclosure, at its best, teaches governments to speak clearly even when they cannot speak completely.

*🧾 Threshold Disclosure Protocols — Forensic Transparency Tools* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It turns secrecy audits into instruments of accountability and reframes disclosure as a civic safeguard.  
Where *Threshold Literacy* teaches citizens to read triggers, this node teaches institutions how to show them responsibly.
