# 🉑 System Thresholds  
**First created:** 2025-09-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*On system thresholds, false pretexts, and escalation ladders within governance and containment frameworks*

---

## Purpose
To map the **invisible trigger points** built into bureaucracies, platforms, and surveillance regimes.  
This node studies how ordinary behaviours are measured against opaque criteria, how “false pretexts” are created to justify intervention, and how escalation ladders quietly transform care into control.

---

## Core Premise
Containment systems don’t act at random; they act at thresholds.  
Crossing a threshold can be as simple as an unusual login, a second name change, or a question in the wrong forum.  
These thresholds are rarely disclosed but heavily enforced, creating a self-reinforcing sense of risk and unpredictability for those living under scrutiny.

## Components of a Threshold System
| Layer | Function | Example Manifestations |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Trigger Indicators** | Behaviours, keywords, or metrics set as risk flags. | Multiple SARs; travel to flagged countries. |
| **Pretext Generation** | Framing neutral acts as suspicious to enable action. | “Pattern of concern” memos built from everyday activity. |
| **Escalation Ladder** | Stepwise intensification: monitoring → referral → enforcement. | Welfare → safeguarding → Prevent referral. |
| **Opaque Feedback** | Subject receives no notice or misleading reassurance. | “Routine check” letters concealing intelligence interest. |
| **Normalization of Drift** | Thresholds shift over time without notice. | New “best practice” updates lowering intervention bar. |

## Effects on Survivors
- **Chronic Self-Scrutiny:** internalising thresholds to avoid unknown triggers.  
- **Fragmented Citizenship:** living under multiple risk profiles across agencies.  
- **Escalation Anxiety:** never knowing when ordinary behaviour will become “non-compliant.”  
- **Consent Erosion:** feeling forced to share more data to prove innocence.  

---

## Analytical Questions
1. How are thresholds defined, and who sets them?  
2. What constitutes evidence for pretext generation?  
3. How are false positives handled, and what redress exists?  
4. How do thresholds drift downward over time (“mission creep”)?  
5. How can transparency be enforced without creating new risk categories?

## Research Threads
- FOI mapping of risk-flag triggers in public-sector systems.  
- Longitudinal study of escalation patterns across agencies.  
- Survivor diaries of “ordinary acts” flagged as suspicious.  
- Comparative analysis: credit-score thresholds vs safeguarding thresholds.  
- Reverse-engineering moderation thresholds on major platforms.

---

## Counter-Responses
- **Threshold Disclosure Demands:** statutory publication of trigger criteria.  
- **False Pretext Audits:** independent review of escalation case files.  
- **Refusal Protocols:** community-developed scripts for declining intrusive checks.  
- **Threshold Drift Monitoring:** version-control style logs of policy changes.  
- **Public Literacy:** teaching citizens how thresholds work without inducing paranoia.

*🉑 System Thresholds* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents one layer of metadata sabotage and its counter-responses—where the line keeps moving but the consequences remain.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
