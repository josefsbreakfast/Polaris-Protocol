# ⛴️ Stop the Boats, Trust the Bots

*How border theatre distracts from automated risk governance already in operation.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
“Stop the boats” operates as a loud, visual promise of control: borders, arrivals, exclusion.  
But the systems shaping **Prevent** do not arrive by sea.

They arrive upstream.

This node examines how attention is pulled toward migration spectacle while predictive, transatlantic data systems quietly classify, score, and shape people already inside the polity. The boats are debated in public. The bots are trusted in practice.

## 🧿 What the slogan hides  
The political focus on boats performs three kinds of displacement:

- **Spatial:** risk is framed as external and incoming, rather than domestic and embedded  
- **Moral:** scrutiny is placed on migrants, not on governance systems  
- **Causal:** harm is attributed to movement, not to modelling  

While the spectacle plays out, automated risk logic continues uninterrupted.

## 🧿 Why the bots don’t need boats  
Predictive governance does not require migration to import risk.  
It requires:
- language-common datasets  
- shared platforms  
- allied analytical norms  
- legitimacy laundering via expertise  

By the time Prevent ingests indicators or training logic, the provenance is abstracted. What matters is not where the person came from, but how legible they already are to data systems.

## 🏁 Core claim  
The slogan promises control at the border.  
The system exercises control far from it.

The boats are loud.  
The bots are decisive.
