# 🪖 Authoritarian Capture of Policing Institutions  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-23  
*Why police are an early and strategic target in authoritarian projects — and why this is deliberate, not accidental.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Across authoritarian, fascist, and totalitarian regimes, the capture of policing institutions occurs **early**, often before courts, media, or civil administration are fully reshaped.

This is not coincidence.

Police occupy a unique position at the junction of:
- lawful authority,
- everyday coercive power,
- and public legitimacy.

This node explains **why policing is systematically targeted**, how capture functions in practice, and why these dynamics persist even without explicit ideological takeover.

---

## 🪖 Why Police Are Targeted Early  

Authoritarian movements require three things to consolidate power:
1. **Control of force**
2. **Control of enforcement discretion**
3. **Erosion of neutral legitimacy**

Policing institutions provide all three.

Early capture allows movements to:
- neutralise internal resistance,
- shape enforcement priorities,
- and condition the public to accept coercion as normal or necessary.

Without policing capture, authoritarian power remains fragile.

## ⚖️ Dual-Use Capture: Instrument and Scapegoat  

Police are captured not only as an **instrument of power**, but also as a **sacrificial institution**.

### As Instrument  
Captured or pressured policing enables:
- selective enforcement against opponents,
- leniency toward aligned actors,
- intelligence access and surveillance leverage.

Even partial alignment is sufficient.

### As Scapegoat  
At the same time, policing is pushed into:
- legally ambiguous enforcement,
- politically unpopular actions,
- morally impossible positions.

Public trust erodes.

The movement can then claim:
> “The police are broken, politicised, or corrupt — only we can restore order.”

This dual-use dynamic is central to authoritarian consolidation.

## 🧠 Structural Vulnerabilities of Policing  

Policing institutions are especially capture-prone because they combine:

- **Discretionary authority** — wide latitude in daily decision-making  
- **Solidarity norms** — pressure to “back your own”  
- **Low transparency** — fragmented, situational work rarely fully audited  
- **Stress exposure** — chronic overload, trauma, and burnout  
- **Legitimacy pressure** — force must appear neutral while remaining coercive  

These are not flaws. They are structural realities.

Authoritarian actors exploit them deliberately.

---

## 🎯 Purposeful, Not Accidental  

It is a mistake to treat authoritarian drift in policing as:
- a personality problem,
- a training failure,
- or a series of “bad apples”.

What occurs instead is **strategic alignment**:
- external movements apply pressure,
- internal stress amplifies rigidity,
- oversight weakens under attrition,
- and enforcement quietly shifts.

No conspiracy is required.
Only sustained pressure and misaligned incentives.

The result is authoritarian *outcomes* even without universal authoritarian *intent*.

---

## 🧩 Key Insight  

Authoritarian capture of policing is not about turning officers into ideologues.

It is about ensuring that:
- neutral enforcement becomes impossible,
- legitimacy collapses,
- and coercive power remains available to those willing to claim it.

Police are targeted early because **everything else depends on them**.

*🪖 Authoritarian Capture of Policing Institutions* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It establishes the core analytical frame for understanding how coercive state institutions are strategically undermined and repurposed under authoritarian pressure.
