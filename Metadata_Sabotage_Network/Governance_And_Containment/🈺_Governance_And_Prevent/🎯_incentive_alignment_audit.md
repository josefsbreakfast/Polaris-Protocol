# 🎯 Incentive Alignment Audit  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-13  
*A diagnostic tool for identifying how incentives, metrics, and informal rewards shape behaviour under stress — often in opposition to stated values.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

Institutions do not run on values statements.  
They run on **incentives**.

This audit is designed to surface the gap between:
- what an institution claims to value, and
- what it actually rewards or punishes in practice.

In coercive institutions under stress, misaligned incentives are one of the fastest ways authoritarian outcomes emerge — without anyone explicitly choosing them.

---

## 🎯 What This Audit Examines  

This tool focuses on four interlocking questions:

1. What behaviour is *rewarded*?
2. What behaviour is *quietly punished*?
3. Where do KPIs fail to capture meaningful work?
4. How do competitive personalities respond under pressure?

Taken together, these reveal whether incentives are stabilising ethics — or eroding them.

---

## 🏆 Dimension 1: What Behaviour Is Rewarded  

Identify behaviours that reliably lead to:
- promotion,
- praise,
- desirable postings,
- informal status,
- career protection.

Common rewarded behaviours under drift conditions include:
- high arrest or stop volumes,
- visible “toughness”,
- speed over judgment,
- compliance without questioning,
- avoiding reputational risk for leadership.

**Signal:**  
If outcomes matter more than process, legality becomes secondary.

---

## 🧨 Dimension 2: What Behaviour Is Quietly Punished  

Look for behaviours that result in:
- stalled progression,
- isolation,
- increased scrutiny,
- informal warnings,
- reputational damage.

These often include:
- whistleblowing,
- de-escalation that contradicts expectations,
- community advocacy,
- raising legal or ethical concerns,
- slowing decisions to ensure proportionality.

**Signal:**  
Ethics are framed as inefficiency or disloyalty.

---

## 📊 Dimension 3: KPI vs Qualitative OKR Failures  

Assess whether performance measurement relies primarily on:
- crude quantitative KPIs (arrests, stops, outputs),
- rather than qualitative OKRs (judgment, restraint, learning).

KPI-heavy systems tend to:
- reward volume over quality,
- ignore harm prevention,
- punish time spent on complexity.

Under stress, this bias intensifies.

**Signal:**  
People compete on what is measured — not on what is right.

---

## 🧠 Dimension 4: Competitive Personalities Under Stress  

Policing and security institutions often attract:
- competitive,
- status-sensitive,
- risk-tolerant personalities.

This is not a flaw.

But incentives determine **what they compete on**.

Under misalignment, competition shifts toward:
- toughness,
- speed,
- dominance,
- visible control.

Under aligned systems, competition can reinforce:
- judgment,
- restraint,
- ethical consistency,
- peer trust.

**Signal:**  
Incentives decide whether competitiveness stabilises or destabilises governance.

---

## 🧩 Reading the Alignment  

An aligned system:
- rewards complexity,
- protects ethical friction,
- values learning under uncertainty,
- distributes risk fairly.

A misaligned system:
- rewards simplification,
- punishes dissent,
- externalises harm,
- accelerates authoritarian drift.

Incentives are architecture, not atmosphere.

---

## 🚨 Common Failure Pattern  

When institutions attempt reform without changing incentives:
- behaviour does not change,
- resentment grows,
- compliance becomes performative,
- backlash hardens.

This is why reform so often fails “despite good intentions”.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use This Audit  

- Map formal incentives (metrics, promotions).  
- Map informal incentives (status, protection).  
- Compare them to stated values.  
- Apply under *normal* and *high-stress* conditions.

If incentives and ethics diverge, ethics will lose.

*Incentive Alignment Audit* is a diagnostic tool within the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It provides a method for identifying how reward structures shape behaviour — and how misalignment accelerates ethical erosion under stress.
