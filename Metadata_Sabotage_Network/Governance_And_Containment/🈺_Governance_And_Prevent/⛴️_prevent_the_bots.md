# ⛴️ Prevent, the Bots, and the Boats  
**First created:** 2025-12-24 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-29  
*How transatlantic data trawling, automated analysis, and allied “risk logic” bleed into UK Prevent governance.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node examines a plausible—and largely unaccountable—pathway by which US-origin data collection and analysis (“the bots”) feeds into UK counter-extremism decision-making (“the boats”) under allied intelligence norms.  
It is not about a single programme or conspiracy. It is about **structural drift**: when predictive policing logic, platform surveillance, and think-tank mediation quietly reshape domestic governance.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Imported risk models and indicators  
- Cross-border OSINT and commercial data ingestion  
- Analytical laundering via think tanks and policy briefings  
- Diffuse accountability under allied intelligence cooperation

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. Imported epistemology  
UK **Prevent** borrows heavily from post-9/11 US counter-radicalisation frameworks: pre-crime indicators, behavioural proxies, and network adjacency over intent.  
The result is a system that *looks British* but *reasons American*.

### 2. Bots without borders  
US platforms, vendors, and research programmes collect data by language, topic, and network—not citizenship.  
British users embedded in transatlantic discourse are therefore **already present** in US datasets through:
- OSINT scraping  
- platform analytics  
- data brokerage  
- academic and policy research corpora  

No warrant is required because the data is framed as *open*, *commercial*, or *research*.

### 3. The boat crossing (analysis, not raw data)  
Direct surveillance of UK citizens is sensitive. Analytical products are not.  
Risk signals travel as:
- trend reports  
- briefings  
- “best practice” guidance  
- training material  

This allows allied sharing under **Five Eyes** norms without an obvious domestic decision point.

### 4. Think tanks as soft tissue  
Think tanks translate upstream analytics into policy-ready language.  
They:
- neutralise provenance (“evidence-based”)  
- abstract accountability  
- re-enter the UK system as expertise  

By the time guidance reaches local authorities, the origin is untraceable—and unquestionable.

### 5. Prevent as ingestion layer  
Prevent does not need to “spy” to be shaped.  
It only needs to:
- accept indicator sets  
- adopt training materials  
- trust allied framing  

The system becomes predictive without naming prediction, foreign without naming origin.

*⛴️ Prevent, the Bots, and the Boats* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how foreign-origin analytics can shape domestic counter-extremism practice through lawful but opaque pathways.
