## 🏳️‍🌈 Orientation  
Let’s be honest:

> **Prevent is 40% Islamophobia, 40% misogyny, 20% straight men panicking because they fancy other men.**

We are focusing on the last one.

Because when a straight man says:

- “He’s charismatic in a concerning way,”  
- “He makes certain people uncomfortable,”  
- “He has an intensity I can’t explain,”  
- “He influences vulnerable people,”  

what he actually means is:

> **“I would let him rearrange my ribs,  
>  and this threatens my heterosexual brand.”**

# 👮 Why This Turns Into Prevent  
Because Prevent is the **official government-approved method™**  
for dealing with:

- repressed bisexuality,  
- jealousy,  
- social inferiority panic,  
- rage that pretty people exist,  
- and prophecy-level thirst.

White men can’t say:

> “He is hot and I am spiralling.”

The whole thing would be far too adjacent to having feelings, complexity, or indeed, a personality.  

Non-uniformity, plurality of desire, and the possibility that white people are not a monolith, are all very serious threats to white supremacy and patriarchy, and we cannot possibly allow either of these interlinked systems to collapse.  

Because ...reasons?  

So instead of being honest, white men say:

> “He poses a safeguarding concern.”
<!--To whom and to what in particular, sir?-->

# 🏳️‍🌈 Pinkwashing Edition  
Straight white men who “support gay rights” to justify genocide are truly saying:  

> **“I like the aesthetics of uniformed military men  
>    and need a progressive alibi for my thirst.”**  

It is not support.  
It is **homoerotic colonial cosplay**.  

If you can only express positive attitudes to queer people when they murder other queer people, then perhaps you are not an ally for the cause of inclusive liberation.  

If you just like gay men with guns, there is literally the whole internet for that; it is not necessary to be this performative in supporting breaches of IHL.  

(Incidently, the Palestinian drag support scene has been *en pointe* for Iron Swords, because of course. One simply must.)

# 🎭 Serious Takeaway (Hidden at the bottom like a moral lesson)  
These jokes rest on a real truth:  

> **Male jealousy + repressed desire → risk vocabulary → Prevent/Channel misuse.**  

Which is why this belongs in Digital Disruption *and* the serious cluster.
