# 🈺 Prevent as Structural Marginalisation  
**First created:** 2025-12-12 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-12  
*How Prevent and RICU frameworks amplified distrust, racialisation, and community harm — and why securitisation cannot replace social infrastructure.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines Prevent and associated strategic‑communications frameworks (including RICU) as **structural marginalisation systems** rather than neutral safeguarding tools.

Rather than operating as discrete policies, Prevent‑style regimes function as *governance architectures* that reshape trust, civic participation, and community relations over time.

The central claim is simple:

> When social problems are securitised, harm is displaced rather than resolved.

## ✨ Key Features

* Population‑level risk framing applied unevenly
* Racialised and religiously coded vulnerability models
* Covert or opaque influence mechanisms
* Diffuse accountability across agencies and contractors
* Replacement of social infrastructure with security logic

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. Prevent as Architecture, Not Programme

Prevent is often discussed as a policy. In practice, it operates as an **ecosystem**:

* schools, universities, and healthcare settings
* local councils and community organisations
* police and safeguarding partnerships
* data‑sharing and referral pathways

This diffusion embeds security logic into everyday civic life.

---

### 2. Trust Erosion as Systemic Outcome

Where Prevent is active, communities report:

* fear of misinterpretation
* chilled political and religious expression
* withdrawal from public services
* reluctance to seek help

These effects are not implementation failures; they are **predictable outcomes** of securitisation in social spaces.

---

### 3. Racialisation Through Risk

Although formally identity‑neutral, Prevent risk indicators:

* correlate strongly with Muslim identity
* rely on cultural and political proxies
* reproduce collective suspicion

This transforms Muslimness from a protected characteristic into an implicit risk signal.

---

### 4. Substitution Failure

Prevent expanded during periods of austerity that simultaneously:

* cut youth services
* reduced mental‑health provision
* dismantled community centres
* weakened local authority capacity

Security programmes filled the vacuum left by **withdrawn social infrastructure**, but could not perform its function.

Surveillance is not care.

---

### 5. Feedback Into Harm Cycles

Prevent’s effects feed directly into:

* securitisation feedback loops
* suspect class governance
* social injury accumulation

The system generates the very alienation it claims to mitigate.

## 🏮 Footer

*🈺 Prevent as Structural Marginalisation* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how securitised prevention regimes reshape civic life, deepen marginalisation, and fail to substitute for social investment — producing long‑term harm under the guise of safety.
