# ❌ The “Nothing To Hide” Fallacy  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Critique of the common defence of identity systems: “if you’re not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to fear.”*

## 1. The claim  
- Used to justify state surveillance and ID cards.  
- Frames resistance as suspicious.  

---

## 2. The reality  
- **Unequal policing** — racial and sex discrimination amplified by ID checks.  
- **Marginalised groups** — disabled people, trauma survivors, migrants, refugees → new data insecurities.  
- **Institutional dependency** — worsens DWP reliance, barriers to housing, healthcare, work.

## 3. Cynical read  
- ID schemes are sold as “solutions” but actually produce **more problems**:  
  - More exposure.  
  - More exclusion.  
  - More cost.  
- What looks like simplification is often **a cynical rebrand of containment and control.**
