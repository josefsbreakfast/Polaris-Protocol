# ⚖️ Adaptive containment thresholds  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*How surveillance and containment systems behave non-linearly under pressure, shifting tactics to maintain balance until thresholds are reached.*  

---

## 1. Adaptive containment  
- Systems redistribute pressure when challenged: if resistance grows in one place, counter-measures intensify elsewhere.  
- Creates a see-saw or “load balancing” effect.  
- Not always centrally planned; emerges from overlapping bureaucracies, contracts, and incentives.  

---

## 2. Threshold behaviour  
- At low pressure → responses are predictable and linear.  
- At high pressure → compensations become chaotic, harder to read.  
- Eventually → system can no longer rebalance smoothly, leading to a new equilibrium or a snap.  

---

## 3. Human perception  
- From the inside, this feels like:  
  - Early stage: “I can map the rules.”  
  - Later stage: “The rules break down, responses look erratic.”  
- Non-linearity itself becomes a stressor, eroding trust and predictability.  

---

## 4. Polaris parallels  
- Mirrors **Le Châtelier’s principle** in chemistry: disturb equilibrium → system compensates.  
- Under heavy disturbance, the equilibrium collapses rather than balancing.
