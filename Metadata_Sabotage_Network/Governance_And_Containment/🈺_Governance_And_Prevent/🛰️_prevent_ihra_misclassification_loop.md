# 🛰️ Prevent / IHRA Misclassification Loop

**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14
*How Jewish distress and political clarity are re-routed into suspicion pipelines through combined Prevent and IHRA frameworks.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node maps a specific feedback loop operating within UK institutions where **Prevent counter-terrorism logic** and **IHRA-framed antisemitism guidance** interact to misclassify Jewish distress — particularly from anti-Zionist Jews — as a form of ideological risk.

Rather than safeguarding Jewish individuals, this loop redirects expressions of fear, anger, or political clarity into systems designed for surveillance and suspicion.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Emotional disclosure is reframed as ideological signal
* Political speech is treated as a risk marker
* Jewish identity does not confer protection from suspicion
* Prevent logic overrides care-based interpretation

---

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. Entry point: disclosure under stress

The loop typically begins when a Jewish person:

* reports harassment or threats
* expresses fear linked to political violence
* discusses Zionism, Israel, or Palestine in a care or institutional context
* articulates anti-occupation or international-law-based critique

In a safeguarding or mental health setting, this would ordinarily signal vulnerability.

---

### 2. IHRA keyword framing

When IHRA guidance is operationalised without contextual literacy:

* political critique is flattened into "antisemitism-adjacent" speech
* Jewish intra-community disagreement is erased
* keywords substitute for meaning

For Jewish speakers, this creates a paradox: the framework intended to protect Jews becomes a filter through which their speech is misread.

---

### 3. Prevent escalation logic

Once speech is misclassified as concerning:

* Prevent training encourages escalation
* uncertainty is treated as justification for referral
* staff are incentivised to prioritise institutional safety over individual care

The individual is no longer a person in distress, but a *potential vector of risk*.

---

### 4. Feedback amplification

The loop reinforces itself:

* referrals generate data suggesting "risk"
* increased scrutiny validates the original misinterpretation
* institutions cite rising incidents to justify more training

Jewish people become both the justification for, and the target of, the system.

---

### 5. Who is most affected

The loop disproportionately impacts:

* anti-Zionist Jews
* politically literate Jews
* Jews seeking mental health support
* Jews reporting harassment by Zionist or far-right actors

Protection is inverted into exposure.
