*Study of how repeated Cabinet reshuffles fractured responsibility and weakened delivery of the 2000s ID scheme.*  

---

## 1. Ministerial turnover  
- **Home Secretaries**: Blunkett → Clarke → Reid → Smith.  
- **Treasury**: Andy Burnham defended costs during his tenure.  
- No consistent political ownership across the programme.  

---

## 2. Consequences of churn  
- Responsibility blurred → weak accountability.  
- Delivery fragmented → technical incoherence.  
- Ministers inherited liabilities rather than shaping strategy.  

---

## 3. Lessons  
- Large IT systems require continuity of political stewardship.  
- Churn creates both delivery failure and space for vendor capture.
