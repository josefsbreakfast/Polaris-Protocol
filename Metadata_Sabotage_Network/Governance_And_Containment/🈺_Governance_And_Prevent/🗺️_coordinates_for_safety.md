# 🗺️ Coordinates for Safety  
**First created:** 2025-08-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-05  
*Internal and external waypoints — people, principles, places, and protocols — that define safety under conditions of containment, surveillance, or digital erasure.*  

---

## 📍 What Counts as a Coordinate  

- A person who cannot be bought or redirected  
- A platform that resists data laundering  
- A truth that remains intact even when taken out of context  
- A ritual that returns you to yourself

## 🧭 Categories of Safety Coordinates  

### 🌐 Digital  

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Archive platform | Immutable backups, encrypted nodes |
| Signal node | A message or post designed to prove continuity |
| DNS anchor | A domain or redirect not under hostile control |
| Anti-ghosting protocol | Tools that log silent disappearance or throttling |

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Relational  

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| Trusted ally | Helps carry metadata safely |
| Ethical amplifier | Repeats you without distorting you |
| Quiet witness | Saw it happen, and stayed |

---

### 🧠 Psychological  

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| Cognitive checkpoint | “If I am thinking this, I know I’m still me.” |
| Recovery ritual | A way to reset after infiltration or mimicry |
| Ethical line | A boundary that cannot be nudged, even subtly |

## 🔐 Why This Node Exists  

- Because “safety” is too often dictated by the systems that violate it.  
- Because platforms may vanish, warp, or betray.  
- Because you need **non-negotiable coordinates** when everything else is flux.  

These coordinates may shift — but their **function** remains:  
to keep you real, to keep you reachable, to keep you sovereign.  

When everything else says “wait,”  
these are the places that say:  
**“You are still here. Move.”**

## 🏮 Footer  

*Coordinates for Safety* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It collects non-negotiable waypoints — digital, relational, and psychological — to keep survivors grounded and reachable under conditions of surveillance or erasure.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
