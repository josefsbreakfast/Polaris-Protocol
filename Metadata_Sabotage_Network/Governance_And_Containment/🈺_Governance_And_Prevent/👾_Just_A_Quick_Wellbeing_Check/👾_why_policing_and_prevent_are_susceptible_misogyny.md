# 👾 Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Misogyny  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*How gendered assumptions, institutional culture, and behavioural-surveillance logic combine to make misogyny a persistent and predictable failure mode in both policing and PREVENT.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Misogyny in policing is not an aberration.  
It is a **structural feature** of institutions built on:

- hierarchical authority,  
- emotional suppression,  
- masculine-coded performance,  
- coercive power,  
- and suspicion-driven decision-making.

PREVENT inherits — and amplifies — all of these dynamics.

This node explains **why policing and PREVENT repeatedly harm women**,  
why they misinterpret women’s behaviour,  
and why misogyny persists even when individual staff believe they are gender-neutral.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- Identifies how policing culture encodes misogynistic norms.  
- Shows why women’s distress is misclassified as instability.  
- Explains the gendered assumptions baked into PREVENT risk logic.  
- Maps how complaint → punishment is gendered in practice.  
- Outlines the structural changes needed for gender-literate counter-extremism.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

# 1. **Policing Was Built Inside a Masculinised Institutional Culture**

Historically, policing in Britain developed around:

- male hierarchies,  
- command-and-control structures,  
- militarised discipline,  
- patriarchal moral authority,  
- suspicion of “emotionality,”  
- the idea that control = safety.

PREVENT — as an ideological extension of policing — inherits this cultural logic.

In a masculinised institutional culture:

### Women’s emotional expression = instability  
### Women’s anger = volatility  
### Women’s distress = risk  
### Women’s boundaries = hostility  
### Women’s fear = “overreaction”

This is not personal prejudice.  
It is **the gender of institutional power.**

---

# 2. **PREVENT’s Behavioural Logic Misreads Women’s Emotions**

PREVENT heavily relies on “behavioural cues”:

- tone changes,  
- withdrawal,  
- inconsistent communication,  
- increased emotion,  
- anxiety,  
- distress.

But in a gendered society, these behaviours are **differently interpreted** depending on sex.

### **Women’s distress → “instability”**  
Women expressing fear, burnout, or overwhelm are classified as:

- vulnerable,  
- volatile,  
- unpredictable,  
- “difficult to manage.”

### **Men’s distress → “pressure / stress”**  
Men in the same state are read as being:

- overburdened,  
- tired,  
- under strain.

Thus:

> The same behaviour produces opposite classifications depending on gender.

---

# 3. **Misogyny Amplifies Under PREVENT’s “Escalate Ambiguity” Rule**

PREVENT rewards over-interpretation:

- If you escalate something that turns out to be nothing → no punishment.  
- If you fail to escalate and “miss a sign” → high institutional fear.

This produces a predictable gendered pattern:

- Women’s distress is over-classified (just in case).  
- Women’s boundaries are over-interpreted as risk (just in case).  
- Women’s anger is pathologised (just in case).  
- Women’s withdrawal is escalated (just in case).

Misogyny becomes **operationally rational**.

---

# 4. **Complaint → Punishment Is More Severe for Women**

Women who:

- question authority,  
- raise concerns,  
- describe institutional harm,  
- use metaphorical language to explain abuse,  
- express fear of coercive dynamics,

are disproportionately labelled:

- unstable,  
- erratic,  
- hostile,  
- emotional,  
- grievance-driven,  
- “in need of safeguarding.”

This is especially acute for:

- women of colour,  
- Muslim women,  
- disabled women,  
- ND women,  
- working-class women.

In PREVENT, complaint is often reframed as:

> **evidence of vulnerability → susceptibility → risk.**

This gendered trap silences women and erases institutional accountability.

---

# 5. **Misogyny Intersects with Policing’s “Good Victim / Bad Victim” Logic**

Policing culture sustains a rigid distinction:

- “Good victims”: compliant, calm, unemotional  
- “Bad victims”: angry, traumatised, inconsistent, complex

PREVENT uses these same logics.

Women in distress — especially survivors of abuse — are often misclassified because their trauma responses resemble PREVENT “risk indicators”:

- panic → volatility  
- shutdown → withdrawal  
- fear → instability  
- self-advocacy → hostility  
- hypervigilance → ideological agitation

This is **institutionalised victim misinterpretation**.

---

# 6. **Gendered Biases Shape Who Is Seen as “Threatening”**

### **Men (especially white men from higher socioeconomic groups):**  
- more likely to be seen as “rational,”  
- less likely to be flagged,  
- more likely to have their extremism minimised as debate.

### **Women:**  
- less likely to be seen as ideologically serious,  
- more likely to be flagged for behavioural reasons,  
- more likely to be treated as emotionally unstable.

Paradoxically:

> **Women are flagged more for behaviour; men are flagged less for ideology.**

This is how violent male extremists are missed,  
while distressed women are over-surveilled.

---

# 7. **Misogyny Thrives Because PREVENT Cannot Name Institutional Harm**

PREVENT has no mechanism for:

- recognising gendered patterns of misclassification,  
- identifying institutional misogyny,  
- acknowledging sexist harm,  
- escalating concerns about discriminatory practice.

Therefore misogyny is **structurally invisible** to the system.

And what remains invisible cannot be corrected.

*Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Misogyny* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the gendered mechanisms through which women — particularly marginalised women — are misclassified, escalated, and harmed by behavioural-surveillance systems embedded in policing.
