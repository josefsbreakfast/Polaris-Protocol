# 👾 Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Pre-Genocide Stages of Violence  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*How counter-extremism and policing frameworks reproduce the early-stage warning signs identified in genocide scholarship — not because they “want” violence, but because their structural incentives mirror pre-genocidal governance patterns.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node does **not** claim that policing or PREVENT are genocidal.

It maps something more precise and academically grounded:

> **The structural features that make policing and PREVENT susceptible  
> to behaviours seen in *pre-genocide stages* across global historical cases.**

Genocide scholars (Lemkin → Stanton → Maynard → Straus → Harff)  
identify recurring early-stage patterns:

1. **Classification**  
2. **Symbolisation**  
3. **Discrimination**  
4. **Dehumanisation**  
5. **Organisation**  
6. **Polarisation**  
7. **Preparation**

These stages occur **before** mass violence  
and emerge from:

- fear-based governance,  
- identity surveillance,  
- targeted suspicion,  
- political capture,  
- suppression of dissent,  
- misuse of “protection” rhetoric.

Policing and PREVENT — as currently structured —  
contain **the same architectural vulnerabilities** that allow these early stages to take root.

This node explains why.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Shows how PREVENT mirrors early-stage genocide dynamics (classification → suppression).  
- Explains how “risk” categories reproduce political and identity-based distrust.  
- Maps how pre-genocidal rhetoric uses “protection” narratives identical to PREVENT’s.  
- Identifies drift patterns that widen the harm potential of state structures.  
- Clarifies why this susceptibility is structural, not intentional.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

# 1. **Classification: PREVENT Sorts People Into “Risk Identities”**

Genocide’s earliest stage is classification:  
> dividing society into “us” vs “them.”

PREVENT classifies through:

- “vulnerability,”  
- “susceptibility,”  
- “instability,”  
- “identity shift,”  
- “ideological drift,”  
- “concerning behaviour.”

These categories map disproportionately onto:

- Muslims,  
- Black communities,  
- ND and disabled people,  
- women,  
- working-class youth,  
- protesters,  
- students.

Classification becomes the **interpretive frame** for all future behaviour.

This mirrors early-stage warning signs:  
not because PREVENT is genocidal,  
but because it uses **identity as the unit of risk**.

---

# 2. **Symbolisation: Labels Become Social and Institutional Markers**

Once classified, individuals receive symbolic status:

- “at risk,”  
- “vulnerable,”  
- “unstable,”  
- “radicalising,”  
- “ideologically receptive.”

These symbols:

- travel across agencies,  
- enter metadata pools,  
- shape professional attitudes,  
- alter how distress is interpreted,  
- influence social interactions.

Symbolisation does not require badges or armbands.  
It occurs through **record**, **language**, and **narrative.**

Early warning signs of genocide often begin with symbolic segregations  
that PREVENT’s metadata structure unintentionally mimics.

---

# 3. **Discrimination: Behaviour Is Interpreted Differently for Different Groups**

Historically, pre-genocide discrimination appears in:

- unequal policing,  
- asymmetrical suspicion,  
- distorted interpretations of behaviour,  
- assumption of malice in marginalised groups.

PREVENT replicates these patterns:

- Muslim grief → “grievance ideology”  
- ND shutdown → “withdrawal”  
- disabled distress → “instability”  
- Jewish fear → “agitation”  
- Black anger → “volatility”  
- Palestinian solidarity → “extremism-adjacent”  
- elite right-wing rhetoric → “political discourse”

This is not genocide.  
But it is **pre-genocidal asymmetry in interpretation**,  
the same mechanism that allows later violence to be rationalised.

---

# 4. **Dehumanisation: Distress Is Treated as Instability, Not Humanity**

Dehumanisation in early stages involves:

- interpreting normal human reactions as pathology,  
- treating suffering as evidence,  
- viewing marginalised people as inherently unstable.

PREVENT’s behavioural model does this unintentionally:

- crying → volatility  
- fear → susceptibility  
- political anger → extremism  
- ND meltdown → threat  
- boundary-setting → hostility  
- trauma → risk behaviour  
- protest → “ideological drift”

This reframing creates **distance** between the institution and the distressed person.

Distance is the fuel of dehumanisation.

---

# 5. **Organisation: Multi-Agency Infrastructure Creates Harm Multipliers**

Early genocidal dynamics are not yet violent —  
they are **administrative**:

- multilevel bureaucracy,  
- interlinked surveillance,  
- confused responsibility,  
- shared classifications.

PREVENT’s multi-agency design mirrors this:

- schools,  
- universities,  
- NHS,  
- GPs,  
- councils,  
- social care,  
- police,  
- immigration.

Each layer adds:

- interpretation,  
- fear,  
- escalation,  
- opacity.

The result is **distributed power with no accountability**,  
a known precursor for pre-genocidal institutional harm.

---

# 6. **Polarisation: PREVENT Treats Dissent as Instability**

Polarisation in pre-genocide stages involves:

- pathologising dissent,  
- painting critics as dangerous,  
- treating protest as disorder,  
- conflating political expression with extremism.

PREVENT mechanically reproduces this by:

- misclassifying Palestine protestors,  
- treating criticism of the state as “grievance,”  
- interpreting justified fear as hostility,  
- escalating activists as ideological risks.

Polarisation emerges because the system cannot tolerate criticism.

This is a **classic early-stage warning sign** in genocide studies:  
institutions that react to criticism by escalating surveillance.

---

# 7. **Preparation: Expanded State Powers, Shrinking Dissent**

In later pre-genocide stages (NOT genocide itself), states typically:

- expand surveillance,  
- widen definitions of threat,  
- restrict protest,  
- intensify classification,  
- politicise policing,  
- use “protection” rhetoric,  
- use vague laws to suppress opposition.

PREVENT is vulnerable to this drift because its architecture is:

- elastic,  
- politically steerable,  
- fear-driven,  
- ambiguous by design.

Thus PREVENT can be — and already is — deployed against:

- genocide protestors,  
- anti-racist activists,  
- disabled women,  
- students,  
- unions.

Not because it intends harm,  
but because its architecture **cannot resist political misuse**.

---

# 8. **Why PREVENT Cannot Perceive Its Own Susceptibility**

PREVENT is structurally blind to early warning signs because:

### **1. It equates state authority with neutrality**  
Therefore cannot recognise oppressive state behaviour.

### **2. It interprets criticism as evidence of instability**  
Thus dismisses early warnings.

### **3. It lacks trauma literacy**  
Thus misreads distress as risk.

### **4. It holds no category for institutional harm**  
Thus cannot see itself as an actor.

### **5. It assumes “safeguarding is safety”**  
Thus ignores its own violence.

Systems that cannot critique themselves  
are more vulnerable to darker political capture.

PREVENT’s blindness is not malicious.  
It is architectural.

*Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Pre-Genocide Stages of Violence* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It traces how structural features — classification, behavioural surveillance, fear-based escalation, and political capture — can create environments similar to those described in early genocide scholarship, even without intent.
