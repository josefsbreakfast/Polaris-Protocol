# 👾 Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Ableism and Eugenics  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*Why counter-extremism and policing repeatedly misclassify disabled, neurodivergent, chronically ill, and mentally distressed people — and how this replicates historic eugenic logics even when no one intends it.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Ableism inside policing and PREVENT does not require:

- explicit hostility,  
- conscious prejudice,  
- bad actors,  
- discriminatory intent.

It arises from **structural design choices**, inherited from:

- eugenic public-health traditions,  
- institutional suspicion of deviation,  
- coercive medical frameworks,  
- psychiatric paternalism,  
- policing’s discomfort with unpredictable behaviour.

PREVENT is uniquely dangerous to disabled and ND people because its **behavioural indicators** overlap almost perfectly with:

- autistic distress,  
- ADHD overwhelm,  
- trauma shutdown,  
- sensory overload,  
- chronic illness fatigue,  
- dissociation,  
- grief responses,  
- cognitive disability.

This node maps why PREVENT is fundamentally vulnerable to ableism and eugenic drift — and why this produces measurable harm.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Explains how surveillance frameworks replicate eugenic assumptions.  
- Shows why ND communication and disability-related behaviours are misread as “instability.”  
- Maps PREVENT’s structural inability to distinguish distress from danger.  
- Identifies patterns where disabled people become targets rather than protected.  
- Outlines what non-eugenic counter-extremism would require.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

# 1. **Policing Historically Pathologises “Difference”**

UK policing has always been built around:

- predictability,  
- compliance,  
- visible normality,  
- “typical” affect,  
- consistent behaviour,  
- standardised communication.

This produces suspicion of anyone who:

- communicates atypically,  
- struggles with eye contact,  
- has emotional dysregulation,  
- appears withdrawn or overwhelmed,  
- reacts non-linearly to stress.

These traits appear *disruptive* to institutions  
because institutions are built around **neurotypical performance**.

PREVENT imports this epistemology directly.

# 2. **PREVENT’s “Behavioural Shifts” Map Directly Onto ND and Disabled Lived Experience**

The following PREVENT indicators all overlap with disability:

### PREVENT: “Withdrawal”  
→ ND shutdown, sensory overload, burnout, depression, chronic fatigue

### PREVENT: “Tone shift”  
→ autistic masking fatigue, ADHD exhaustion, trauma responses

### PREVENT: “New online networks”  
→ online disability/ND communities where in-person socialising is difficult

### PREVENT: “Identity shift”  
→ ND self-discovery, late diagnosis, coping adaptations

### PREVENT: “Emotional dysregulation”  
→ literally the diagnostic criteria for several neurodivergences and disabilities

### PREVENT: “Unusual contact”  
→ support seeking, sudden advocacy, disability-specific peer groups

Thus:

> **Disabled & ND traits appear indistinguishable from “pre-extremism markers.”**

This is a design flaw — not an accident.

# 3. **Eugenic Logic Survives Through “Risk-Based” Approaches**

Modern policing rejects explicit eugenics,  
but many **eugenic assumptions** remain embedded:

- unpredictability = danger  
- dependency = instability  
- distress = volatility  
- cognitive divergence = impaired judgement  
- chronic illness = unreliability  
- mental health crisis = risk  
- neurodivergence = behavioural concern  
- disability = vulnerability

These assumptions produce:

- over-surveillance of disabled people,  
- misclassification,  
- coercive safeguarding,  
- punitive interpretation of behaviour.

PREVENT magnifies this because it treats **deviation from the norm as threat**.

---

# 4. **Multi-Agency Drift Exposes Disabled People to Exponential Harm**

Disabled people interact with:

- GPs  
- specialists  
- mental health services  
- social care  
- universities  
- workplaces  
- disability support officers  
- welfare systems

Every contact is an opportunity for:

- misinterpretation,  
- escalation,  
- “concern” logging.

PREVENT then receives:

- a stack of biases,  
- each framed as “evidence,”  
- each amplifying the next.

The result is “multi-agency concern”  
even when nothing is wrong except being disabled in a non-disabled system.

---

# 5. **Complaint → Punishment Is Intensified By Ableism**

Disabled people who:

- describe institutional harm,  
- advocate for accommodations,  
- express frustration,  
- set boundaries,  
- withdraw from unsafe environments,  
- explain sensory overload,  
- become distressed by bureaucratic hostility,

are often labelled:

- problematic,  
- erratic,  
- grievance-driven,  
- unstable,  
- emotionally volatile.

PREVENT interprets this as:

> **“vulnerability → susceptibility → ideological risk.”**

Thus:

- disabled women → “unstable,”  
- ND students → “volatile,”  
- autistic adults → “rigid beliefs,”  
- traumatised people → “agitated,”  
- chronic illness sufferers → “withdrawn.”

Complaint becomes pathology.  
Distress becomes threat.

---

# 6. **Ableism Intersects With Every Other Susceptibility Category**

PREVENT cannot interpret:

- autistic communication → literalness mistaken for hostility  
- ADHD coping cycles → inconsistency mistaken for volatility  
- chronic pain fatigue → disengagement mistaken for suspicion  
- trauma → hypervigilance mistaken for grievance  
- disability isolation → “unusual withdrawal”  
- stimming → “agitation”  
- shutdown → “refusal to engage”  
- meltdown → “increasing extremism-related emotional volatility”  
- selective mutism → “non-cooperation”

This makes disabled people **uniquely vulnerable** to systematic misclassification.

---

# 7. **Eugenic Drift: When Disabled Lives Are Seen Primarily Through “Risk” Categories**

PREVENT’s entire model hinges on:

- risk,  
- stability,  
- behavioural predictability.

Disabled lives often require:

- flexibility,  
- adaptation,  
- irregularity,  
- fluctuation,  
- non-linearity.

PREVENT pathologises these at scale.

This is how you get:

- “concern” for autistic adults “because they isolate,”  
- escalation of ND distress as “threat,”  
- disabled activists flagged as “volatile,”  
- chronically ill students flagged as “withdrawn.”

This is **institutional eugenics through risk framing**.

---

# 8. **Why PREVENT Cannot Self-Identify Ableist or Eugenic Harm**

PREVENT has:

- no disability literacy requirement,  
- no ND competency framework,  
- no trauma-informed behavioural analysis,  
- no pathway for disabled people to challenge misclassification,  
- no mechanism to record institutional harm,  
- no recognition that systems oppress before individuals “radicalise.”

Thus, ableism is **invisible to PREVENT**,  
but disabled people are hyper-visible *to* PREVENT.

This is the architecture of eugenic drift.

*Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Ableism and Eugenics* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how behavioural-surveillance systems reproduce structural ableism and eugenic logic — not through malice, but through design choices that misclassify disability itself as risk.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
