# 👾 Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Antisemitism  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*Why antisemitic patterns recur in British policing and counter-extremism — not only through individual prejudice, but through institutional logics that repeatedly misread, ignore, or instrumentalise Jewish vulnerability.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Antisemitism in policing and PREVENT does not look like the older, explicit forms of hatred.  
It appears structurally, through patterns that include:

- indifference to Jewish vulnerability,  
- inconsistent protection from far-right threats,  
- misinterpretation of Jewish fear,  
- selective listening to certain Jewish voices over others,  
- using “antisemitism” as a political tool rather than a safety principle,  
- underestimating far-right fascination with antisemitic ideology.

This node maps how PREVENT and policing become susceptible to **both antisemitic neglect and antisemitic instrumentalisation**,  
which are two sides of the same structural failure.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Explains how British institutions historically under-protect Jewish communities.  
- Shows why PREVENT often misreads antisemitic risk signals.  
- Maps the political instrumentalisation of antisemitism in counter-extremism.  
- Identifies structural blind spots around far-right antisemitic ideology.  
- Outlines reforms needed for genuine protection of Jewish communities.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

# 1. **British Policing Has a Long History of Underestimating Antisemitic Threat**

Policing in the UK has historically:

- downplayed antisemitic violence,  
- treated Jewish fear as overreaction,  
- misread antisemitism as “generic hate,”  
- failed to recognise ideological antisemitism in fascist groups,  
- treated Jewish communal institutions as “self-contained,”  
- deprioritised Jewish safety compared to other threats.

This creates a structural baseline in which:

### **Jewish vulnerability is underestimated**  
### **Far-right antisemitism is miscategorised**  
### **Institutional confidence > lived experience**

PREVENT inherits this pattern.

# 2. **PREVENT Focuses on Muslim Communities While Far-Right Antisemitism Escalates**

PREVENT’s attention has, for decades, been skewed toward:

- Muslim communities,  
- Middle Eastern politics,  
- “Islamist radicalisation.”

This creates a risk budget distortion:

- the majority of lethal antisemitic ideology worldwide today comes from the far-right,  
- yet PREVENT disproportionately scrutinises communities **not** associated with this threat.

This is a structural misalignment that leaves Jewish communities under-protected.

---

# 3. **Antisemitism Is Misunderstood as Either Ancient or “Solved”**

Institutionally, there are two dominant misconceptions:

### **a) Antisemitism as ancient hatred**  
→ treated as historical, folkloric, not urgent.

### **b) Antisemitism as “solved” in modern Britain**  
→ because Jewish people are perceived as integrated and “successful.”

Both lead to minimising contemporary threats:

- conspiracy-theorist antisemitism,  
- Great Replacement rhetoric,  
- QAnon-adjacent ideology,  
- white nationalist “cultural Marxism” narratives,  
- attacks on Jewish schools/synagogues.

PREVENT is not structurally calibrated to detect these.

---

# 4. **The System Prefers Certain Jewish Voices and Ignores Others**

PREVENT’s institutional relationships often centre on:

- politically aligned Jewish organisations,  
- voices seen as “representative” or institutionally comfortable,  
- groups whose views align with policing expectations.

This contributes to:

### **1. Instrumentalisation**  
Antisemitism is amplified when useful to a political narrative.

### **2. Neglect**  
Jewish voices raising concerns about far-right antisemitism are deprioritised  
if their analysis clashes with PREVENT’s dominant ideological frame.

### **3. Erasure of Jewish left and Jewish minority voices**  
Jewish people critical of policing or state policy are often ignored,  
or reframed as “ideologically fringe.”

This is institutional antisemitism expressed through selective listening.

---

# 5. **Jewish Fear and Jewish Anger Are Misclassified by PREVENT**

Jewish communities often live with:

- historical trauma,  
- fear of fascism,  
- awareness of rising far-right threat,  
- intergenerational anxiety,  
- heightened vigilance.

PREVENT misreads these as:

- “grievance,”  
- “instability,”  
- “overreaction,”  
- “ideological agitation.”

Thus Jewish emotional responses to real danger  
become pathologised inside a system that thinks it understands “risk indicators.”

---

# 6. **Antisemitic Tropes Replicate Through Systemic Blind Spots, Not Overt Hatred**

PREVENT is vulnerable to subtle antisemitic tropes such as:

### **“Jews are safe”**  
→ ignores evidence of rising far-right antisemitism.

### **“Jewish people are politically influential”**  
→ leads to treating Jewish fears as political noise, not safety data.

### **“Antisemitism is rare now”**  
→ underestimates online radicalisation.

### **“Jews integrate well, so they aren’t vulnerable”**  
→ denies the lived reality of ongoing threat.

### **“Jews are white so racism doesn’t apply”**  
→ erases antisemitism in white-majority societies.

These tropes produce institutional deafness.

# 7. **PREVENT’s Concept of “Extremism” Under-detects Ideologies With Antisemitic Foundations**

Far-right ideologies rely heavily on antisemitic conspiracy theory:

- “globalist elites,”  
- “cultural Marxism,”  
- “Great Replacement,”  
- “deep state,”  
- “media cabal.”

PREVENT’s ideological frameworks are poorly equipped to:

- dissect these narratives,  
- detect their coded forms,  
- understand their memes,  
- recognise their recruitment patterns.

This leads to:

> **dangerous under-classification of real antisemitic extremist threats.**

---

# 8. **Complaint → Punishment Dynamics Affect Jewish Communities Too**

Jewish individuals who:

- express fear,  
- raise security concerns,  
- challenge institutional blind spots,  
- critique PREVENT’s misalignment,  
- point to under-policing of far-right risk,

may be labelled as:

- anxious,  
- grievance-driven,  
- overly political,  
- “sensitive,”  
- exaggerating risk.

This is an institutional form of antisemitism:
**not hatred, but disbelief.**

---

# 9. **Why PREVENT Cannot Self-Identify Antisemitic Patterns**

The system lacks:

- literacy in Jewish historical trauma,  
- nuance about ideological antisemitism,  
- mechanisms for understanding coded far-right narratives,  
- sensitivity to Jewish community diversity,  
- frameworks for protecting minorities outside dominant “terror” narratives.

Therefore PREVENT only sees:

- antisemitism that aligns with its existing worldview,  
not  
- antisemitism embedded in the far-right, police, or state.

This is why antisemitism persists in PREVENT **without anyone expressing overt prejudice**.

*Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Antisemitism* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps how antisemitic patterns emerge in counter-extremism not through explicit hatred, but through structural misalignment, selective listening, historical amnesia, and underestimation of far-right threat.
