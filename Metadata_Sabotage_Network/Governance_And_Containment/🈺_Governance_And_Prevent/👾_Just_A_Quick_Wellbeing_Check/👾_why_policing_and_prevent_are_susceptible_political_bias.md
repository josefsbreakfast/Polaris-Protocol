# 👾 Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Political Bias  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*How counter-extremism and policing architectures become instruments of political preference, reputational protection, and ideological framing — even when their practitioners believe they are “neutral.”*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
PREVENT and policing present themselves as politically neutral.  
Their formal documentation insists on:

- impartiality,  
- objectivity,  
- evidence-based decisions,  
- non-partisanship.

But in practice, political bias is **structurally embedded**, because these systems are:

- responsive to political pressure,  
- dependent on elite narratives,  
- shaped by media agenda-setting,  
- defined by ministers and senior civil servants,  
- sensitive to reputational risk,  
- incentivised to align with government priorities,  
- lacking independent oversight.

Political bias in PREVENT is not about “bad apples”.  
It is a **governance design flaw**.

This node explains why political bias is inevitable — unless explicitly designed against.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Maps how political narratives shape PREVENT’s definitions of “risk.”  
- Shows how governments redirect PREVENT toward their own agendas.  
- Explains bias toward policing certain communities and movements.  
- Identifies structural reasons PREVENT cannot be apolitical by default.  
- Outlines what would be required for genuinely non-partisan counter-extremism.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

# 1. **PREVENT Operates Within the Executive Branch — Not Independently of It**

Unlike courts or regulators, PREVENT is:

- not independent,  
- not insulated from political leadership,  
- not protected by statutory separation from ministers,  
- not governed by an arm’s-length impartial body.

It is embedded in the Home Office apparatus, which means:

### **Government priorities = PREVENT priorities.**

If ministers want to emphasise:

- one ideological threat,  
- one community,  
- one protest movement,  
- one foreign-policy conflict,

PREVENT’s framing shifts accordingly.

This is political bias by design, not by accident.

---

# 2. **Ambiguous Definitions Allow Political Steering**

PREVENT deals in vague terms:

- “extremism,”  
- “radicalisation,”  
- “ideological grievance,”  
- “susceptibility,”  
- “inflammatory rhetoric,”  
- “anti-democratic sentiment.”

These categories have no fixed definitions.

This ambiguity makes PREVENT **highly steerable**:

- the government broadens definitions → PREVENT broadens enforcement  
- the government narrows focus → PREVENT narrows referrals  
- ministers label a movement “dangerous” → PREVENT treats its members as risky  
- ministers defend a political ally → PREVENT downplays genuine threats from that group

Elastic categories = political capture.

# 3. **Policing Culture Already Views Dissent Through a Political Lens**

Policing has long been implicated in:

- suppressing miners’ strikes,  
- criminalising anti-racist protest,  
- infiltrating left-wing activism,  
- overlooking far-right violence,  
- over-policing Black communities,  
- treating poverty as suspicious,  
- treating middle-class activism as respectable,  
- protecting elite spaces.

PREVENT inherits this worldview.

Thus:

### **Left-coded dissent → risk**  
### **Right-coded dissent → “public order issue”**  
### **Far-right ideology → underplayed**  
### **Anti-racist movements → scrutinised**  
### **State-aligned rhetoric → normal**  
### **State criticism → destabilising**

This is political bias stitched into the operational fabric.

# 4. **Political Media Ecosystems Create PREVENT’s Threat Priorities**

PREVENT’s definition of “threat” does not originate in empirical data.

It originates in:

- newspapers,  
- ministers’ speeches,  
- policy briefs,  
- think tanks,  
- crisis narratives,  
- political advisors.

Media-driven panic → ministerial statement → PREVENT “priority”.

Examples:

- moral panic about “woke universities” → more university PREVENT activity  
- panic about Palestine protests → activists flagged as “extremism-adjacent”  
- panic about grooming gangs → racialised referrals  
- panic about climate protests → escalation of dissent as “anti-democratic”

The pipeline is political → not evidential.

---

# 5. **PREVENT Is Incentivised to Target the Groups With the Least Political Power**

PREVENT disproportionately surveils:

- students,  
- Muslims,  
- working-class youth,  
- disabled people,  
- ND individuals,  
- people of colour,  
- precarious staff,  
- migrants,  
- whistleblowers.

These groups have **low capacity to resist** misclassification.

Meanwhile, groups with political coverage:

- MPs,  
- newspaper editors,  
- senior police,  
- wealthy white men,  
- corporate elites,  
- politically powerful extremist networks,

are rarely flagged —  
even when their rhetoric is far more dangerous.

PREVENT enforces political hierarchy:  
**surveillance of the powerless, not the powerful.**

---

# 6. **PREVENT Cannot Recognise Its Own Political Bias Because It Equates State Policy With Neutrality**

PREVENT’s epistemology contains a core flaw:

> **“The state’s viewpoint is objective.”**

This means:

- criticism of the state → “grievance,”  
- opposition to government policy → “extremism-adjacent,”  
- activism around genocide, racism, or policing → ideological threat,  
- far-right political rhetoric → “concern but not extremism,”  
- elite political projects → categorised as “legitimate discourse.”

A system that equates “the state” with “neutrality”  
cannot perceive **state-aligned extremism**.

This is why:

- far-right ideology in elite institutions is under-detected,  
- Islamophobia is ignored,  
- racism is reframed as “cultural concern,”  
- transphobic narratives in politics go unmarked,  
- antisemitism is handled inconsistently.

---

# 7. **Political Bias Is Baked Into the Complaint-Punishment Cycle**

PREVENT treats:

- left-wing activism as “radicalising,”  
- anti-racist anger as “instability,”  
- Palestine activism as “extremism,”  
- climate protest as “anti-democratic.”

And treats:

- elite political anger as “debate,”  
- conservative ideology as “traditional values,”  
- far-right grievances as “public order issues.”

This is political bias masquerading as risk assessment.

---

# 8. **Political Bias Intensifies During National Crises**

In times of:

- war,  
- genocide protest,  
- economic instability,  
- mass dissent,  
- police scandal,  
- political challenge,

PREVENT contracts around government anxiety.

It becomes:

- defensive,  
- punitive,  
- narrow,  
- ideologically rigid.

This is why, during the Gaza crisis, peaceful protestors — including disabled women — were treated as potential extremists.

Crisis amplifies political capture.
