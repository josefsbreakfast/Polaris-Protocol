# 👾 Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Racism  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*The structural, historical, and operational reasons racism repeatedly reappears in UK policing and PREVENT — not as anomaly, but as design inheritance.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Racism within policing is not a mystery, nor an occasional scandal.  
It is a **structural vulnerability**: a predictable failure mode rooted in the history, culture, incentives, and epistemology of British state power.

PREVENT, as policing’s ideological offspring, inherits *every* one of these vulnerabilities.

This node explains **why** racism is reproduced — even by individuals who do not consider themselves racist — and why PREVENT cannot escape this pattern without explicit, foundational redesign.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Shows how policing’s historical role creates racialised assumptions.  
- Explains the risk categories that encode racism into PREVENT.  
- Maps the structural incentives that reward racial bias.  
- Identifies how “neutral” language disguises racialised outcomes.  
- Clarifies why racism is a system problem, not an intention problem.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

# 1. **The Colonial Inheritance: British Policing Was Born Racialised**  
Modern UK policing grows from colonial and imperial traditions:

- population surveillance,  
- racialised threat identification,  
- extraction of information from “suspect groups,”  
- classification of entire communities as “risky,”  
- hierarchies of civilisation vs. threat.

When PREVENT was invented, it did not start from scratch.  
It borrowed:

- language,  
- epistemology,  
- suspicion logic,  
- community categorisation,  
- and “protective” paternalism  

from policing’s colonial DNA.

Racialised suspicion is not a glitch — it is inheritance.

# 2. **Policing Uses Threat Models Built on Racialised Premises**  
PREVENT inherited several high-level assumptions:

### **a) “Risk” is more likely to come from racialised communities**  
This is never stated explicitly.  
It appears in:

- case studies,  
- training materials,  
- “community profiles,”  
- escalatory logic.

### **b) Whiteness is treated as the default ‘safe’ identity**  
So white extremists often appear “isolated,”  
while Muslim or Black men appear “patterned” or “ideological.”

### **c) Cultural unfamiliarity is treated as behavioural anomaly**  
Dress, language, mourning practices, religious expression  
→ misinterpreted as “shifts” or “radicalisation.”

This is how “neutral frameworks” produce racist outcomes.

---

# 3. **PREVENT Categorises Vulnerability in Racialised Ways**

PREVENT converts **stress**, **anger**, **grief**, **trauma**, and **identity negotiation** into “vulnerability indicators.”

For racialised people:

- ordinary grief → “withdrawal,”  
- political anger → “ideological grievance,”  
- fear → “instability,”  
- trauma → “susceptibility,”  
- faith → “identity shift.”

For white people:

- the same behaviours → “stress,” “burnout,” “overwhelm,” or “career pressure.”

This is not personal prejudice.  
It is **institutionalised racial coding** masquerading as clinical objectivity.

---

# 4. **Multi-Agency Systems Amplify Racial Bias Rather Than Correct It**

PREVENT’s multi-agency approach creates four amplification effects:

### **1. More eyes = more bias points**  
Every referral pathway imports its own racialised assumptions.

### **2. Consensus becomes confirmation**  
If multiple agencies make the same misinterpretation,  
it looks objective — even when racist.

### **3. Metadata becomes permanent racial suspicion**  
One misread moment becomes a lifelong interpretive frame.

### **4. No system exists to detect racialised harm**  
There is no escalation pathway called:  
**“This appears to be racism.”**

So racial bias can only move one direction:  
**forward**.

---

# 5. **Institutional Incentives Reward Racialised Suspicion**

PREVENT’s structure incentivises:

- early escalation,  
- erring on the side of suspicion,  
- over-classification of “unfamiliar” behaviour,  
- racialised assumptions about vulnerability,  
- fear-based decision-making.

There is **no reward** for accuracy, nuance, or anti-racist intervention.  
There is **massive punishment** for missing a “sign.”

Under this pressure, racial bias becomes **operationally rational**:

> “Better to refer someone who *looks* risky  
> than risk being blamed for missing something.”

Racialisation becomes a self-protective strategy.

---

# 6. **Complaint → Punishment Is Racialised Too**

When racialised people say:

- “This system feels racist,”  
- “I’m being misinterpreted,”  
- “I’m distressed by the process,”  

PREVENT’s architecture interprets the complaint as:

- instability,  
- grievance,  
- hostility to authority,  
- inability to regulate emotion.

Racism is transformed into **risk signal**,  
and the complainant becomes “difficult.”

This is how racist harm is perpetuated without racist intent.

---

# 7. **Why Racism Is Predictable in PREVENT**

PREVENT is susceptible to racism because it combines:

### **(a) policing DNA**  
Suspicion-first logic.

### **(b) behavioural surveillance**  
Tone and emotion read through cultural bias.

### **(c) paternalism**  
“We know what’s best for vulnerable communities.”

### **(d) opacity**  
No mechanisms for correction.

### **(e) anxiety**  
Fear of harm overrides accuracy.

Put together, this creates a perfect storm:

> **PREVENT will always misclassify racialised people  
more than white people unless explicitly rebuilt  
with anti-racism at its core.**

*Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Racism* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the structural mechanisms through which racism is reproduced inside counter-extremism and policing — not as personal prejudice, but as institutional design.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
