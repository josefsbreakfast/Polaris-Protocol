# 👾 Just A Quick Wellbeing Check  
**First created:** 2025-11-17  
**Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*You know the drill: we are just checking in with how you're getting on, because we've just had some concerns raised, and we just want to know you're doing okay. Now who lives with you? How many children do you have? What's your dog's name?*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
**👾 Just A Quick Wellbeing Check** is the home of Polaris nodes that analyse how benign-sounding institutional language — *wellbeing, concern, support, care, vulnerability, unusual behaviour, identity shift* — becomes the gateway to:

- scrutiny,  
- misinterpretation,  
- coercive escalation,  
- political drift,  
- policing of identity,  
- metadata amplification,  
- and pre-criminal risk construction.

This assumes that the majority of people in policing and in PREVENT systems would think these outcomes were bad, or at least unwanted outcomes.  

This subfolder focuses on the moments where institutions say **“we’re just checking in”**,  
but what they are actually doing is:

- classification,  
- risk inflation,  
- containment,  
- and behavioural surveillance.

This is where we map the **linguistic Trojan horses** of PREVENT logic.  

<!--Also, my gosh, you need to laugh at yourselves once in a while; we all do.-->

## ✨ What Lives in This Folder  
This subfolder contains:

- the full **👾 susceptibility series**,  
  examining why policing & PREVENT drift toward racism, Islamophobia, misogyny, political bias, authoritarianism, ableism, eugenics, antisemitism, fashion policing, etc.

- nodes on **symbolisation**,  
  **behavioural misinterpretation**,  
  **identity policing**,  
  **subtle coercion**,  
  **PREVENT drift**,  
  **metadata-based risk construction**,  
  and the governance dynamics that enable all of it.

- satirical, critical, and analytical pieces on  
  **institutional wellbeing-speak**,  
  **containment vocabularies**,  
  and **“just a quick chat” weaponisation**.

This subfolder captures the *dissonance* between:

> **the care language institutions use**,  
and  
> **the coercive architecture they enact.**

## 🧿 Scope & Structure  

### **Included Themes**
- PREVENT + policing susceptibility analyses (👾 series).  
- How “wellbeing” becomes a surveillance category.  
- Language drift from care → control.  
- Multi-agency misinterpretation pathways.  
- Behavioural surveillance & identity policing.  
- Political and cultural capture of “concern.”  
- Coercive care, compliant distress, system panic.

### **Excluded Themes**
Nodes focused on:

- high-level governance (🧭 Governance & Containment root),  
- overt psych-ops (🪆 Narrative Interference),  
- explicit data sabotage strategies (🧨 Disruption Kit),  
- token integrity auditing (🪙 TIA cluster),

should live elsewhere — but cross-linking is encouraged.

## 🔗 Constellations  
This subfolder connects to:

- **🧿 Metadata Sabotage Network**  
- **🪆 Narrative Interference**  
- **🧠 Behavioural Misinterpretation**  
- **🔥 Authoritarian Drift & Coercive Governance**  
- **✡️ Identity Policing & Symbolisation**  
- **♿ Disability Misclassification**  
- **🕌 Islamophobia & Racialised Threat Models**  
- **♻️ Protest, Dissent, & Escalation Dynamics**

Think of this folder as the **linguistic pressure point** in Polaris:  
where the institution *says one thing but means twelve others*.

## 🏮 Footer  
*👾 Just A Quick Wellbeing Check* is a subfolder of the Polaris Protocol.  
It examines how care language, risk logic, and identity policing fuse into governance tools that harm the people they claim to protect.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
