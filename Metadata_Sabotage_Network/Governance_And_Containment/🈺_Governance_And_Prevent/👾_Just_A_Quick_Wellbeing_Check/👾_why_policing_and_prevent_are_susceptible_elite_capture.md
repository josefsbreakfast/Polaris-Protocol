# 👾 Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Elite Capture  
**First created:** 2025-11-17 | **Last updated:** 2025-11-17  
*How counter-extremism and policing infrastructures, designed without democratic guardrails, are easily bent toward the priorities, fears, and narratives of political, economic, and institutional elites.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
“Elite capture” does not require conspiracy, corruption, or secret meetings.

It happens when:

- **institutions depend on elite-defined narratives**,  
- **elites set the terms of ‘risk’, ‘harm’, and ‘security’**,  
- **systems lack transparency and public accountability**,  
- **structural incentives align with protecting the powerful**,  
- **complaints from below are pathologised**,  
- **complaints from above are acted upon immediately.**

Policing and PREVENT are **structurally** vulnerable to elite capture because their architectures privilege:

- authority,  
- hierarchy,  
- safeguarding the powerful,  
- narrative control,  
- reputational protection,  
- containment of dissent.

This node explains why elite capture is not an aberration in PREVENT —  
but a predictable outcome of the way the system is built.

## ✨ Key Features  
- Defines elite capture as an architectural failure, not an allegation of corruption.  
- Shows how PREVENT’s risk logic defers to elite anxieties.  
- Explains why politically powerful actors can redirect counter-extremism.  
- Maps how dissent from marginalised groups is reclassified as instability.  
- Identifies what structural reforms are needed to resist capture.

## 🧿 Analysis / Content  

# 1. **Policing Has Always Been an Instrument of Protecting the Powerful**

Historically, British policing emerged to:

- control public disorder,  
- protect property,  
- maintain social hierarchy,  
- enforce class norms,  
- secure colonial interests,  
- preserve political legitimacy.

PREVENT inherits this orientation.

Even when individuals are well-intentioned,  
the culture of policing predisposes the system to serve:

- stability,  
- reputation,  
- elite anxieties,  
- state priorities.

This is the soil in which elite capture flourishes.

# 2. **PREVENT’s Ambiguity Makes It Easy to Steer From the Top**

PREVENT defines risk through:

- “vulnerability,”  
- “susceptibility,”  
- “grievance,”  
- “identity shift,”  
- “concerning behaviour.”

These categories are:

- **elastic**,  
- **politically malleable**,  
- **open to influence**,  
- **responsive to narrative**,  
- **dependent on context**,  
- **rarely challenged.**

This means elites don’t need to change PREVENT formally.  
They can **shift what counts as a “concern”** simply through:

- speeches,  
- media framing,  
- ministerial guidance,  
- public statements,  
- political pressure,  
- selective resourcing.

---

# 3. **Elite Narratives Define “Legitimate” vs “Illegitimate” Dissent**

The political class has disproportionate power to shape which grievances are seen as:

- “rational,”  
- “legitimate,”  
- “in-bounds,”  

and which are:

- “ideological,”  
- “concerning,”  
- “susceptible to extremism.”

Thus:

### **Middle-class anger → debate**  
### **Working-class anger → extremism**  
### **Elite anger → political discourse**  
### **Marginalised anger → radicalisation risk**

PREVENT then operationalises these hierarchies.

---

# 4. **Elite Capture Thrives Because PREVENT Operates Through Institutions That Already Serve the Elite**

PREVENT works inside:

- schools,  
- universities,  
- the NHS,  
- councils,  
- policing,  
- social care,  
- probation.

These institutions routinely:

- absorb elite pressure,  
- respond to political priorities,  
- manage reputational risk for the state,  
- avoid conflict with government.

When elites define dissent as “threat”  
(e.g., climate protest, anti-genocide protest, anti-racist protest),  
institutions downstream begin to treat dissenters as “risk individuals.”

PREVENT becomes the enforcement arm of elite anxiety.

---

# 5. **Elite Capture Is Strengthened by Institutional Fear**

Institutions fear:

- being blamed for missing a “sign,”  
- being called “soft on extremism,”  
- being criticised by ministers or the press,  
- losing funding,  
- being accused of enabling “radicalism,”  
- reputational harm.

So they over-escalate to show they are aligned with elite expectations.

This is how political pressure converts into operational behaviour.

---

# 6. **Marginalised People Cannot Capture PREVENT — But Elites Can**

PREVENT treats grievances voiced by the powerful as:

- legitimate concerns,  
- expressions of civic responsibility,  
- valid stressors.

It treats grievances voiced by the marginalised as:

- instability,  
- ideology,  
- susceptibility,  
- risk.

This asymmetry is the signature of elite capture.

---

# 7. **Elite Capture Becomes Visible When PREVENT Targets Protest Movements**

PREVENT’s susceptibility becomes clearest when elites perceive a political threat.

Examples include PREVENT being mobilised around:

- Palestine solidarity activism,  
- anti-racist organising,  
- climate movements,  
- anti-police violence protests,  
- anti-austerity activism.

These are movements challenging elite ideology or material interests.

Thus PREVENT’s framing shifts from:

> “prevent extremism”  
to  
> “contain political opposition.”

This is authoritarian drift **via** elite capture.

---

# 8. **Why PREVENT Cannot Self-Identify Elite Capture**

PREVENT cannot “see” elite capture because:

- It assumes neutrality.  
- It equates authority with objectivity.  
- It treats political elites as legitimate narrators.  
- It treats dissenting communities as suspect narrators.  
- It assumes institutional alignment = public interest.  
- It equates order with safety.  
- It denies institutional bias as a category of harm.

This epistemology **prevents the system from naming its own capture**.

*Why Policing and PREVENT Are Susceptible to Elite Capture* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It maps the structural dynamics through which political, economic, and institutional elites influence counter-extremism — not through conspiracy, but through the design of the system itself.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
