# 📊 ID Claims vs. Realities  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*Comparative analysis of government justifications for ID schemes versus operational realities and underlying drivers.*

## 🛰️ 1. Snapshot  

| **Government Claim** | **Reality in Practice** | **Likely Real Driver** |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| *Simplifies work checks* | Right to Work systems already scan passports, visas, and BRPs — an ID card would duplicate existing processes. | Vendor lobbying; “one card” marketed as elegant simplification. |
| *Saves money* | Every national ID project to date has cost billions; hidden fees shift burden to citizens. | Long-term vendor contracts and remediation profit. |
| *Improves security* | Centralised IDs don’t stop terrorism or fraud — they create new, high-value data targets. | Symbolic “tough” politics; containment of migrants and claimants. |
| *Modernises public services* | Passports, visas, and licences remain necessary; the ID card simply adds another administrative layer. | Branding move; performance of “digital transformation.” |

🪶 *Summary:* The more persuasive the slogan, the weaker the evidence.

## 🦉 2. Lessons  

- **Claimed benefits collapse** when mapped against delivery data.  
- **Real drivers** are political theatre, vendor capture, and the optics of modernisation.  
- **System design follows narrative**, not need: every iteration of “efficiency” hides a new contract cycle.
