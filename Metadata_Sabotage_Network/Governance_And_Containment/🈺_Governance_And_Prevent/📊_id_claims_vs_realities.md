## 1. Snapshot  

| **Government claim**       | **Reality in practice**                                            | **Likely real driver**                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplifies work checks      | Right to Work system already scans passports/visas/BRPs → ID card just duplicates. | Vendor lobbying; selling “one card” as neat solution.       |
| Saves money                 | Every ID scheme to date costs billions; costs shift to citizens via card fees. | Long-term vendor contracts and remediation profit.         |
| Improves security           | Centralised IDs don’t stop terrorism/fraud; they create new data targets. | Symbolic “tough” politics; containment of migrants/claimants. |
| Modernises public services  | People still need passports, visas, BRPs, licences → ID card is another layer. | Branding move: project of “digital transformation.”         |

## 2. Lessons  
- Claimed benefits collapse when mapped against reality.  
- Real drivers are political theatre and vendor capture, not operational need.
