*Analysis of contradictions in Blair-era policy: rhetoric of freedom and modernisation versus coercive biometric registry.*  

---

## 1. Rhetoric vs reality  
- **Public rhetoric**: “modernisation,” global freedom, fraud prevention, and security after 9/11.  
- **Reality**: coercive registry, centralised biometric collection, high cost, weak delivery.  

---

## 2. Hypocrisy strands  
- Claimed to defend *civil liberties* while mandating enrolment.  
- Framed as “choice” but linked to access to work, services, and visas.  
- Presented as an “entitlement card” but functioned as containment tool.  

---

## 3. Consequences  
- United unusual coalitions (civil libertarians, technologists, fiscal conservatives).  
- Undermined trust in government “modernisation” narratives.
