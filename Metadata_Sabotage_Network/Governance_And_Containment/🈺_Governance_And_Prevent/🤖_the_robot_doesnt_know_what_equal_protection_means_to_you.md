# 🤖 The Robot Doesn’t Know What Equal Protection Means to You  
**First created:** 2025-12-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-13  
*How abstract optimisation and proxy-based reasoning can fracture equality under the law without explicit discrimination*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node documents a governance risk that emerges when LLMs or algorithmic systems are used in contexts touching enforcement, access to services, regulatory action, or state decision-making: **the quiet erosion of equal protection through abstraction and proxy logic**.

Equal protection is not a statistical outcome.  
It is a legal and moral commitment.

The robot does not know what *equal protection* means to you.

---

## ⚖️ What Equal Protection Actually Means (Human View)

Equal protection means that:
- the law applies consistently  
- similar cases are treated similarly  
- differences in treatment are justified, proportionate, and reviewable  
- protected characteristics do not determine outcomes  
- the state does not arbitrarily favour or burden groups  

Humans understand this as:
- a safeguard against power  
- a constraint on convenience  
- a promise made especially to those with less leverage  

Machines understand only:
- pattern frequency  
- optimisation targets  
- proxy indicators  

---

## 🧠 The Failure Mode (Plainly Stated)

An LLM-assisted system is used to:
- prioritise cases  
- allocate resources  
- assess risk  
- recommend escalation  
- streamline decisions  

The system is not instructed to violate equality.

It is instructed to:
- be efficient  
- reduce workload  
- improve prediction  
- standardise outcomes  

Result:
**unequal treatment emerges from unequal inputs, unequal proxies, and unequal exposure — not unequal intent**.

---

## 🧩 How Equal Protection Erodes Without Anyone Removing It

### 1. Unequal Visibility  
Some groups:
- interact with institutions more often  
- are reported more frequently  
- generate more data  

Others remain under-documented.

The system treats *visibility* as *risk*.

Equal protection quietly collapses into **equal processing of unequal data**.

---

### 2. Proxy Substitution for Protected Characteristics  

Because protected characteristics cannot be used directly, systems rely on:
- location  
- network proximity  
- prior contact  
- service usage  
- linguistic markers  

These proxies often correlate strongly with:
- race  
- class  
- disability  
- immigration status  
- gender or sexuality  

The system does not know these correlations are legally sensitive.

---

### 3. Feedback Loop Amplification  

Once a group is:
- flagged more often  
- reviewed more frequently  
- escalated more quickly  

They generate more data.

More data produces more “evidence” of risk.

The loop reinforces itself while remaining procedurally neutral.

---

## ⚠️ Why This Is Hard to Detect Internally

From inside the institution:
- rules were followed  
- criteria were applied consistently  
- outputs were justified by data  

Disparity appears only:
- statistically  
- externally  
- over time  

And is often dismissed as:
> “reflecting underlying reality”

Rather than:
> **revealing biased system perception**.

---

## 🧯 Why “We Don’t Use Protected Characteristics” Is Not a Safeguard

Equal protection is not preserved simply by:
- excluding race, gender, or religion  
- avoiding explicit discrimination  

If proxies encode the same distinctions,
**the outcome is functionally identical**.

The robot does not understand:
- constitutional principles  
- historical discrimination  
- why some correlations are forbidden  

It only sees signal.

---

## 🧪 The Paracetamol Analogy (Again)

Each step appears defensible:
- data-driven prioritisation  
- objective risk scoring  
- consistent criteria  

But together they:
- stack disadvantage  
- shift burden onto the visible  
- harden inequality into procedure  

No one decides to violate equal protection.  
It dissolves through repetition.

---

## 🧠 Core Insight (In Plain Language)

Equal protection is not something an LLM can infer.

If you do not:
- explicitly encode it  
- actively test for its erosion  
- accept reduced efficiency to preserve it  

…the system will optimise it away.

Because equality is not the fastest path.

---

## 🧰 Minimum Safeguards (If Use Is Unavoidable)

Any deployment touching rights or access must include:

### 1. Disparity Monitoring  
Track outcomes by:
- protected and proxy groups  
- not just overall accuracy  

### 2. Proxy Sensitivity Audits  
Regularly test:
- which variables correlate with protected characteristics  
- what happens when they are removed  

### 3. Counterfactual Equality Testing  
Ask:
- “Would this decision differ if the subject belonged to another group?”  
- “Who benefits from this optimisation?”  

### 4. Explicit Equality Constraints  
Efficiency gains must be bounded by:
- legal equality requirements  
- not merely performance metrics  

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters for Democratic Legitimacy

Equal protection is the difference between:
- law and power  
- governance and domination  
- legitimacy and control  

Automation that erodes it:
- appears neutral  
- feels rational  
- and yet fractures trust  

Because people experience inequality directly,
long before systems detect it statistically.

---

## 🚨 Category Suppression: When “Likelihood of Conviction” Becomes Structural Injustice

A particularly severe manifestation of equal-protection failure occurs when algorithmic or LLM-assisted systems are asked — explicitly or implicitly — to optimise for **successful prosecution rates**.

This is often framed as:
- “resource efficiency”
- “avoiding weak cases”
- “improving conviction outcomes”
- “focusing on cases likely to succeed”

In certain categories of crime, this logic is catastrophic.

---

## ⚖️ Rape Prosecution as a Canonical Failure Case

Sexual violence cases are historically:
- under-reported  
- under-investigated  
- under-prosecuted  
- under-convicted  

This is not because the cases are weak, but because:
- evidentiary standards have been unevenly applied  
- juries have been biased  
- victims have been disbelieved  
- institutions have avoided reputational risk  

A human prosecutor understands this context.

A mathematical model does not.

---

## 🧠 What the Model “Learns”

If an LLM or statistical system is trained on historical outcomes and instructed to:
> “Prioritise cases likely to result in conviction”

It will infer:

- rape cases rarely lead to conviction  
- therefore rape cases are low-yield  
- therefore rape cases should be deprioritised  

Even when:
- evidence is strong  
- testimony is credible  
- the case would succeed before a jury  

The model is not sexist.  
It is **obedient to historical injustice**.

---

## 🔁 The Feedback Loop From Hell

Once this logic is operationalised:

1. Rape cases are deprioritised  
2. Fewer are prosecuted  
3. Conviction statistics worsen  
4. The model’s confidence increases  
5. Future cases are filtered earlier  

The system does not just reflect injustice.  
It **locks it in**.

This is how discrimination becomes *procedural*.

---

## ⚠️ Why This Looks “Rational” Internally

Inside an institution, this logic can appear:
- data-driven  
- neutral  
- fiscally responsible  
- performance-aligned  

Metrics improve:
- conviction rate rises  
- case backlog shrinks  
- “efficiency” increases  

Meanwhile:
- victims lose access to justice  
- deterrence collapses  
- public trust erodes  

The system is working.
Justice is not.

---

## 🧯 Why Humans Notice — and Models Don’t

Humans can say:
> “This category has been historically mistreated. We must over-correct.”

Models cannot do this unless explicitly instructed.

Absent constraints, they will always:
- optimise away difficult cases  
- favour historically successful categories  
- punish groups whose claims were previously ignored  

This is why **“likelihood of success” is an illegal proxy** in human justice — and a deadly one in automated systems.

---

## 🧪 This Is Not Hypothetical

This exact logic has already appeared in:
- predictive policing critiques  
- bail and sentencing algorithms  
- child protection risk scoring  
- benefits fraud detection  

Sexual violence prosecutions simply make the failure morally undeniable.

---

## 🧠 Core Insight (Bluntly)

If you ask a model to optimise for conviction,
**you are asking it to perpetuate past injustice**.

Equal protection requires:
- willingness to lose cases  
- tolerance of statistical inefficiency  
- commitment to rights over metrics  

Those are human values.
They do not emerge from data.

---

## 🧰 Non-Negotiable Guardrails

Any system touching prosecution decisions must:

- explicitly prohibit outcome-based suppression by crime category  
- decouple resource allocation from historical conviction rates  
- treat under-prosecuted crimes as *priority classes*, not low-yield ones  
- require human judgment where historical bias is known  

If this cannot be guaranteed,
the system must not be used.

---

## 🧭 Synthesis

LLMs will not say:
> “This category has been unfairly treated and deserves correction.”

They will say:
> “This category performs poorly. Allocate resources elsewhere.”

The robot doesn’t know what justice means.
It only knows what *worked before*.

And in cases like rape prosecution,
**what worked before was failure**.

*The Robot Doesn’t Know What Equal Protection Means to You* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how equality before the law can be undermined by proxy-based optimisation and abstraction without explicit discriminatory intent, and why equality must be treated as a hard constraint rather than an assumed outcome.
