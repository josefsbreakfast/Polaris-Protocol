# 💼 Industry Capture in Identity Systems  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-30  
*How major consultancies and tech vendors profit from failure, shape identity policy, and entrench state dependency.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node examines **industry capture** within state identity architectures —  
where private vendors define the problem, sell the solution,  
and retain control of both implementation and narrative.  

In digital identity ecosystems, this manifests as **corporate actors steering policy design**,  
embedding themselves as indispensable while evading accountability.  
What looks like reform is often **recursion disguised as modernisation** —  
the same firms, the same language of “transformation,”  
the same dependency rebadged as progress.  

---

## 👾 Capture Cycle  

1. **Pitch** — ID systems marketed as panaceas for fraud, migration, or “efficiency.”  
2. **Procurement** — multi-year contracts funnelled to a small circle of consultancies.  
3. **Failure** — exclusion, data breaches, cost spirals, system fatigue.  
4. **Remediation** — the same firms rehired to audit or “fix” what they built.  
5. **Persistence** — even after programme collapse, vendor infrastructure and lobbying pipelines remain.  

This is not malfunction.  
It is a **profit model based on recursion** — a self-sustaining loop of dependency.

## 🇬🇧 UK Case Context  

- The **2000s Identity Cards Programme** was championed by major IT contractors who later retained biometric and verification contracts.  
- When the programme collapsed, its infrastructure survived — rebranded under *digital identity* and *trust frameworks*.  
- Civil servants absorbed reputational damage; citizens inherited the risk.  

Across public-private “reform” cycles, failure is recycled as innovation —  
each collapse laying the groundwork for the next procurement wave.  

---

## 💰 Consequences  

- **Cost inflation** — billions spent on non-delivery and duplication.  
- **Policy distortion** — design driven by vendor capacity, not citizen need.  
- **Opaque infrastructure** — core systems outsourced yet politically unaccountable.  
- **Data persistence** — vendor-controlled codebases outlive the policies that authorised them.  

Capture turns **governance into dependency**, and **dependency into inertia**.  

---

## 🎁 Lessons  

- Vendor lock-in is not merely technical — it is political.  
- Without **independent engineering review** and **public-interest oversight**, “innovation” becomes an extractive loop.  
- Real reform begins with auditing who benefits from failure — and cutting the feed.

## 🦇 Counter-Capture Actions  

### 🎋 Policy Level — *Regain Public Control*  
- **Mandate publication** of all subcontractor chains for digital identity and verification systems.  
- Require **“exit-readiness audits”** — technical independence must be verified before contract renewal.  
- Establish a **Public Engineering Corps** within the civil service: long-term staff who can maintain, fork, or rebuild critical systems without vendor mediation.  
- Tie procurement evaluation to **data minimisation** and **citizen safety**, not to projected efficiency metrics.  
- Introduce a **statutory “cool-down”** on consultancy lobbying after failed or cancelled programmes.  

### 🌿 Community Level — *Civic Counter-Infrastructure*  
- Develop **community verification collectives**: libraries, local councils, or mutual aid networks trained to help residents verify data and contest exclusion.  
- Use **freedom of information tools** collectively — coordinated FOI or SAR campaigns to surface vendor dependencies.  
- Support **civic tech observatories** that map contract ecosystems, making revolving doors visible.  
- Partner with unions and professional bodies to build an **ethical procurement code** for public technologists.  

### 🌱 Individual Level — *Awareness and Resistance*  
- **Trace your data**: know which identity providers or verification layers store your records.  
- **Opt-out where possible** and document any denial of service following withdrawal.  
- Treat “user journeys” as **policy performance** — record friction, failure, or inconsistency and feed that back to watchdogs.  
- **Refuse fatalism**: the cycle depends on learned helplessness. Filing one evidence-rich complaint matters; each record interrupts the recursion.

## 🏮 Footer  

*💼 Industry Capture in Identity Systems* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how private contractors design, market, and sustain digital identity infrastructure through cycles of failure — embedding capture as governance norm — and proposes actionable routes for public re-control.
