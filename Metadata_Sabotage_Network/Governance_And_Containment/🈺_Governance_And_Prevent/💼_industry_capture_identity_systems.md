*How major consultancies and tech vendors profit from failure, shape identity policy, and entrench state dependency.*

## ✨ 1. Definition  

**Industry capture** occurs when private vendors define a public “problem,” sell the “solution,”  
and retain control of implementation and narrative.  
In digital identity ecosystems, this means **corporate actors steering state design** —  
embedding themselves as indispensable while avoiding accountability.

## 👾 2. Capture Cycle  

1. **Pitch** — ID systems sold as panaceas for fraud, migration, or “modernisation.”  
2. **Procurement** — multi-year contracts awarded to a handful of large consultancies.  
3. **Failure** — exclusion, technical flaws, data breaches, cost spirals.  
4. **Remediation** — same firms rehired to audit or “fix” the mess.  
5. **Persistence** — even after cancellation, vendor infrastructure and lobbying pipelines remain.  

This is not malfunction; it is a **profit model based on recursion**.

## 🇬🇧 3. UK Case Context  

- The **2000s ID Cards Programme** was championed by major IT contractors who later retained biometric and verification contracts.  
- When the programme collapsed, its infrastructure survived — rebranded under “digital identity” and “trust frameworks.”  
- Civil servants absorbed reputational damage; citizens inherited the risk.  

This mirrors other public-private “reforms”: **failure recycled as innovation.**  

---

## 💰 4. Consequences  

- **Cost inflation** — billions spent on non-delivery and duplication.  
- **Policy distortion** — design shaped by vendor capacity, not citizen need.  
- **Opaque infrastructure** — core systems outsourced yet politically unaccountable.  
- **Data persistence** — vendor-controlled codebases and databases outlive the policies that authorised them.  

Capture turns **governance into dependency**, and **dependency into policy inertia**.  

---

## 🎁 5. Lessons  

- Vendor lock-in is not technical; it is political.  
- Without **independent engineering review** and **public-interest oversight**, “innovation” becomes an extractive loop.  
- Real reform means auditing who benefits from failure — and cutting the feed.

*💼 Industry Capture in Identity Systems* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how private contractors design, market, and sustain digital identity infrastructure through cycles of failure, embedding capture as governance norm.
