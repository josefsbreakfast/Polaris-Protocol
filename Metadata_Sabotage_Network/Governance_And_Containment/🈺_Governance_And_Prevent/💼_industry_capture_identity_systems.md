# 💼 Industry capture in identity systems  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Analysis of how large consultancies and tech vendors promote identity systems, profit from failure, and capture government decision-making.*  

---

## 1. Definition  
**Industry capture** = when vendors frame identity systems as “solutions” to state problems, shaping procurement and policy while insulating themselves from accountability.  

---

## 2. Capture cycle  
1. **Pitch** — ID system marketed as panacea for fraud, migration, or “modernisation.”  
2. **Procurement** — awarded to large vendors on long-term contracts.  
3. **Failure** — cost spirals, technical flaws, exclusion harms.  
4. **Remediation** — same vendors hired again to “fix” problems.  
5. **Persistence** — even cancelled programmes leave vendor infrastructure and lobbying capacity intact.  

---

## 3. UK case context  
- ID cards (2000s) backed by major IT contractors.  
- Programme collapse did not prevent vendors from retaining biometric infrastructure contracts (e.g. passports, BRPs).  
- Government absorbed political fallout; citizens bore exclusion and data risk.  

---

## 4. Consequences  
- **Cost inflation** — billions spent on non-delivery.  
- **Policy distortion** — systems shaped by what vendors can sell, not by citizen need.  
- **Data risk** — vendor-controlled infrastructure persists beyond repeal.  

---

## 5. Lessons  
- Vendor lock-in is a governance failure.  
- Without independent technical oversight, “solutions” entrench state dependency.
