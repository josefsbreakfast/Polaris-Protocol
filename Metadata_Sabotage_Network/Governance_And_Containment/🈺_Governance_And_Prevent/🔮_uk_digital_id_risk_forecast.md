# 🔮 UK digital ID risk forecast  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Projection of risks if UK government revives a digital ID scheme, drawing on the 2000s precedent.*  

---

## 1. Zombie data by design  
Vendor test sets, temporary enrolment records, and inter-agency copies persist regardless of “destruction” orders.  

## 2. Twin profiles & shadow records  
Biometric mismatches generate duplicate identities. In UK’s fragmented databases, correction is costly and damaging.  

## 3. Migration “solution” myth  
- No evidence ID systems reduce irregular migration.  
- Risk of exclusion of lawful residents via data errors.  
- “No match” flags drive harassment and containment.  

## 4. Structural insecurity  
UK government IT estate: legacy creep + poor oversight. Adding centralised ID = single point of failure.  

## 5. Industry capture  
Big vendors profit from delivery + remediation. State carries political fallout. Citizens carry data risk.  

## 6. False simplification: the work check problem  
- **Current system** — Employers already use Home Office–approved software to scan passports, visas, and biometric residence permits (BRPs).  
- **Claimed benefit** — ID cards would “simplify” checks by providing a single document.  
- **Reality** — checks are already centralised and digital. Adding ID cards duplicates, rather than replaces, existing documents.  
- **Outcome** — more errors, more twin profiles, and higher cost for no operational gain.
