# 🔮 UK Digital ID Risk Forecast  
**First created:** 2025-09-26 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-26  
*Projection of risks if UK government revives a digital ID scheme, drawing on the 2000s precedent.*  

---

## 🧟 1. Zombie data by design  
Vendor test sets, temporary enrolment records, and inter-agency copies persist regardless of “destruction” orders.  

---

## 👥 2. Twin profiles & shadow records  
Biometric mismatches generate duplicate identities. In UK’s fragmented databases, correction is costly and damaging.  

---

## 🛂 3. Migration “solution” myth  
- No evidence ID systems reduce irregular migration.  
- Risk of exclusion of lawful residents via data errors.  
- “No match” flags drive harassment and containment.  

---

## 🏗️ 4. Structural insecurity  
UK government IT estate: legacy creep + poor oversight. Adding centralised ID = single point of failure.  

---

## 💼 5. Industry capture  
Big vendors profit from delivery + remediation. State carries political fallout. Citizens carry data risk.  

---

## 🛠️ 6. False simplification: the work check problem  
- **Current system** — Employers already use Home Office–approved software to scan passports, visas, and biometric residence permits (BRPs).  
- **Claimed benefit** — ID cards would “simplify” checks by providing a single document.  
- **Reality** — checks are already centralised and digital. Adding ID cards duplicates, rather than replaces, existing documents.  
- **Outcome** — more errors, more twin profiles, and higher cost for no operational gain.

## 😒 7. The “nothing to hide” fallacy  
- **Common claim**: “If you’re not doing anything wrong, you shouldn’t worry.”  
- **Reality**: ID systems expose *marginalised groups* to *greater harm*:  
  - Racial and sex discrimination in policing and service checks.  
  - Disabled people and trauma survivors flagged by mismatches or gaps.  
  - Migrants, refugees, and people with insecure status face double scrutiny.  
- **Systemic effect**: exacerbates DWP dependency, exclusion from housing, work, and healthcare.  
- **Cynical read**: ID cards are less a solution than a **new problem packaged as innovation**, sold by vendors and governments for political cover.

## 📊 8. Claimed benefits vs. reality vs. real drivers  

| **Government claim**       | **Reality in practice**                                            | **Likely real driver**                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplifies work checks      | Right to Work system already scans passports/visas/BRPs → ID card just duplicates. | Vendor lobbying; selling “one card” as neat solution.       |
| Saves money                 | Every ID scheme to date costs billions; costs shift to citizens via card fees. | Long-term vendor contracts and remediation profit.         |
| Improves security           | Centralised IDs don’t stop terrorism/fraud; they create new data targets. | Symbolic “tough” politics; containment of migrants/claimants. |
| Modernises public services  | People still need passports, visas, BRPs, licences → ID card is another layer. | Branding move: project of “digital transformation.”         |
