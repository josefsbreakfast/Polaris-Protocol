*Stub: how NDAs reshape memory landscapes and overwrite collective recall.*

---

## 🔍 Scope  

This node will explore how contractual silence doesn’t just suppress — it **colonises memory**.  
NDAs and settlement clauses reframe lived truth, erasing survivor recall and replacing it with institutional narrative.  

---

## 🧩 Draft Notes  

- NDAs as tools that overwrite testimony and seed doubt in memory.  
- Explore how suppressed memory loops into collective amnesia.  
- Potential constellation: *The Binding*, *The Book of Laughter and Forgetting*, truth commissions.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Contracts That Colonise Memory* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It will examine how contractual silence alters memory itself, embedding erasure as the new record.
