*Stub: economic analysis of how silence is valued, traded, and weaponised*

---

## 🔍 Scope  

This node will analyse the **economics of silence**.  
NDAs and gag clauses convert disclosure into financial instruments — silencing has a market price, and profit flows to those who enforce it.  

---

## 💰 Draft Notes  

- Payouts and settlements as commodified silence.  
- Reputation insurance via silencing.  
- Silence as a tradable asset in investment portfolios.  
- Constellation: *Never Let Me Go*, corporate crisis management, hush money scandals.

## 🏮 Footer  

*The Price of a Closed Mouth* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It will expose how silence is financially engineered and monetised, tracking the profit chains of erasure.
