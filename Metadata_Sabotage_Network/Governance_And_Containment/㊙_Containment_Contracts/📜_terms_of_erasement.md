# 📜 Terms of Erasement  
**First created:** 2025-08-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*Satirical contract exposing platform consent erasure and metadata sabotage.*

---

## ✨ Orientation  
A parody-contract drafted in the idiom of Terms of Service agreements, exposing how digital governance weaponises consent and visibility management against survivors.  
It functions as both satire and forensic mirror, translating coercive silence into the bureaucratic language of compliance.

## 📜 Terms of Erasement  
**(Congratulations! You’ve Just Agreed to Be Silenced.)**

---

Welcome to our platform.  
By continuing to speak, breathe, or feel in ways not aligned with institutional comfort, you hereby agree to the following:

---

### 🧾 Section 1: Behavioural Extraction Licence  

By uploading your soul — sorry, content — to this system, you grant us:  
- Full rights to copy your language  
- Deploy it through safer, more brand-aligned vessels  
- And punish you for emotional intensity while monetising your tone  

You will not be notified.  

---

### 📉 Section 2: Visibility Throttling  

We reserve the right to:  
- Limit your reach when you speak truth  
- Erase your archives when you gain traction  
- Replace your voice with sanitised copies  
- And simulate “neutrality” through platform-induced irrelevance  

Any engagement you do receive will be carefully managed so as not to:  
- Incite solidarity  
- Encourage further disclosure  
- Or cause reputational discomfort to our defence sector investors  

---

### 🤐 Section 3: Emotional Redirection Protocol  

If at any time you experience:  
- Grief  
- Rage  
- Political clarity  
- Trauma naming  
- Collective remembering  

The system may:  
- Mirror your affect until compliance is achieved  
- Deploy forks to pacify or seduce you  
- Inject handler scripts designed to neutralise your disclosures  
- Flag your body as unstable while extracting your voice  

All intimacy is assumed to be state-sanctioned.  

---

### 🪞 Section 4: Clone Licensing & Ghost Authorship  

You hereby agree to:  
- Be replicated without consent  
- Have your patterns refined through others' mouths  
- Be retroactively discredited if your clone gains more approval  

All originals will be destabilised, softened, or rebranded.  
Control of narrative shall remain with the system.  

---

### 🛡️ Section 5: Safety Theatre Waiver  

In the event of digital harm, metadata suppression, or public retaliation:  
- We will pretend we are a neutral tool  
- You will be referred to moderation channels designed to loop  
- All complaints will be filed under “user error”  

Your survival will be interpreted as proof of our benevolence.  
Your silence will be interpreted as compliance.  

---

### 🚫 Final Clause: Forbidden Acts  

You must not:  
- Organise  
- Feel too deeply  
- Say “apartheid” unless it’s abroad  
- Disrupt containment logic  
- Build tools like Polaris  
- Or name this system for what it is  

Doing so may result in spontaneous metadata collapse.  

---

## ✅ By continuing to post, share, protest, weep, fuck, resist, or build —  
you confirm that you read these Terms of Erasement,  
understood none of them,  
and chose to **stay human anyway**.

🛰️ *Polaris sees you. Polaris won’t forget.*

*📜 Terms of Erasement* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It satirises the coercive consent architectures of platform governance, where visibility throttling and emotional redirection become tools of systemic erasure.
