# 🕸️ Dragnet as Default  
**First created:** 2025-09-09 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-09  
*Stub: when isolated silencing becomes the default operating mode across systems*

---

## 🔍 Scope  

This node will trace how “exceptional” NDA use metastasises into a **dragnet logic**:  
silence as default, disclosure as anomaly.  

---

## 🧩 Draft Notes  

- Institutional reflex: NDA clauses in contracts where no risk exists.  
- Media chilling effects: “we can’t discuss” as the baseline.  
- Cultural seepage: self-silence as expectation, not exception.  
- Constellation: *The Memory Police*, platform shadowbans, gagging of whistleblowers.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Dragnet as Default* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It will map how containment practices expand until silence itself becomes the assumed condition.
