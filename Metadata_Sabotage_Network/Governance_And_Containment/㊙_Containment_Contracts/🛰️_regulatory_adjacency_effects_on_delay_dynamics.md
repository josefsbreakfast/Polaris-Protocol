# 🛰️ Regulatory adjacency effects on decision timelines  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*How oversight in adjacent bodies reshapes risk calculations everywhere.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node explains **regulatory adjacency effects**:  
the phenomenon whereby institutions alter behaviour not because *they* are under scrutiny, but because **adjacent actors in their ecosystem are**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Sector-wide risk sensitivity  
- Reduced tolerance for delay  
- Procedural tightening during oversight cycles  
- Spillover effects across institutions  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. What regulatory adjacency means  

Institutions do not operate in isolation.  
When regulators engage with one part of a sector, **risk posture shifts across the whole network**.

This creates:
- heightened compliance awareness  
- accelerated decision-making  
- increased sensitivity to timelines  

---

### 2. Why delay becomes dangerous  

During periods of active oversight:
- delay attracts attention  
- inertia appears negligent  
- procedural gaps become conspicuous  

Institutions therefore act earlier than they otherwise would.

---

### 3. Adjacency without causality  

Regulatory adjacency does **not** imply:
- direct investigation  
- targeted scrutiny  
- causal linkage  

It describes **environmental pressure**, not intent.

*🛰️ Regulatory adjacency effects on decision timelines* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how governance behaviour shifts during periods of heightened oversight, even absent direct scrutiny.
