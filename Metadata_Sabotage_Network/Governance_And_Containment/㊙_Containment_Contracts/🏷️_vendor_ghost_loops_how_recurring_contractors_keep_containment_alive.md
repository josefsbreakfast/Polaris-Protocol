# 🏷️ Vendor Ghost Loops — How Recurring Contractors Keep Containment Alive  
**First created:** 2025-11-11 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-08  
*The same ghosts, the same dashboards.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  

When the same vendors supply analytics or safeguarding platforms across multiple agencies, their architectures inherit and re-emit the same metadata ghosts.  
Each deployment appears new, but the fingerprints — API keys, schemas, linguistic defaults — remain identical.  
Containment becomes a **service franchise**.

## ⚙️ Loop Anatomy  

| Phase | Vendor Behaviour | System Effect | Containment Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1️⃣ Re-deployment** | Reuses legacy codebase. | Structural residue persists. | Old biases reborn. |
| **2️⃣ Cross-client replication** | Similar schema across councils / universities. | Shared ID logic. | Inter-agency ghosting. |
| **3️⃣ Data feedback** | Training on client data. | Contamination enters next model. | Echo amplification. |
| **4️⃣ Vendor persistence** | Same audit keys, same staff accounts. | Continuous signature. | Accountability diffusion. |

## 🪞 Governance Interpretation  

- **Vendor continuity = relational continuity.**  The ghost moves with the contract.  
- **Anonymisation cannot erase infrastructure identity.**  
- **Containment externalised:** data governance outsourced, but ghosts stay home.  

---

## 🧰 Oversight & Mitigation  

1. **Vendor lineage register** — log corporate and infrastructure genealogy.  
2. **Deployment fingerprint audit** — compare code and schema hashes across clients.  
3. **Cross-contract language review** — identify recycled descriptors and UI text.  
4. **Meta-vendor clause** — require disclosure of prior deployments in procurement.

*🏷️ Vendor Ghost Loops — How Recurring Contractors Keep Containment Alive* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It reveals how the same actors, systems, and schemas reproduce containment across institutions — ghosts under different letterheads.
