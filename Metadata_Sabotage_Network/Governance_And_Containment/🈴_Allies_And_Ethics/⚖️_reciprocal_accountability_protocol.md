# ⚖️ Reciprocal Accountability Protocol  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*A framework for two-way ethical review between survivors and allies.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This protocol defines what genuine ethical reciprocity requires: not moral symmetry, but the **refusal of extraction disguised as care**.  
In survivor–ally collaborations, power often leans toward those with institutional safety or reputational protection.  
Reciprocal accountability restores balance by building **mutual review loops**—so critique can circulate without collapse, punishment, or paternalism.  

It treats ethics as an ongoing relationship, not a compliance report.  
Its test is simple: can both sides be heard, changed, and still remain in relationship?

## 🔥 The Problem with One-Way Ethics  

Most institutional “listening” cultures are designed to **extract testimony rather than share power**.  
They collect survivor stories as moral capital—proof that ethics procedures exist—without creating structures that allow survivors to review or redirect the process.  

Within those hierarchies, emotional validation often substitutes for structural change.  
Institutions perform empathy as a managerial ritual: soothing witnesses while insulating systems.  
The exchange becomes one of **managed emotion**, not mutual accountability.  

By contrast, community-based environments tend to frame testimony as **relationship, not data**.  
Experience is held collectively rather than extracted individually; its purpose is transformation, not display.  
Expectations are explicit—what may shift, how soon, how securely—and the outcome is measurable in behaviour, not sentiment.  

Institutional ethics, however, often mistake composure for credibility.  
They pathologise emotion, treating volatility as risk and restraint as virtue.  
The result is a culture that prizes containment over repair.  
True accountability demands the opposite: an environment where grief, anger, humour, and renewal can coexist without sanction.  

The gap between **validation** and **transformation** is where trust dies.  
Reciprocal accountability begins there—by insisting that ethical hearing must produce structural motion, not theatrical empathy.

### 🏛️ Institutional Dishonesty and Performativity  

Extractive ethics are reinforced by the **professionalisation of survival**.  
Academia and allied institutions often position themselves as authorities on lived experience—publishing on trauma, survival sex work, or “resilience” while denying protection or credit to those whose lives underpin the knowledge.  

The contradiction is built into the architecture: professional identity depends on distance from experience.  
Those who have lived what is studied are encouraged to silence it, while those who haven’t are rewarded for analysis.  
This creates an epistemic loop where credibility belongs to the observer, not the participant.  

Reciprocal accountability calls that bluff.  
If institutions wish to speak in the name of experience, they must also become answerable to it:  
offering safety for disclosure, parity in authorship, and protection from retaliation.  

The same dishonesty operates in the broader landscape of “inclusive elitism”—organisations seeking the prestige of openness while maintaining selective belonging.  
The harm lies not in individual hypocrisy but in systemic dishonesty: a choreography of welcome that ends where truth begins.  
Reciprocal accountability treats this contradiction as diagnostic.  
It asks not who is being included, but **whose existence the structure can safely acknowledge without breaking character**.

## ➰ Designing Feedback Loops  

Ethical durability depends on friction — gentle, regular, built-in.  

| Mechanism | Function | Example |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Mirror Logs** | Shared reflections after meetings or drafts, completed by *both* survivor and ally. | “What did I miss? What did I over-control?” |
| **Consent to Critique** | Pre-agreed understanding that feedback is a form of care, not attack. | Statement embedded in project charter. |
| **Rotating Chair Model** | Each review session chaired by a different voice, including survivor participants. | Prevents hierarchy calcification. |
| **Red-Line Clauses** | Explicit boundaries defining retraumatisation or misuse. | “No surprise publication; no quote without re-consent.” |

Feedback here is **maintenance, not judgement**—the tuning of an ethical instrument rather than the filing of a complaint.

## 3️⃣ Protection Against Retaliation  

Accountability cannot survive fear.  
Therefore:

- **Decouple evaluation from funding:** critique must not jeopardise contracts or access.  
- **Enable anonymous channels:** use intermediaries or encrypted forms when needed.  
- **Guarantee a right to pause:** participation may be suspended without penalty.  
- **Maintain verbatim records:** document responses exactly, not interpretively.  

Retaliation is reframed as an **ethical breach**, not a misunderstanding.  
Its presence marks the failure of the system to practise the reciprocity it claims.

---

## 4️⃣ Renewal, Not Ruin  

The purpose of critique is repair.  

1. **Acknowledge receipt** — simple, dated statement of hearing.  
2. **Reflect publicly where safe** — demonstrate change without spectacle.  
3. **Adjust practice** — visible modification of policy, tone, or structure.  
4. **Archive the loop** — embed the lessons in institutional memory.  

Reciprocal accountability transforms feedback from exposure to evolution:  
from rupture → reflection → revision → record.  
Ethics ceases to be theatre and becomes infrastructure.
