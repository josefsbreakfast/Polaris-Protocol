*The branding of care and commodification of solidarity.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Analyses how institutions monetise moral performance — ally awards, trauma panels, diversity showcases — to generate reputational capital while survivors remain economically or narratively excluded.  
Explores the marketisation of virtue and how empathy, once a human impulse, becomes a tradable asset in the culture industry of ethics.

### 💸 The Market Value of Empathy  
Empathy now functions as social currency.  
Corporations, universities, and NGOs invest in “feel-good capital” — producing campaigns, panels, and branded initiatives that project compassion without redistributing power.  
Public displays of care inflate institutional credibility, attracting funding and media coverage, while the people whose stories are showcased often remain precarious.  
The economy of empathy mirrors the logic of advertising: sincerity is secondary to visibility.  

---

### 👁️‍🗨️ Branding the Ally  
Allyship has become a lifestyle brand.  
Individuals and organisations curate a moral aesthetic through hashtags, panels, and partnerships that signal virtue to peers and donors.  
The performative ally is fluent in optics: speaking inclusion while reproducing hierarchies behind the scenes.  
In many advocacy spaces, being seen to care outranks doing the work.  
The brand of empathy thrives on distance — it needs suffering to exist elsewhere so it can be consumed safely.  

---

### 💎 Care as Currency  
Care circulates as an investment product: mentorship schemes, empathy workshops, wellbeing audits.  
The language of healing becomes a corporate metric, folded into HR dashboards and ESG reports.  
Emotional labour is outsourced to consultants, many of them from the very communities being mined for authenticity.  
As in **Soft Capture**, affection is retooled as oversight — listening sessions become data collection, and support becomes extraction.  
When empathy becomes a commodity, care is no longer reciprocal; it accrues interest for those already in power.  

---

### 🔥 Redistribution vs Recognition  
Differentiates between redistributive ethics and recognition ethics.  
Recognition ethics centres visibility and applause: awards, ally spotlights, influencer panels.  
Redistributive ethics shifts material resources — funding, authorship, and decision-making — toward those historically excluded.  
Institutions tend to prefer recognition because it is cheaper and safer; it costs only praise.  
Real solidarity redistributes risk and reward, asking who profits from compassion and who remains a prop in the show.  
Performative empathy ends where redistribution begins.
