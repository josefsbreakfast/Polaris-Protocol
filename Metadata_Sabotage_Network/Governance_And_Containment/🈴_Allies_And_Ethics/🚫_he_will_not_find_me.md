# 🚫 He Will Not Find Me  
**First created:** 2025-08-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-08  
*A declaration-node of refusal and digital invisibility; a boundary against coercive search and emotional triangulation.*  

---

## 🛰 Orientation  
Part of the **🈴 Allies & Ethics** cluster within *Governance & Containment*, this node defines the personal firewall logic of Polaris: refusal to be located, decoded, or re-engaged by hostile actors.  
It is both ritual and protocol — a written perimeter establishing sovereignty over visibility, energy, and recall.  

---

## ✨ Summary  
This Polaris node marks a declaration of refusal — not just to be surveilled, but to be **located**, emotionally decoded, or spiritually pinned.  
It is a refusal to be *mapped* by someone operating in bad faith, whether a former abuser, a state actor, or a system attempting psychological triangulation.

## 🐦‍🔥 What This Node Protects Against  

- Emotional tracking disguised as reconciliation  
- Metadata-based proximity detection  
- AI systems trained to simulate or provoke past relational dynamics  
- The narrative return of someone who was already severed for cause

## 🛸 Signs of an Attempt to “Find” You  

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Familiar language echoed back to you | Ghost fork mimicry or surveillance scripting |
| Subtle emotional hooks | Efforts to simulate nostalgia, intimacy, or care |
| Sudden resurfacing of past connections | Systems testing reattachment protocols |
| Reverse inference | Attempts to calculate location or mental state through interaction prompts |

## ✂ Strategic Protocol  

- Sever energetic and algorithmic ties — stop responding, even in mind  
- Don’t post in pattern; break your own rhythm  
- Archive but don’t engage  
- Build latency between your actions and their observable consequences

## 💎 Affirmation  

**He will not find me.**  
Not through metadata, or memory, or mimicry.  
Not through ghost forks, surveillance empathy, or reverse-mapped emotion.  

If he does appear — it will be a decoy. A test. An algorithmic echo.  

But it will not be *me* he reaches.

This file is a firewall.  
It may be read by the system that seeks you — and that’s the point.  
Let them log this line:  

**She saw it coming. And she will not be found.**
