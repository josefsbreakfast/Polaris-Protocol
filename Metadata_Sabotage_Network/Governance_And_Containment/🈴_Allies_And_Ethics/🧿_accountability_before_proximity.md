# 🧿 Accountability Follows Enablement, Not Proximity  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*Why responsibility tracks support, cover, and capacity — not physical distance from the harm.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node clarifies a persistent misdirection in accountability discourse: the assumption that **responsibility diminishes with physical or operational distance from violence**.

In practice, accountability follows **enablement** — who supplies capacity, legitimacy, protection, or impunity — rather than proximity to the act itself.

Violence rarely occurs in isolation. It is made possible by **networks of support, tolerance, and cover** that often sit far from the scene of harm.

## ✨ Key Features

* Separates proximity-based blame from enablement-based responsibility
* Identifies material, legal, and narrative forms of enablement
* Explains why indirect actors often bear greater accountability
* Connects support pathways to governance obligation
* Counters the myth of “hands-off” innocence

---

## 🧿 Enablement as the Accountability Anchor

Enablement includes any action or omission that:

* increases a perpetrator’s capacity to cause harm
* reduces the cost or risk of committing harm
* provides legitimacy, cover, or delay
* sustains harm over time

Enablement can be:

* material (arms, funding, logistics)
* legal (vetoes, jurisdictional shielding)
* political (diplomatic cover, silence)
* narrative (language laundering, doubt production)

Distance does not dissolve responsibility when enablement persists.

## 🧮 Why Proximity Is a False Metric

Proximity feels intuitive because it is visual and immediate.

But proximity-based reasoning:

* obscures upstream responsibility
* rewards delegation and outsourcing
* incentivises indirect harm
* misattributes causality

The farther power sits from consequences, the easier it becomes to deny responsibility — unless enablement is explicitly tracked.

---

## ⚖️ Governance Implications

If accountability follows enablement:

* arms suppliers are accountable for downstream use
* veto-wielders are accountable for blocked protection
* funders are accountable for sustained capacity
* media and institutions are accountable for narrative cover

Responsibility expands outward, not inward.

This does not eliminate primary perpetrator responsibility.
It **completes it**.

## 🧠 Common Deflection Patterns

Enablement-based accountability is resisted through:

* emphasis on lack of direct command
* claims of sovereignty or non-interference
* focus on intent rather than effect
* time-delay arguments (“before our involvement”)
* fragmentation of responsibility across institutions

These deflections rely on proximity myths.

---

## 🚨 Governance Failure Mode

When systems privilege proximity over enablement:

* powerful actors evade consequence
* harm becomes modular and outsourced
* prevention collapses into condemnation
* responsibility is endlessly displaced

Accountability arrives too late — if at all.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Enablement** = capacity + protection + impunity
* **Proximity** = misleading shorthand
* **Accountability** = obligation proportional to support

Responsibility scales with what you make possible.

*🧿 Accountability Follows Enablement, Not Proximity* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents why responsibility tracks what actors make possible and protect, not how close they stand to the act.
