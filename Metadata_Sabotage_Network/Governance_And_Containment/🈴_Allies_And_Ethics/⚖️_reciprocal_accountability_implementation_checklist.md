# ⚖️ Reciprocal Accountability — Implementation Checklist  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-19  
*Operational companion for running the Reciprocal Accountability Protocol in practice.*  

---

## 🧭 Orientation  
This checklist converts the ethical framework into **repeatable field actions**.  
It ensures survivor–ally collaborations move from *principle to procedure* — practical, documentable, survivable.  
The goal: small, traceable acts of reciprocity that build ethical muscle memory across time.

---

## 1️⃣ Setup & Consent  

| Step | Action | Responsible | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1.1 | Draft and sign a **Reciprocal Accountability Charter** (1 page) confirming shared principles: honesty, repair, non-retaliation. | All parties | Keep a digital copy in project root. |
| 1.2 | Agree on a **feedback rhythm** — how often loops are run (e.g. every 2 weeks, post-meeting). | Lead & survivor | Frequency > intensity. |
| 1.3 | Define **communication safety zones** — what formats are acceptable for critique (voice call, text, written memo). | Survivor | Boundaries recorded, editable at any time. |

## 2️⃣ During Collaboration  

| Step | Action | Responsible | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| 2.1 | Complete **Mirror Logs** — both survivor and ally write 3 short reflection lines after each major exchange. | Both | “What felt true / what felt off / what could improve.” |
| 2.2 | Chair rotation — alternate who leads ethical review meetings. | Both | Prevents silent hierarchy. |
| 2.3 | Apply **Red-Line Clauses** — check no consent breach (publishing, quotes, reuse). | All participants | Breach = automatic pause pending review. |
| 2.4 | Run **Mini-Review** — 10-minute verbal loop summarising what changed since last reflection. | Ally initiates | Keep minutes or voice memo. |

## 3️⃣ Protection & Retaliation Safeguards  

| Step | Action | Responsible | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| 3.1 | Confirm that critique **cannot affect payment, access, or contract status**. | Institution / Ally | Include clause in agreement. |
| 3.2 | Offer anonymous feedback channel (trusted intermediary or encrypted form). | Ally | Optional but recommended. |
| 3.3 | Survivor may call **Pause** at any point; project halts with no penalty. | Survivor | Resume only after written mutual consent. |
| 3.4 | Record every response verbatim — no paraphrase. | Note-keeper | Keeps audit trail of tone & integrity. |

---

## 4️⃣ Renewal & Archive  

| Step | Action | Responsible | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| 4.1 | Conduct **Post-Loop Review** — summarise what changed because of critique. | Both | Use shared log template. |
| 4.2 | Publish (if safe) a **Learning Note** documenting what improved. | Ally / Organisation | Optional but culturally powerful. |
| 4.3 | Store all Mirror Logs & Reviews in a secure shared folder. | Admin | Encrypt if sensitive. |
| 4.4 | At project end, complete **“Ethics Loop Closed”** declaration — signed by both. | Both | Confirms process integrity. |

---

## 5️⃣ Annual Meta-Review (Optional)  

- Invite a peer or survivor-ally collective to audit the year’s loops.  
- Ask: *Did accountability travel both ways? Were repair processes real or rhetorical?*  
- Feed insights into next-year protocols.  

---

## 🧭 Implementation Notes  

- Keep it light: loops must fit real working lives.  
- Prioritise **traceable repair** over perfection.  
- Honest “we can’t fix this yet” is better than performative empathy.  
- Aim for **ethical muscle memory** — small, repeated acts of reciprocity.
