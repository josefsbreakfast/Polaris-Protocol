**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*The moral economy of suffering as social proof.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Interrogates how trauma hierarchies reward visible pain while penalising recovery, autonomy, or refusal.  
Critiques the transformation of suffering into a legitimacy token within advocacy, media, and research cultures.  
Asks how survivor credibility becomes dependent on continuous performance of distress rather than long-term wisdom or change.

### 💰 The Currency of Suffering  
Pain becomes a kind of proof-of-work in systems that claim to value lived experience.  
Survivors are encouraged to “cash in” their wounds for recognition, funding, or attention, but the exchange rate is cruel: authenticity is measured by anguish.  
Institutions translate agony into legitimacy tokens—testimony slots, media appearances, advisory roles—then convert those into credibility for themselves.  
The result is an emotional market where visibility outpaces healing, and grief must remain open to stay valuable.  

---

### 🌋 Trauma Hierarchies and Gatekeeping  
Maps how advocacy spaces stratify by depth of suffering.  
Those with the most spectacular wounds are elevated as emblems, while those who have stabilised or refused spectacle are sidelined as “difficult” or “not traumatised enough.”  
This ranking of pain replicates class, race, gender, and disability hierarchies: who is allowed to be fragile, who must stay stoic, whose recovery is suspect.  
Institutions reinforce these hierarchies because they generate compelling narratives for funding and public sympathy.  
Pain, in this system, is curated—an aesthetic of endurance that sustains organisational authority.  

---

### 👀 The Visibility Trap  
Visibility promises empowerment but often produces exposure instead.  
The survivor who speaks publicly becomes both advocate and object, rewarded for transparency until that openness ceases to serve the institutional story.  
Healing threatens the narrative economy: once pain lessens, funding and attention drift elsewhere.  
Digital platforms intensify this dynamic—algorithms privilege confessional tone, emotional extremes, and rapid disclosure.  
The economy of empathy becomes a spectacle of suffering, flattening complexity into shareable sentiment.  

---

### 🦢 Ethics Beyond Pain  
Proposes a different metric for legitimacy: integrity rather than injury.  
Refusal, recovery, and boundary-setting are not betrayals of authenticity—they are evidence of repair.  
Ethical witnessing means listening without demanding perpetual confession.  
Allies and researchers must learn to decouple compassion from consumption: to value knowledge born from endurance without requiring its constant reenactment.  
As in **Soft Capture**, care must not become currency; solidarity should restore privacy, not erode it.
