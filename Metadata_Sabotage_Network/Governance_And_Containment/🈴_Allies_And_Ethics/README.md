# 🈴 Allies & Ethics  
**First created:** 2025-09-06 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-10  
*Survivor ethics, relational alliances, and authorship sovereignty within systems of containment.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

The **Allies & Ethics** cluster defines how solidarity operates under surveillance.  
It studies the points where **help becomes hold**, where alliance transforms into soft containment, and where care reproduces the asymmetries it claims to oppose.  

This folder functions as the ethical spine of *Governance & Containment*: it translates lived survivor experience into **protocols for authorship, accountability, and refusal.**  
Together, these nodes offer a navigation system for ethical collaboration inside coercive environments.

## 🚀 Purpose  

To articulate **survivor ethics** in systems that reward performance of care while penalising autonomy.  
These nodes examine how relationships built in good faith can mutate into channels of surveillance, control, or reputational capture — and how to resist that transformation through clarity, consent, and self-authorship.  

---

## ⚖️ Core Premise  

Allies exist within systems that incentivise betrayal.  
Institutions reward proximity to survivors while discouraging accountability.  
Ethics here is not moral perfection but **constant calibration** — asking whether support sustains autonomy or quietly re-centralises power.  

---

## 🌌 Constellations  

🈴 ⚖️ 🤝 🪞 🧬 — ethics, reflection, reciprocity, distributed accountability, and refusal.  
These nodes form the relational-ethics constellation of *Governance & Containment*, bridging survivor voice fidelity with institutional accountability.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Allies & Ethics* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents how help can become harm if left unexamined — and how transparency, refusal, and reciprocity rebuild trust within coercive systems.
