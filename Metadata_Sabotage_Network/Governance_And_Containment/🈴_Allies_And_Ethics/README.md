# 🈴 Allies & Ethics  
**First created:** 2025-09-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Survivor ethics, relational alliances, and authorship sovereignty within systems of containment*

---

## Purpose
To define how solidarity operates under surveillance.  
This node studies **the ethics of alliance**—how relationships formed in good faith can still reproduce control when structured through hierarchy, pity, or institutional dependency.  
It establishes principles for ethical collaboration, citation, and co-authorship in spaces where trust is repeatedly broken by design.

---

## Core Premise
Allies exist within systems that incentivise betrayal.  
Institutions reward proximity to survivors while discouraging accountability.  
Ethics here is not moral perfection but **constant calibration**: asking whether support sustains autonomy or quietly re-centralises power.

## Ethical Fault Lines
| Dynamic | Risk | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Proxy Representation** | Voice Capture | Speaking *for* rather than *with* survivors. |
| **Visibility Bargains** | Tokenism | Using survivor presence as evidence of reform. |
| **Resource Gatekeeping** | Control | Allies mediating access to funding or legitimacy. |
| **Moral Exhaustion** | Withdrawal | Emotional burnout mistaken for neutrality. |
| **Containment Through Care** | Infantilisation | Framing protection as permission-granting. |

## Principles of Survivor Ethics
1. **Authorship Sovereignty:** survivors retain control of narrative framing and consent for reuse.  
2. **Transparency of Motive:** declare why an alliance exists and who benefits.  
3. **Reciprocal Accountability:** critique flows both directions without retaliation.  
4. **Refusal as Right:** survivors may end collaboration without moral penalty.  
5. **Redistribution, Not Recognition:** move resources, not spotlight.  

---

## Practice Guidelines
- Use **co-drafted statements** rather than third-person testimonials.  
- Attribute *labour* as well as *insight* in all publications or presentations.  
- Design exit ramps: time-limited commitments with review points.  
- Avoid saviour framing (“giving voice”); survivors already have voice—share the mic, not the message.  
- Document consent at every reuse of story, quote, or dataset.  

---

## Analytical Questions
1. What institutional structures reward ally performance over ally labour?  
2. How do citation patterns reproduce containment hierarchies?  
3. What does “ethical withdrawal” look like when safety and solidarity conflict?  
4. How can survivor networks govern themselves without mirroring carceral oversight?  
5. What language replaces “allyship” when mutual risk is shared?

## Research Threads
- Mapping of allyship economies within advocacy sectors.  
- Comparative study of survivor-led versus institution-led ethics codes.  
- Ethnography of trust repair following public betrayals.  
- Legal exploration: ownership and consent in collaborative research.  
- Development of *refusal protocols* as legitimate scholarly outputs.

## Future Expansion
This node underpins and connects to:  
- **🤝 Held by Other People’s Alliances** — dependency and conditional legitimacy.  
- **🕯 Exorcising Safeguarding Shadows** — moral language as containment.  
- **🛠️ Survivor Tools** — practical methods for sustaining autonomy.  
- **⚖️ Legal Templates & Guides** — consent and IP frameworks for survivor authorship.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
