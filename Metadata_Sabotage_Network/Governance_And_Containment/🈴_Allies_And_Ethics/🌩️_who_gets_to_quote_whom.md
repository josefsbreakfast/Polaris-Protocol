### 📣 Citation as Control  
Shows how referencing can operate as a containment device rather than a bridge.  
Certain institutions, editors, and funders determine which names “count” as credible, creating a cycle where marginalised voices must first be filtered through sanctioned interpreters.  
Citation becomes an act of permission rather than respect.  
This hierarchy is reinforced by academic SEO: citation algorithms on databases like JSTOR or PubMed reward dense interlinking among established papers, so scholars are trained to cite the already-visible.

### 🧠 Intellectual Extraction  
Examines how survivor and community networks are mined for intellectual and emotional labour while institutions reap the rewards.  
Academics, NGOs, and think tanks frequently “observe” or “document” survivor organising, converting that proximity into social and financial capital.  
The gains—citations, grants, career advancement—far exceed anything that returns to the networks whose insight and risk made the work possible.  
In many cases, institutions don’t even reciprocate in kind: no material support, no funding redistribution, no shared credit.  
Their gestures toward restitution—token acknowledgements, diversity statements, unpaid advisory panels—function as moral whitewash.  

This extractive dynamic mirrors colonial anthropology: the fieldworker arriving to collect stories, data, and rituals, exporting them for imperial policy design.  
The same pattern now replays in humanitarian and academic circuits, where lived experience is stripped of context and repackaged as “evidence” to justify managerial interventions.  
The result is a cycle of dispossession: community knowledge becomes raw material for institutional legitimacy, while the communities themselves are left depleted.  

As theorists in **Crip Theory** and texts such as **_Care Work_** (Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, 2018) note, community-based mutual aid consistently outperforms formal systems in sustaining life and dignity—yet it remains chronically under-resourced because governments and funders privilege institutional hierarchy over reciprocal infrastructure.  
Extraction is therefore not an accident but a design feature of capitalism’s colonial inheritance.  
Modern capitalism was engineered through carceral slavery and imperial expansion; its continuance depends on finding new populations deemed less than fully human, whose knowledge and labour can be converted into market value without recognition.  
Ableism, racism, sexism, and homophobia serve as the moral scaffolding for this economy of theft.  
Each hierarchy rationalises why some voices can be cited and others can be silenced.

### 🪼 The Temporarily Able-Bodied (TAB) Illusion  
Introduces the concept of **TAB — Temporarily Able-Bodied** — and why disability justice is everyone’s concern.  
Disability is the only marginalised category that any person can join at any moment, through illness, accident, or age.  
A single event can shift someone from social normality to exclusion, revealing how fragile the illusion of independence truly is.  

The term *temporarily able-bodied* exposes a truth that capitalism and empire both deny: our bodies are finite, contingent, and interdependent.  
Able-bodied status is not a permanent identity but a privilege on loan, sustained by infrastructure built for the comfort of the currently non-disabled.  
To become disabled within capitalist hierarchy is to discover how completely one’s worth has been tethered to productivity and perceived normality.  

Because disability intersects with every other axis of oppression, it reveals their entanglement.  
Marginalised groups already experience higher rates of disablement through environmental harm, medical neglect, workplace precarity, and violence.  
Women, queer people, and racialised communities are statistically more likely to become disabled precisely because systems of care were never built for them.  
Thus, to fight ableism is to fight racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism together.  

The TAB illusion is comforting but dangerous: it lets the currently comfortable imagine that inequality will never touch them.  
But it will.  
A slip, a crash, a diagnosis, a genetic lottery — and the hierarchy that once protected you becomes a weapon turned inward.  
For this reason, building accessible and equitable systems is not charity. It is self-preservation, solidarity, and foresight.

### 📙 Legitimacy Through Reference  
Unpacks how prestige networks use citation chains to launder legitimacy.  
Within academia, “showing lineage” through familiar names is treated as methodological rigour—but it also functions as a sorting device.  
High-brow versus low-brow citation norms reward proximity to canonical authors while punishing references that originate from community media, activist archives, oral testimony, or alternative formats such as speeches and videos.  
Students and early-career researchers are routinely marked down for citing these sources, even when they are the most direct or truthful.  

The justification is framed as *professionalism*; in practice it is gatekeeping, deeply entangled with classism, ableism, and white supremacy.  
Accessible and multimodal knowledge is treated as suspect because it threatens the authority of print-centric, institutionally archived discourse.  

This dynamic is dissected powerfully in **_Academic Ableism: Disability and Higher Education_** by **Jay T. Dolmage** (University of Michigan Press, 2017; 254 pp, ISBN 9780472053711).  
Part of the *Corporealities: Discourses of Disability* series, it exposes how higher education’s architecture, publishing norms, and citation hierarchies are built to exclude disabled scholars.  
Audio and ePub editions extend its accessibility—a fitting counterpoint to the print-based elitism it critiques.  
As Dolmage shows, such exclusionary infrastructure doesn’t just harm those denied recognition—it diminishes collective knowledge itself by filtering out embodied and disabled perspectives that reveal the limits of “objective” scholarship.  
Legitimacy, under these rules, is less about accuracy and more about accent.

### 🐇 Ethics of Citation and Redistribution  
Takes the rabbit as a metaphor for redistribution: quick, fertile, and disruptive to monoculture.  
When the British brought rabbits to Australia for sport, they multiplied uncontrollably and remade the landscape.  
In citation culture, that kind of rapid spread can be a good thing—if what we are redistributing is credit, not erasure.  

In the digital commons, sharing without attribution is one of the quietest forms of extraction.  
People with even modest followings can materially change an artist’s life simply by naming them.  
A single credit line can lead to commissions, sales, or visibility that sustains their practice.  
Credit is not just courtesy—it is redistribution in action.  

All art borrows.  
Humans are mimetic creatures; we learn through copying, remixing, and recombining.  
But when we name our sources, we restore lineage and visibility to the people whose work nourished ours.  
Acknowledging influence is not self-effacement—it’s ecosystem care.  
Those who cite, credit, and platform others become nodes of abundance: multipliers of resilience within the creative network.  

> 🪶 **If you don’t know the source:** check first.  
> Reverse-image search for artwork, paste a line of text or poetry into a search engine in quotation marks, or trace the earliest repost you can find.  
> Even partial credit—“via @username” or “quoted from X, origin unknown”—is better than silence.  
> About half the time, you’ll locate an earlier source; every small act of tracing restores a link in the chain.  

It’s curious how many professional systems still punish collective credit.  
Job interviews, funding bids, and publication metrics often force individuals to say *I did this* rather than *we built this*.  
That insistence on individual genius is not neutral; it’s a residue of white-supremacist and colonial mythmaking.  
The lone explorer conquering ruins is still the archetype, even when the ruins were destroyed by his own extraction.  
Real progress comes from the opposite impulse—the willingness to say *they were brilliant*, *we did this together*, *here’s who made it possible*.  

Ethical citation is therefore a survival skill, not a nicety.  
It redistributes attention, visibility, and income.  
It teaches us to breed generosity as quickly as rabbits—until the ecosystem itself begins to heal.
