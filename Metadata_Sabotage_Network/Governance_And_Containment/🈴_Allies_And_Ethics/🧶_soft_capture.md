# 🧶 Soft Capture — The Intimacy of Oversight  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*When closeness and care become instruments of control.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Explores relational capture: mentorships, care structures, and “support” roles that blur into soft surveillance.  
Asks how intimacy is weaponised to normalise observation and compliance, especially within institutional ethics frameworks that claim to protect.

### ✨ Definition: Intimacy  
Intimacy is a **neutral** condition—it simply describes closeness or proximity, not goodness or harm.  
It can nurture trust and care, or it can enable dependency, control, and invasion.  
As **Alice Wong** notes in *Disability Intimacy* (2022), disabled life often entails enforced closeness: daily assistance, clinical care, or bureaucratic oversight that brings others into one’s private sphere whether or not one consents.  
Intimacy therefore cannot be assumed to mean affection; sometimes it is a logistical reality or a structural imposition.  
Understanding this neutrality is essential before analysing how care can become containment.  

---

### 🦠 The Affective State Apparatus  
Examines how institutions cultivate emotional bonds to secure obedience.  
Through the language of compassion, mentorship, and “wellbeing,” bureaucratic systems embed themselves within private life.  
This is governance via empathy: an apparatus that thrives on feelings of gratitude, duty, and guilt.  
The result is an internalised form of control where affection replaces coercion but produces the same containment.  

---

### 🪩 Oversight by Friendship  
Interrogates the role of social and professional friendship in maintaining soft power.  
Peer relationships become channels of observation—where “checking in” shades into checking up.  
The friendly intermediary, often unpaid or precarious, becomes both emissary and enforcer.  
Survivors and whistleblowers experience this as emotional gaslighting: care that comes with strings attached, trust conditioned on compliance.  
Soft capture depends on plausible deniability; no one is officially watching, yet everyone feels watched.  

---

### 🔮 Emotional Surveillance Infrastructure  
Describes the digital and bureaucratic tools that quantify care.  
Feedback forms, wellness apps, and safeguarding portals transform feelings into metrics, feeding dashboards of institutional virtue.  
Algorithms interpret silence as wellbeing, engagement as consent.  
The infrastructure of oversight is increasingly affective—recording tone, sentiment, or “vulnerability indicators”—under the banner of support.  
The effect is a form of intimacy datafication: the colonisation of emotional space by compliance logic.  

---

### 🐉 Reclaiming Safe Distance  
Proposes refusal through boundary restoration.  
Safe distance is not coldness but sovereignty—the ability to decide when and how to be known.  
Reclaiming distance involves naming overreach, declining false intimacy, and designing care models that don’t require surveillance.  
Allies and mentors can practise “ethical detachment”: care without capture, solidarity without supervision.  
Soft capture unravels when proximity is rebuilt on consent, clarity, and reciprocity rather than institutional loyalty.
