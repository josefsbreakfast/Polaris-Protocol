# 🧊 The Care Cage  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*When “protection” becomes a form of imprisonment.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Dissects safeguarding, pastoral care, and moral oversight frameworks that infantilise or disempower survivors.  
Maps how the rhetoric of protection masks withdrawal of agency.  
Asks how risk management masquerades as compassion, and how “care” becomes a gate through which only the compliant may pass.

### 🪬 The Language of Safety  
Safety is the most persuasive moral currency in governance.  
Invoked as absolute good, it becomes unchallengeable—no one wants to appear anti-safety.  
Yet in many institutions, *safety* means the minimisation of institutional risk, not human flourishing.  
Policies promising to “keep people safe” often translate into surveillance, censorship, or exclusion of those deemed disruptive.  
The semantics of protection conceal asymmetry: the powerful define danger, while the vulnerable are defined by it.  

---

### 🐣 Infantilisation as Governance  
Traces how protective logic positions survivors as permanent minors—grateful recipients of oversight rather than autonomous agents.  
Forms, welfare checks, and “support plans” often strip adults of decision-making power under the guise of care.  
Dependency is framed as stability; compliance as wellbeing.  
This infantilisation justifies paternal control: “We know what’s best for you.”  
It is a slow erosion of dignity masquerading as kindness.  
Within the care cage, resistance reads as pathology.  

---

### 🧬 Moral Containment Loops  
Safeguarding infrastructures evolve into self-referential moral loops.  
Every new failure generates another layer of procedure, each one claiming to fix the previous oversight.  
But the loop never ends, because prevention becomes a performance in itself.  
Compliance audits replace empathy; documentation stands in for dialogue.  
The system reproduces harm by continuously protecting itself from accountability.  
Like other carceral architectures, it transforms moral responsibility into administrative theatre.  

---

### 🧄 Counter-Care and Survivor Autonomy  
Proposes *counter-care*—models of support grounded in consent, transparency, and mutual accountability rather than supervision.  
Counter-care treats survivors as co-designers of safety, not subjects of it.  
It favours open contracts over hidden protocols, dialogue over paternalism, distributed trust over institutional monopoly.  
This approach aligns with the principles in **🧬 Distributed Trust — Survivor-Led Ethics Infrastructure**, translating governance into relationship rather than control.  
True safeguarding begins when people are trusted with their own protection.

*🧊 The Care Cage* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It exposes how protective frameworks can become architectures of control.
