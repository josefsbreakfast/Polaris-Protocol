# ✂ Selective Precision in Atrocity Language

## 🧭 Orientation

This node examines how **atrocity language is governed asymmetrically** across geopolitical alignments.

The issue is not whether terms like *genocide*, *execution*, *war crime*, or *crimes against humanity* are legitimate.
The issue is **where, when, and against whom precision is permitted to stabilise**.

In contemporary governance systems, legal and moral precision does not function neutrally. It is **selectively tightened or loosened** to manage responsibility exposure.

---

## 🧠 Core mechanism

> **Atrocity language is deployed to regulate accountability, not merely to describe harm.**

Where attribution would implicate adversaries, language becomes:

* fast
* sharp
* morally conclusive

Where attribution would implicate allies, language becomes:

* procedural
* abstract
* endlessly deferred

This asymmetry allows power to appear principled while avoiding consequence.

## ⚙️ How selective precision operates

### 1. Precision compression (adversary states)

When violence is committed by adversary or non-aligned actors:

* *Genocide* is named early, often before legal inquiry
* *Execution* replaces neutral descriptors
* Intent is inferred rather than tested
* Aggregate numbers are foregrounded without proportional context
* Moral certainty precedes investigation

The narrative closes quickly. Questioning is reframed as denial.

---

### 2. Precision diffusion (allied states)

When comparable violence is committed by allied or Western-aligned actors:

* Legal terms are withheld or delayed
* Passive voice replaces agent attribution
* Intent is treated as unknowable or irrelevant
* Violence is reframed as an *incident*, *clash*, or *outcome*
* Legal thresholds escalate midstream

During this diffusion window, material support frequently continues.

---

### 3. Legalism as insulation layer

Legal precision is formally justified as safeguarding due process.

Selectively applied, it instead functions as:

* a delay mechanism
* a liability buffer
* a moral insulation layer for powerful actors

The governing question quietly shifts from:

> *What is happening?*

to:

> *Is it politically survivable to name this yet?*

---

## 🧩 The genocide threshold distortion

Genocide is a **specific legal category**, not a synonym for mass death.

Selective precision produces two simultaneous distortions:

1. **Over-extension** of genocide language against adversaries
2. **Hyper-restriction** of genocide language for allies

This dual distortion:

* weakens the legal category
* politicises public understanding of genocide
* enables denial where genocidal criteria may plausibly be met

The failure is not naming genocide.
It is naming it **strategically rather than consistently**.

---

## 🚨 Governance failure mode

Selective precision allows institutions to claim all three simultaneously:

* commitment to international law
* moral outrage at atrocity
* continued enablement of mass harm

Because language never stabilises, accountability never triggers.
Semantic debate replaces material intervention.

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic signals

Selective precision is usually identifiable by:

* sudden obsession with evidentiary thresholds
* disproportionate focus on intent over outcome
* demands for perfect proof only in some cases
* moral absolutism in one theatre and procedural caution in another
* warnings that naming violence would be “inflammatory” only when allies are implicated

These are **governance behaviours**, not analytical ones.
