# ✂ Selective Precision in Atrocity Language

**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18
*How legal and moral precision is tightened or loosened to manage accountability — not to describe harm.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node documents how **atrocity language is applied asymmetrically** across geopolitical alignments.

Terms such as *genocide*, *execution*, *war crime*, and *crimes against humanity* are not deployed purely on evidentiary grounds. They are deployed according to **alliance protection, liability exposure, and reputational risk**.

The problem is not imprecision.
The problem is **selective precision**.

Where attribution would implicate adversaries, language stabilises quickly and absolutely. Where attribution would implicate allies, language becomes abstract, procedural, and indefinitely deferred.

## ✨ Key Features

* Tracks how legal terminology tightens for enemies and loosens for allies
* Explains why “legal caution” often functions as accountability delay
* Separates evidentiary integrity from political insulation
* Shows how semantic asymmetry sustains material harm
* Connects language choice to governance failure modes

---

## ✂️ Precision Compression (Adversary Contexts)

When violence is committed by adversary or non-aligned actors:

* *Genocide* is named early, often before formal legal inquiry
* *Execution* replaces neutral descriptors of killing
* Intent is inferred rather than tested
* Aggregate death figures are foregrounded without proportional context
* Moral certainty precedes investigation

The narrative closes rapidly. Questioning is reframed as denial rather than due process.

---

## 🧊 Precision Diffusion (Allied Contexts)

When comparable or greater violence is committed by allied or Western-aligned actors:

* Legal terms are delayed or avoided entirely
* Passive constructions replace agent attribution
* Intent is treated as unknowable or irrelevant
* Violence becomes an *incident*, *clash*, or *tragic outcome*
* Evidentiary thresholds escalate midstream

During this diffusion window, political, military, or economic support frequently continues.

---

## ⚖️ Legalism as Insulation

Legal precision is publicly framed as safeguarding due process and preventing misuse of serious terms.

Selectively applied, it instead functions as:

* a delay mechanism
* a liability buffer
* a moral insulation layer for powerful actors

The governing question shifts from:

> *What is happening?*

to:

> *Is it survivable to name this now?*

---

## 🧬 The Genocide Threshold Distortion

Genocide is a **specific legal category**, not a synonym for mass death.

Selective precision produces two simultaneous distortions:

* **Over-extension** of genocide language against adversaries
* **Hyper-restriction** of genocide language for allies

This dual misuse:

* weakens the legal category
* politicises public understanding of genocide
* enables denial where genocidal criteria may plausibly be met

The failure is not naming genocide.
It is naming it **strategically rather than consistently**.

---

## 🧠 Governance Failure Mode

Selective precision allows institutions to claim all three simultaneously:

* commitment to international law
* moral outrage at atrocity
* continued enablement of mass harm

Because language never stabilises, accountability never triggers.
Semantic debate replaces material intervention.

---

## 🚨 Diagnostic Signals

Selective precision is usually identifiable by:

* sudden obsession with evidentiary thresholds
* disproportionate focus on intent over outcome
* demands for perfect proof only in some cases
* moral absolutism in one theatre and procedural caution in another
* warnings that naming violence would be “inflammatory” only when allies are implicated

These are **governance behaviours**, not analytical ones.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Selective precision** = semantic control of accountability
* **Legal caution** = variable, not neutral
* **Atrocity language** = governance infrastructure, not description

The work is not to abolish legal standards, but to **apply them consistently**.

*✂ Selective Precision in Atrocity Language* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how legal and moral precision is selectively applied to manage responsibility exposure rather than to prevent harm.
