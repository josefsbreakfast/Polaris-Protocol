# 🤝 Held by Other People’s Alliances  
**First created:** 2025-10-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*A meditation and diagnostic map for when one’s agency is mediated, muted, or credentialed through the alliances of others.*

---

## Context
Alliances are meant to protect, amplify, or co-create.  
But when power asymmetry sets in, the alliance itself can become a containment vessel.  
This node explores how solidarity transforms into stewardship, then into quiet ownership — how care networks become holding patterns.

---

## Core Problem
Being “held” by another’s alliance means your legitimacy, access, or narrative is conditional upon their continued goodwill.  
It appears as support but functions as custody.

**Common symptoms:**
- You are referenced but rarely quoted directly.  
- Your work circulates through intermediaries who control its framing.  
- Invitations arrive filtered through someone else’s institutional ethics.  
- “Protection” replaces permission.  

---

## Diagnostic Lenses
1. **Dependency** – what material or reputational resources flow only through the alliance?  
2. **Visibility** – who gets named when your work moves?  
3. **Consent Drift** – how does joint authorship quietly become custodianship?  
4. **Exit Conditions** – can you withdraw without loss of livelihood or legitimacy?  
5. **Ethical Reversal** – when does allyship require your silence?

---

## Strategies of Reclamation
- **Re-centre Authorship:** insist on first-person framing, even within collective projects.  
- **Document Drift:** keep a private ledger of edits, redactions, and reframings.  
- **Mutual Review Clauses:** build consent checkpoints into MOUs and partnerships.  
- **Decouple Legitimacy:** diversify citation and funding sources.  
- **Soft Refusal:** decline protective framing that requires erasure.

## Ethical Reflection
True alliance is not *holding* but *listening while letting go.*  
This node asks both sides of any partnership to distinguish between *care* and *containment* — between solidarity as shelter and solidarity as leash.

## 🌌 Constellations

## 🏮 Footer
This node is for those whose names circulate only inside other people’s safety plans.  
To be “held” can be both comfort and capture.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
