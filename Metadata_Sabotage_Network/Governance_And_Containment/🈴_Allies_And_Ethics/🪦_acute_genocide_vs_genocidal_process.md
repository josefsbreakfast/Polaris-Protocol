# 🪦 Acute Genocide vs Genocidal Process (Asymmetric Deployment)  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*How genocide is framed as an event for enemies and a process for allies — and why that distinction delays accountability.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines how the concept of **genocide is asymmetrically framed** depending on political alignment.

In adversary contexts, genocide is treated as **acute**: a discrete crime that can be rapidly named, morally fixed, and acted upon.

In allied contexts, genocide is reframed as a **genocidal process**: slow, contested, evidentiary-heavy, and perpetually pending confirmation.

The issue is not whether genocide can be a process. It can.
The issue is **who is allowed immediacy** and **who is sentenced to delay**.

## ✨ Key Features

* Distinguishes acute genocide framing from process framing
* Shows how process language delays legal and political triggers
* Explains why temporal framing reallocates responsibility
* Separates analytical nuance from strategic deferral
* Connects genocide discourse to alliance protection

## 🪦 Two Frames, One Crime

### Acute Genocide

In acute framing, genocide is:

* event-like
* morally settled
* attributable in real time
* actionable before full evidentiary closure

This framing enables:

* sanctions
* arms embargoes
* diplomatic isolation
* emergency legal action

It treats prevention as legitimate even under uncertainty.

---

### Genocidal Process

In process framing, genocide is:

* gradual
* cumulative
* evidentiary-intensive
* permanently “under review”

This framing emphasises:

* intent thresholds
* pattern accumulation
* retrospective confirmation

Action is deferred until after harm has fully materialised.

---

## ⚖️ Asymmetric Deployment

The same analytical distinction is deployed differently depending on alignment:

* **Enemies** → genocide is acute, obvious, and urgent
* **Allies** → genocide is theoretical, future-tense, and contestable

This asymmetry is not methodological.
It is **political**.

---

## 🧠 How Process Language Functions as Delay

Process framing shifts focus from:

* outcomes → intent
* effects → thresholds
* prevention → documentation

This produces three governance effects:

1. **Delay without denial** — harm is acknowledged but action is postponed
2. **Burden shifting** — proof obligations fall on victims and observers
3. **Retroactive morality** — condemnation is reserved for after prevention is no longer possible

---

## 🚨 Governance Failure Mode

When genocide is permanently framed as a process:

* early warning becomes politically inert
* prevention becomes legally risky
* accountability becomes retrospective

The system learns genocide **only after it has finished**.

This is not a failure of foresight.
It is a failure of will.

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Signals

Asymmetric genocide framing is usually identifiable when:

* genocide is named quickly in one context and endlessly debated in another
* intent is treated as knowable for enemies and unknowable for allies
* emergency language appears selectively
* prevention is framed as “premature” only in some cases
* legal caution aligns cleanly with alliance interests

These are not analytical differences.
They are **deployment choices**.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Acute framing** = legitimacy for early action
* **Process framing** = legitimacy for delay
* **Asymmetry** = alliance protection

Analytical nuance becomes harmful when it is **selectively weaponised**.

*🪦 Acute Genocide vs Genocidal Process (Asymmetric Deployment)* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.
It documents how temporal framing of genocide is used to accelerate action against enemies and defer responsibility for allies.
