# 🪞 Mirror Ethics — When Empathy Becomes Extraction  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*How empathy and allyship drift into mimicry, extraction, or performance.*

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Examines how empathy — when unexamined — converts into narrative extraction.  
Explores the thin line between solidarity and surveillance when allies replicate survivor language, tone, or affect for legitimacy.  
Asks how care can invert into containment when emotional resonance replaces structural redistribution.

### 🧠 Empathy as Access  
Empathy opens doors—but sometimes to places that should stay private.  
When survivors narrate trauma publicly, listeners often experience affective identification: *I feel what you feel.*  
Without awareness, that sensation becomes a claim of access—a sense of right to interpret, reproduce, or manage another’s story.  
Empathy then acts as a credential for authority, granting outsiders permission to speak in the survivor’s voice.  
The result is a paradox: emotional proximity without accountability.  

---

### 🪼 Mimicry and Moral Licensing  
Maps how empathy drifts into mimicry.  
Allies and institutions unconsciously borrow survivor tone—rawness, humour, cadence—to perform sincerity.  
This mimicry signals closeness, but it also launders power.  
By sounding like the harmed, the powerful acquire moral cover while keeping control.  
This process, sometimes called *moral licensing*, lets people feel ethical for reproducing the language of justice without practising its redistribution.  
The more convincingly they mirror, the harder it becomes to challenge them.

### 🧨 Extraction Loops in Advocacy  
Shows how advocacy spaces can become feedback loops of empathy extraction.  
Stories of harm are circulated, paraphrased, and re-performed until they no longer belong to the tellers.  
Panels, trainings, and social-media campaigns depend on a steady supply of affective material to sustain attention.  
Each repetition thins the story, turning testimony into resource.  
Empathy becomes the extraction tool: mining pain for content, impact, or policy traction.  
As in **Pain as Credential**, the system rewards repetition over repair.

### 🐦‍🔥 Countermoves: Reflective Distance, Reciprocal Authorship  
Outlines methods for resisting mirror capture.  
Reflective distance means feeling with rather than through—maintaining self-awareness of difference and boundary.  
Reciprocal authorship recognises that empathy is relational work, not one-way witnessing: quote with consent, share credit, return visibility.  
In practical terms, this means slowing down before echoing someone’s phrasing or tone, citing origin clearly, and asking whether reproduction adds care or merely resonance.  
The goal is not less empathy but more precision: warmth without theft, solidarity without simulation.

*🪞 Mirror Ethics — When Empathy Becomes Extraction* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It studies how empathy can become a vector of capture rather than connection.
