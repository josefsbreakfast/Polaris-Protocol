# 🧬 Distributed Trust — Survivor-Led Ethics Infrastructure  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-22  
*Blueprint for decentralised, survivor-governed ethics models.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
Explores how ethics could operate outside carceral or institutional oversight — through peer governance, transparent decision-records, and distributed consent verification.  
Proposes a model of integrity built on **reciprocity, visibility, and shared sovereignty**, rather than credentialed authority.  
Ethics becomes infrastructure: something you can inspect, audit, and iterate, not an opaque gatekeeping ritual.

### 🏛️ The Limits of Institutional Ethics  
Most formal ethics frameworks are designed to protect institutions, not participants.  
Their processes—risk matrices, approval boards, and non-disclosure clauses—translate moral judgment into administrative control.  
“Ethical clearance” functions as liability insurance, not moral inquiry.  
These systems inherit the carceral logics of surveillance and consent-as-compliance: asking permission only to proceed exactly as before.  
Survivor testimony often disappears inside confidentiality clauses, while institutions publicise the virtue of having listened.  
The result is an **ethics of containment**, where care is reduced to paperwork.  

---

### 🧿 Peer-Governed Review Models  
Introduces survivor-led and peer-governed alternatives to top-down review.  
Instead of central boards, review is handled by rotating councils or “trust circles” composed of those with lived experience relevant to each case.  
Deliberation occurs in transparent logs—minutes, reflections, and outcome rationales—open to audit by participants.  
Ethical legitimacy derives from *process visibility* and *collective reasoning*, not hierarchy.  
Consensus doesn’t mean unanimity; it means traceable dissent.  
This restores moral accountability to the community most affected by the outcome.  

---

### 🎋 Distributed Trust Ledger  
Sketches the architecture for a distributed consent and ethics ledger.  
Using cryptographically signed attestations or open audit trails, each contribution—decision, objection, approval—is timestamped and verifiable without central ownership.  
The ledger records *why* a choice was made, not just *that* it was made.  
Participants retain agency over their data: consent tokens can be revoked or updated in real time.  
This structure allows multi-node governance—local autonomy linked through shared protocols—so ethics can scale without reverting to bureaucracy.  
Distributed trust replaces credentialed trust: reliability proven through transparency, not pedigree.  

---

### 🌿 Practical Pilots & Case Examples  
Outlines early prototypes and applicable models.  
- **Community Review Boards** in survivor collectives, handling research partnerships without institutional intermediaries.  
- **Mutual Consent APIs**, enabling data-sharing only through verified peer agreements.  
- **Ethics Pods**, small groups that evaluate each other’s work in rotation, archiving decisions openly.  
These pilots show how survivor governance can meet legal and technical standards while preserving agency.  
The aim is not to abolish oversight but to **redistribute it**, embedding care in the architecture of consent.
