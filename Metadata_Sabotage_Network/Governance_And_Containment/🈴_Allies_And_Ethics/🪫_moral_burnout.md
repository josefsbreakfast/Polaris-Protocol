### 🧠 From Empathy to Exhaustion  
Chronic exposure to suffering can drain ethical energy as surely as physical labour.  
Advocates, researchers, and carers often internalise responsibility for systemic failure, mistaking depletion for objectivity.  
When empathy runs on fumes, detachment feels like relief—and is often rewarded as “balance.”  
This emotional collapse disguises itself as maturity: the belief that to stay sane, one must stop feeling.  

---

### ✂️ Institutional Incentives to Withdraw  
Institutions quietly benefit from collective burnout.  
The fatigued worker or scholar poses no threat; their disillusionment reads as professionalism.  
By rewarding emotional distance with promotion or credibility, organisations convert moral fatigue into compliance.  
The language of neutrality—“both sides,” “measured tone,” “policy focus”—becomes a safety valve for reputational risk.  
Withdrawal is lauded as wisdom precisely because it keeps systems intact.

### 🏛️ The Aesthetics of Neutrality  
Neutrality has a look: the calm voice, the centred statement, the carefully hedged paragraph.  
It performs authority through absence of emotion.  
But this aesthetic masks a choice—one to side with power by refusing to acknowledge harm.  
In media and academia alike, neutrality functions as an alibi for inaction.  
Its surface restraint conceals the deep exhaustion of those who once cared too much and were never replenished.  

---

### 🐍 Re-Energising Ethical Clarity  
Proposes recovery through re-alignment, not retreat.  
Clarity requires rest, boundaries, and collective maintenance rather than perpetual output.  
Ethical energy regenerates when care becomes shared, not hoarded—when individuals act within networks of mutual responsibility.  
True neutrality is impossible; honesty about positionality is more sustainable than pretense of distance.  
To move beyond burnout is to reclaim conviction without martyrdom: to feel again, wisely.
