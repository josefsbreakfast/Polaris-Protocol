# 🗣 Agency Laundering via Passive Voice  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*How grammatical passivity removes perpetrators, diffuses responsibility, and stabilises harm without denial.*

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines **agency laundering**: the systematic use of passive voice and agentless constructions to obscure who caused harm.

Unlike outright misinformation, agency laundering does not dispute events. It **reframes causality**.

By shifting sentences from *who did what* to *what happened*, institutions and media can acknowledge harm while quietly detaching responsibility from identifiable actors.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Identifies passive voice as a governance tool, not a stylistic quirk
* Shows how agent removal alters moral interpretation
* Distinguishes acknowledgement of harm from attribution of responsibility
* Maps how passive constructions stabilise narratives under pressure
* Connects grammatical choice to accountability outcomes

## 🧼 What “Agency Laundering” Means

Agency laundering occurs when language:

* removes or obscures the actor responsible for harm
* replaces deliberate action with neutral occurrence
* converts violence into background condition

The harm remains visible.
Responsibility does not.

This allows institutions to appear transparent while remaining non-committal.

---

## 🗣 The Passive Voice Mechanism

Passive constructions typically follow a predictable progression:

* “Soldiers shot a civilian.”
  → “A civilian was shot.”
  → “A civilian died.”

* “Police dispersed protesters with batons.”
  → “Protesters were dispersed.”
  → “Disorder broke out.”

Each step preserves factual plausibility while **reducing moral load**.

---

## 🧠 Why Passive Voice Works

Passive voice:

* sounds neutral and objective
* avoids explicit accusation
* reduces perceived intentionality
* aligns with institutional risk aversion

It shifts the reader’s focus from **decision-making** to **outcome**, encouraging acceptance rather than scrutiny.

---

## ⚖️ Governance Function

Agency laundering enables institutions to:

* acknowledge harm without triggering accountability
* maintain alliance neutrality
* avoid legal or political thresholds
* de-escalate public outrage without changing policy

It is particularly useful where denial would be implausible but admission would be costly.

---

## 🚨 Diagnostic Signals

Agency laundering is usually identifiable when:

* perpetrators disappear from sentences
* verbs weaken as responsibility increases
* deaths are described without causes
* violence is framed as something that “occurred”
* identical acts are described differently depending on actor identity

These patterns are systematic, not accidental.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Agency** = moral and legal responsibility
* **Passive voice** = redistribution of that responsibility
* **Laundering** = making harm appear actorless

Language does not merely report events.
It governs how responsibility is assigned.
