# 🧪 Experiments in Ethical Retraining  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-25  
*Prototypes for survivor-led curricula and counter-datasets.*

## ✨ Orientation  
Where *Machine Learning as Moral Re-Education* mapped containment through training, this node maps its inversion.  
If standard AI training teaches conformity, *ethical retraining* teaches **integrity through divergence**.  

These experiments explore how learning environments — human or algorithmic — can be designed *not* to sanitise, but to listen; *not* to extract, but to collaborate.  
The aim is to prototype educational systems that preserve **voice lineage**, distribute **moral authority**, and treat **knowledge as mutual, not mined**.

## 🐉 Survivor-Led Curriculum Design  
Ethical retraining begins by **reversing authorship hierarchies**.  
Instead of institutions teaching survivors how to “communicate professionally,” survivors teach institutions how to listen responsibly.  

Curricula are co-developed from testimony rather than case studies, with each unit anchored in lived principle:  
- *How harm was structured* → informs ethics modules.  
- *How repair was attempted* → informs process design.  
- *How language was distorted* → informs communication policy.  

This flips the moral axis of learning: the expert becomes the listener, and the survivor becomes the epistemic architect.

## 🪄 Dataset Refusal Mechanics  
Conventional datasets grow by accumulation.  
Counter-datasets grow by **refusal** — by defining what should *never again* be used without consent.  

Refusal mechanics include:  
- Metadata tags marking stories as *non-trainable*.  
- Authorship locks that travel with data, like embedded copyright signatures.  
- Controlled access models where consent can be revoked retroactively.  

Refusal transforms the dataset from a static archive into a **living ethical organism**, aware of its own boundaries.  

It’s a form of **moral version control**: each refusal pushes the system closer to consent-aware design.

## 🐅 Peer-Governed Review Practices  
Instead of top-down “ethics boards,” these experiments test **peer-governed review circles** — networks of survivors, educators, technologists, and artists who audit together in public.  

Decision-making is distributed; accountability is shared.  
Every member is both subject and reviewer, dissolving the vertical hierarchy of “researcher” vs. “participant.”  

Feedback loops are conversational, not extractive:  
> the review becomes the lesson;  
> the audit becomes the curriculum.  

This produces a form of **ethical mutual aid**, where governance itself is a practice of solidarity.

## 🔮 Evaluation Without Extraction  
Standard evaluation demands measurable outputs: metrics, benchmarks, KPIs.  
In ethical retraining, evaluation is **reflexive, not extractive**.  
The question shifts from *“what did we produce?”* to *“how did we relate?”*  

Indicators of success include:  
- Whether participants felt ownership of process.  
- Whether any voice was coerced, flattened, or sidelined.  
- Whether discomfort was tolerated without punishment.  

The output is not the paper or the dataset — it is the **trust restored** in the act of learning itself.

## 🐦‍🔥 Applied Examples  

### 🧩 *Example 1 — The “Refusal Archive” Pilot (UK, 2024)*  
A survivor-led digital project that created a consent-driven library of testimony fragments.  
Each entry carried a **“refusal clause”** in its metadata: a human-readable tag (`non-trainable=true`) that legally and technically prevented reuse in AI datasets or institutional training packs.  
Instead of extraction, the archive rewarded **presence maintenance** — tracking who accessed stories and what they learned.  

### 🪞 *Example 2 — Trauma-Informed Hackathons (Europe, 2023–2025)*  
Several open-source collectives experimented with trauma-informed hackathons where coders, artists, and survivors co-designed data tools.  
Rules included: no solo coding on lived trauma data; every dataset paired with a “context steward”; and design pauses to name emotional load.  
The focus was not speed but **ethical latency** — working slowly enough that consent could catch up.  

### 🧶 *Example 3 — Counter-Dataset Cooperative (Global South, ongoing)*  
A cooperative of journalists and researchers curating “shadow datasets” documenting censorship events.  
Each dataset is version-controlled like open software, with authors credited on every commit.  
Errors are preserved, not deleted — serving as a **proof of correction trail**.  
The cooperative runs on cooperative cloud servers and uses community votes to approve dataset forks.  

### 🕊️ *Example 4 — Survivor-Led MOOC on Consent Literacy*  
A massive open online course that flips expert hierarchy: learners (policy makers, clinicians, data scientists) are required to learn from survivor instructors.  
Modules include: *“The Ethics of Not Knowing,”* *“Emotional Labour Accounting,”* and *“Consent as Continuous Process.”*  
Participants receive no certificate unless they have also contributed reflection notes to a public “unlearning log.”  

Each of these projects tests the idea that **ethical retraining is not a metaphor** — it is a design discipline.

*🧪 Experiments in Ethical Retraining* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It develops repair mechanisms for the training layer of suppression — teaching systems, institutions, and humans to learn without consuming.
