# 💾 Archival Drift: When Updates Delete History  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
*Digital forensics of policy migrations and auto-purge erasures.*  

---

## ✨ Orientation  
Investigates how **content management systems**, **LMS migrations**, and **training platform refreshes** quietly erase early warnings or inconvenient histories.  
These “updates” are not neutral. They perform an **aesthetic of renewal** that disguises **forensic loss** — evidence of abuse, dissent, or malfunction overwritten by corporate templates of “improvement.”  

Archival drift is the entropy of bureaucratic truth. It happens when compliance systems treat their own previous versions as **corrupted relics** rather than as **accountability anchors**.

## ✈️ LMS Migrations and Lost Files  
When platforms migrate — SharePoint → Teams → PowerBI → bespoke dashboards — attachments break, file paths rot, and metadata hierarchies flatten.  
Institutions call this “streamlining.” But for forensic reconstruction, the effect is catastrophic: *embedded evidence is rendered untraceable.*  

In training portals, this often erases prior safeguarding reports or staff alerts once a new “version” of the same module replaces the old. Audit logs rarely survive migration; administrators frame this as a technical limitation rather than a governance decision.

## 🕳️ Auto-Purge as Policy  
“Auto-delete after 90 days.”  
“Purge inactive accounts.”  
“Archive retention capped at one year.”  

These rules are sold as efficiency or privacy compliance — but in practice, they create an **engineered amnesia**.  
Auto-purge cycles mimic bureaucratic forgetting: history is replaced by an illusion of freshness. The longer a case runs, the more likely its early trace is silently expunged.  

In investigative terms, this constitutes **metadata laundering** — the removal of contextual evidence through automation.

## 🍃 The Aesthetic of Fresh Starts  
Interface updates promise a clean, modern experience.  
But beneath every redesign lies an exorcism: broken URLs, deprecated warnings, vanished comment threads.  
This design rhetoric of *“moving forward”* detaches institutions from their own archival lineage, allowing reputational resets without acknowledging responsibility.  

Digital renewal becomes the institutional equivalent of a public confession scrubbed from record — a bureaucratic baptism by deletion.

---

## 🫁 Archival Counter-Practices  
Resisting drift requires **shadow archiving**:  
- Manual captures (screenshots, PDFs, WARC files) before migrations.  
- Parallel timestamping of policy revisions.  
- Survivor-led repositories where context is preserved before deletion.  
- Forensic documentation of *absence itself* — noting when files vanish or dates reset.  

Archival drift is not inevitable. It is the by-product of systems designed for *convenience over continuity*.  
Counter-archiving insists that memory has evidentiary value — that the fragments left behind are *not noise*, but *proof*.

*💾 Archival Drift* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It treats each deleted version as forensic evidence of containment by refresh — the bureaucratic erasure beneath the promise of progress.
