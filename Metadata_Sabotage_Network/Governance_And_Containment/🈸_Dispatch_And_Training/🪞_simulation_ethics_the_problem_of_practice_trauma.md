# 🪞 Simulation Ethics — The Problem of “Practice Trauma”  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-20  
*Critiquing empathy drills, VR modules, and trauma simulations.*

## 🧿 Orientation  
In recent years, educational institutions, charities, and public agencies have embraced **simulation** as a tool for empathy.  
Trainees are invited to “step into the shoes” of others — refugees, disabled people, trauma survivors — through immersive workshops,  
VR headsets, or controlled role-plays.  

But empathy rehearsed through artificial suffering risks **replicating the very asymmetry it claims to undo**.  
This node interrogates how simulation converts pain into pedagogy,  
and how “practice trauma” becomes an institutional ritual for cleansing guilt rather than sharing understanding.

## 💰 Empathy as Experience Economy  
In the modern training market, empathy has become a **commodity**.  
Courses promise “lived experience” in digestible doses — grief in fifteen minutes, oppression in a headset,  
poverty simulated with game tokens and time limits.  

Such exercises create the illusion of understanding without the reality of accountability.  
They allow participants to feel momentarily enlightened without confronting the systemic conditions that produce the pain.  
This is the **experience economy of virtue**: the conversion of someone else’s history into temporary self-improvement.  

The deeper harm lies in how institutions learn to **measure compassion** by how convincingly people perform it.  
Care becomes a compliance metric.

## 🧨 Consent in Simulated Suffering  
Real trauma cannot be safely replicated; it can only be represented.  
Yet simulations blur this boundary, asking participants to *perform* fear, violation, or marginalisation  
while actual survivors often watch from the margins — unpaid, uncredited, or retraumatised by proxy.  

Ethical simulation demands two kinds of consent:  
- **Consent of the represented**, whose stories are being modelled.  
- **Consent of the participant**, who may not anticipate their own emotional reaction.  

Most programs secure the latter but neglect the former.  
The right to be depicted — or not depicted — is a **moral boundary**, not an optional courtesy.  
Without survivor authorship, simulations risk becoming emotional tourism:  
a field trip into other people’s pain.

## 🪼 Institutional Theatre of Care  
The stagecraft of simulation often masks institutional anxiety.  
Hospitals, police forces, and NGOs adopt “empathy drills” to demonstrate responsiveness —  
a public rehearsal of compassion designed as much for optics as for reform.  

This creates what sociologists call the **theatre of care**:  
performative exercises that display sensitivity while deflecting scrutiny.  
The result is a choreography of listening — carefully managed vulnerability that never touches structural power.  

When participants cry on schedule and facilitators collect feedback forms,  
the exercise concludes with catharsis but no accountability.  
Pain is processed, not repaired.

## 🐦‍🔥 Survivor-Led Alternatives  
There are better ways to teach empathy than to mimic suffering.  
Survivor-led training reframes learning around **co-authorship, not enactment**.  
Instead of pretending to live another’s experience, participants learn to analyse how systems produce harm,  
and how they can modify their own practices to reduce it.  

Alternative approaches include:  
- **Testimony Workshops** — survivors design and narrate the learning process.  
- **System Mapping Exercises** — participants chart where institutional decisions cause harm.  
- **Reflective Role Inversion** — staff examine their own thresholds of empathy and authority.  

These models prioritise **ethical distance with moral proximity**:  
you do not need to play the victim to stand beside one.

## 🫀 The Ethics of Feeling  
Simulation ethics also questions the assumption that empathy is inherently good.  
Feeling deeply is not the same as acting justly.  
Without structures for reflection, empathy becomes a **performance loop** —  
an emotional spike that fades before it can mature into solidarity.  

True compassion requires **translation into conduct**:  
policy change, resource redistribution, listening protocols, survivor compensation.  
In this light, the problem is not that empathy drills fail to feel enough —  
it is that they feel without **consequence**.  

Ethical training begins when institutions accept that discomfort is not damage,  
and that understanding cannot be outsourced to technology.

## 🦩 The Economy of Display — When Learning Feels Like Exploitation  
For many participants, being asked to “learn from” another’s trauma feels less like education and more like exposure.  
In these exercises, pain is packaged for consumption: a story to be acted, graded, and then forgotten.  

When survivors’ experiences are mined for authenticity and repackaged as teaching material,  
it echoes the logics of **sex work without consent** — intimacy extracted, emotion commodified, and value assigned by those in power.  
The transaction is rarely equitable: those whose suffering anchors the lesson are seldom compensated,  
and their agency over representation disappears beneath the facilitator’s moral choreography.  

This dynamic is **heavily gendered**.  
Empathy work is disproportionately performed by women and marginalised people,  
while institutional authority — the power to design and profit from that empathy —  
is often held by men or hierarchically privileged actors.  
The result is not solidarity but **emotional extraction**: care as currency, compassion as spectacle.  

Historically, this practice descends from the **freak show and the moral exhibition**,  
where difference and distress were staged for moral reassurance.  
Early twentieth-century “social hygiene” displays, missionary testimonials, and vaudeville charity acts  
used the suffering body as proof of institutional virtue.  
Today’s trauma simulations often reproduce that lineage under the banner of inclusion.  

To witness pain ethically, institutions must abandon this economy of display.  
Learning should not require someone’s degradation as demonstration.  
Where empathy is truly sought, it must be invited through co-creation, not staged consumption.

This node examines how performative empathy can become another form of control,  
and how truth requires co-authorship, consent, and structural reflection.

*🪞 Simulation Ethics — The Problem of “Practice Trauma”* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It critiques empathy drills that replay harm for spectacle and offers survivor-led alternatives rooted in consent, co-authorship, and structural change.  
It recognises the gendered economies of care that turn suffering into curriculum and demands new ethics of witness.
