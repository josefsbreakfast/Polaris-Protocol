*Tracing authorship loss in training case studies.*

## 🔥 Orientation  
Institutions often speak through survivors while simultaneously silencing them.  
This node examines how *authentic testimony* — words written to expose harm — becomes recoded into **training material**, **case examples**, or **best-practice slides** stripped of emotional resonance.  

Once anonymised and polished for professional consumption, the survivor’s story re-enters circulation as *data*, not voice.  
This is what we call the **institutional voice-over**: the process by which raw experience is overdubbed with bureaucratic narration until authorship disappears.

---

## ✨ From Testimony to Template  
Every survivor text begins as a living signal — a fragment of lived truth.  
But through report-writing, safeguarding frameworks, or “reflective practice” exercises, that signal is flattened into template.  

The transformation follows a predictable script:  
> testimony → case summary → bullet-point lesson → risk mitigation slide  

Each step removes tone, specificity, and agency.  
The survivor becomes an “example,” their narrative retrofitted to demonstrate compliance success rather than systemic failure.

## ✂️ The Loss of Tone  
Tone is the soul of authorship.  
When institutions rewrite testimony, they neutralise the emotional charge that made the story legible in the first place.  
Fear becomes *“distress”*, anger becomes *“concern”*, resistance becomes *“non-compliance.”*  

Tone-loss operates as a form of containment: it keeps the story speakable but **unfelt**.  
Readers are trained to process trauma as policy vocabulary, safely abstracted from human consequence.  

To study tone-loss is therefore to trace **where empathy is edited out** — where risk management replaces recognition.  

> *They cut off pieces of you, until you fit.*

## 🚩 Credit, Consent, and Erasure  
Many case studies originate in consent forms that promise “training use only.”  
But consent without context is not sovereignty.  
When stories are re-told without the author’s ongoing participation, the institution gains both **narrative control** and **ethical insulation**.  

Credit vanishes first: no attribution, no lineage.  
Then meaning dissolves: the voice now serves the very structure it once opposed.  

This is **ethical laundering through anonymity** — a system that celebrates lessons learned while quietly erasing who paid the cost of that learning.

## 🐦‍🔥 Reclaiming Narrative Integrity  
Reclamation begins with refusing ventriloquism.  
Survivor authors can counter the institutional voice-over by:  
- Maintaining their own archives of drafts, notes, and oral histories.  
- Publishing under collective or pseudonymous authorship to retain narrative autonomy.  
- Embedding metadata or stylistic signatures that assert origin.  
- Requesting removal or correction when institutional reuse distorts meaning.  

Institutions, in turn, must learn to host testimony **without translation** — to let lived tone coexist with procedural language rather than be overwritten by it.  

Voice integrity is not a courtesy; it is **forensic evidence of consent**.

## 🏮 Footer  
*🗣️ Survivor Scripts and Institutional Voice-Over* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It reveals how authentic voices are retuned to fit bureaucratic registers — and how reclaiming tone becomes an act of resistance against narrative erasure.
