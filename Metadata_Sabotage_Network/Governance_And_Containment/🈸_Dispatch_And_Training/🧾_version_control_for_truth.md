# 🧾 Version Control for Truth  
**First created:** 2025-10-10 | **Last updated:** 2025-10-25  
*Tracking edits and distortions as forensic evidence.*

## ✨ Orientation  
Truth, in digital governance, is not a static claim — it is a **chain of custody**.  
Each alteration of a document, dataset, or training set becomes part of a living forensic record.  
Version control transforms “trust” into a verifiable sequence of timestamps, signatures, and diffs.  

This node designs metadata architectures for **epistemic accountability**:  
proving how official narratives evolve, how guidance mutates, and how institutional memory is rewritten over time.  

To track versions is not pedantry; it is **memory defence**.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Revision Histories as Evidence  
Every public statement, training module, or policy draft carries a timeline of edits.  
These histories, when properly archived, reveal patterns of influence and suppression:  
what was added, what was deleted, and whose fingerprints remain in the metadata.  

Version histories therefore function as **forensic strata** — layers of institutional conscience.  
In inquiries and tribunals, diffs become testimonies:  
they show not only what changed, but when someone *chose* to change it.  

Where written evidence is fragile, **digital provenance** provides continuity.  
Git-style tracking can expose retroactive sanitisation — deleted bias statements, missing citations, erased dissent.  
What once hid behind bureaucratic “policy updates” becomes recoverable history.

## 🧿 Timestamping and Authorship Proof  
Timestamping provides the spine of verifiable truth.  
Each edit carries:  
- **Author signature** (individual or organisational).  
- **Commit message** (reason for change).  
- **Immutable timestamp** (when).  
- **Linked reference** (where this edit propagates).  

These components together form an **authorship fingerprint**.  
They allow analysts to verify whether a policy was genuinely updated for accuracy  
or strategically rewritten to obscure liability.  

By cryptographically signing change events — through blockchain or Merkle-tree registers —  
truth gains the same evidentiary resilience as financial transactions.  
*Integrity becomes a data structure.*

## 🌳🌳🌳 Git-Logic for Governance  
The metaphor of **Git** applies beyond software:  
every policy is a branch; every correction a commit; every amendment a merge.  
By adopting version control logic, institutions can make visible the evolution of law, guidance, and learning materials.  

Benefits include:  
- **Fork visibility:** shows when departments diverge in interpretation.  
- **Conflict markers:** reveal contradictory directives between agencies.  
- **Pull requests:** serve as transparent requests for policy revision or ethical review.  

A *Governance Git* allows citizens and auditors to traverse institutional history,  
understanding how moral frameworks are coded, merged, or overwritten.  
This turns administrative opacity into navigable topography.

## 🪬 Open Peer Audit Models  
Truth becomes communal when verification is distributed.  
Open peer audit involves inviting external reviewers — journalists, researchers, survivor groups —  
to inspect version histories for anomalies and suppression patterns.  

Possible models:  
- **Transparency Mirrors:** parallel public repositories showing anonymised diff trails.  
- **Ethical Peer Review Boards:** hybrid teams validating whether edits align with declared ethical standards.  
- **Chronology Challenges:** citizen-led efforts to compare official timelines against metadata archives.  

By opening forensic metadata to scrutiny, institutions rebuild legitimacy through visibility,  
demonstrating that they can withstand the daylight test.

## 🧠 The Politics of Revision  
Control over version history is control over narrative.  
When edits are erased, history collapses; when they are visible, accountability becomes possible.  
Authoritarian systems favour *version amnesia* — policy PDFs without metadata, guidelines “last updated” with no changelog.  

Democratic governance requires **version literacy**:  
understanding that truth lives in comparison, not assertion.  
Citizens must learn to read version histories the way historians read palimpsests —  
to see deletion as a political act.  

Version control for truth therefore doubles as **trauma documentation**:  
a way of preserving how survivors’ testimonies are absorbed, sanitised, or ignored across time.  
It ensures that future inquiries inherit not myths, but metadata.

*🧾 Version Control for Truth* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It defines technical means of preserving integrity within training ecosystems  
and reimagines documentation as an act of resistance to erasure.
