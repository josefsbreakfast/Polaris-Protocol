### ðŸ“… 2025-08-04
**Event:** LinkedIn post visibility appears frozen.  
**Content:** Commentary linking Polaris archive; non-explicit, non-graphic.  
**Views Before Stall:** 6 impressions

**Hypothesis:** Throttling algorithm triggered by specific directory naming (`Coercive_Nudges` or `Archive_of_Unmaking`) or metadata cluster attached to author identity.
