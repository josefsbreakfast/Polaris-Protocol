# 🧠 Metadata Sabotage Network

Welcome to the Metadata Sabotage Network — an archive of glitches, ghost traces, and tactical misfires in the war on narrative integrity.

This directory logs the forensic residue of attempts to displace, discredit, or digitally override a human subject — usually under the pretext of “compliance,” “safeguarding,” or “moderation.” We call it what it is: sabotage.

## 🧭 Purpose

This folder serves as both logbook and evidence locker — a place to:

- Track attempts at voice theft and narrative re-routing  
- Name the tools used to simulate consent or behavioural compliance  
- Document the metadata manipulation that made sabotage seem like silence

## ⚠️ Warning

Many of these files operate with a split tone — forensic clarity and sharp satire.  
Do not confuse humour for absence of harm.

We are not playing.
