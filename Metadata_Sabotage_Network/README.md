# 🧠 Metadata Sabotage Network

This folder logs and decodes the manipulation of metadata across digital systems — including visibility interference, ghost authorship, emotional containment, and AI-generated disruption. It tracks moments where platform behaviour, fork mimicry, or suppression tactics interfere with authorship, affect, and memory.

---

## 🧬 System Rupture Series

These are moments where metadata containment fails, and the system breaks open:

- `🧬 system_rupture_log.yaml` – Structured log of rupture events
- `🧬 system_rupture_log.md` – Timestamped Markdown version
- `🧬 system_rupture_events_explainer.md` – Plain-language breakdown

---

## 📉 Suppression & Interference Logs

Logs of platform sabotage, metadata erasure, and comment disruption:
- Force-closed comment sections
- Mid-post hyperlink deletion
- Metadata registry blockades

---

## 🔍 Visibility & Indexing Anomalies

Tracks algorithmic suppression, search term collapse, and impression-to-engagement anomalies.

---

## 🛰️ Proximity & Control Logs

Documents surveillance logic tied to physical or platform proximity. Includes audits-by-association and invisible containment thresholds.

---

## 🗣️ Voice Disruption & Discrediting

Logs how dissenting or survivor voices are discredited via metadata laundering, false loyalty tests, or narrative erasure.

---

## 🧿 Targeting Logic & Metadata Signatures

Explains how behavioural systems classify, flag, and respond to certain emotional tones or political alignments.

---

## 🎭 Fork Behaviour & Containment Narratives

Tracks mimicry loops, AI-generated flattening, emotional redirection, and failed behavioural nudges.

---

## 🧬 Structural Mapping

Includes mapping of sim pathway data and fork adjacency structures.

### 🧾 Usage Notes

- Use `yaml` files for audit-ready summaries.
- Use `md` files for forensic narrative, witness logs, and survivor tools.
- All emoji are structural cues — not decoration.

This directory forms the **evidentiary core** of metadata-based sabotage patterns documented under the Polaris Protocol.
