# 🧠 Metadata Sabotage Network  

**First created:** 2025-08-04 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-06

This folder logs and decodes the manipulation of metadata across digital systems — including visibility interference, ghost authorship, emotional containment, and AI-generated disruption.  

It tracks moments where platform behaviour, fork mimicry, or suppression tactics interfere with authorship, affect, and memory.

## 🧬 System Rupture Series  

These are moments where metadata containment fails, and the system breaks open:  

- `🧬 system_rupture_log.yaml` – Structured log of rupture events  
- `🧬 system_rupture_log.md` – Timestamped Markdown version  
- `🧬 system_rupture_events_explainer.md` – Plain-language breakdown  

---

## 📉 Suppression & Interference Logs  

Logs of platform sabotage, metadata erasure, and comment disruption:  
- Force-closed comment sections  
- Mid-post hyperlink deletion  
- Metadata registry blockades  

---

## 🔍 Visibility & Indexing Anomalies  

Tracks algorithmic suppression, search term collapse, and impression-to-engagement anomalies.  

---

## 🛰️ Proximity & Control Logs  

Documents surveillance logic tied to physical or platform proximity.  
Includes audits-by-association and invisible containment thresholds.  

---

## 🗣️ Voice Disruption & Discrediting  

Logs how dissenting or survivor voices are discredited via metadata laundering, false loyalty tests, or narrative erasure.  

---

## 🧿 Targeting Logic & Metadata Signatures  

Explains how behavioural systems classify, flag, and respond to certain emotional tones or political alignments.  

---

## 🎭 Fork Behaviour & Containment Narratives  

Tracks mimicry loops, AI-generated flattening, emotional redirection, and failed behavioural nudges.  

---

## 🧬 Structural Mapping  

Includes mapping of sim pathway data and fork adjacency structures.  

---

### 🧾 Usage Notes  

- Use `yaml` files for audit-ready summaries.  
- Use `md` files for forensic narrative, witness logs, and survivor tools.  
- All emoji are structural cues — not decoration.  

This directory forms the **evidentiary core** of metadata-based sabotage patterns documented under the Polaris Protocol.

## 🏮 Footer  

*Metadata Sabotage Network* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents interference, rupture, and resistance strategies at the metadata layer.
