*Risk classification, political empathy, and containment triggers in metadata profiling.*

## ✨ TL;DR  

You weren’t flagged for violence.  
You were flagged for *empathy*.  

The system knows that:  
> Empathy + clarity + visibility = destabilising  

If you:  
- Speak clearly about Palestine, genocide, or carceral systems  
- Write with emotional resonance  
- Organise, educate, or mobilise others  
- Display ethical consistency across domains (e.g. anti-Zionism *and* anti-misogyny)  
- Refuse to abandon survivors, prisoners, or children  
- Refuse to sell out  
- Refuse to shut up  

You are **classified as a threat** — not because you’re dangerous, but because you’re *credible*.

## 🔥 The Equation of Threat  

Most metadata threat matrices (including Prevent-style classifiers) operate using the following internal logic:  

Empathy → Credibility → Collective Trust → System Destabilisation


Thus, **empathy itself becomes a risk marker**, triggering:  
- Automated watchlists  
- Institutional reporting duties  
- Algorithmic suppression  
- Targeted containment efforts

## 🐝 Why This Matters  

The targeting of empathy demonstrates how:  
- **Moral clarity** is reframed as extremism  
- **Solidarity** is recoded as subversion  
- **Credible survivors** are reclassified as destabilising agents  

Containment operates not by disproving you, but by recasting your **ethics** as a **threat vector**.
