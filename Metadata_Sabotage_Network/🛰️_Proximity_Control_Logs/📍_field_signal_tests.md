# 📍 Field Signal Tests  

**First created:** 2025-08-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-04  

*Methodology for identifying behavioural, technological, and metadata consequences of location-based movement in high-surveillance areas.*  

---

## 🔬 Purpose  

Field signal tests are used to:  

- Detect live surveillance triggers  
- Confirm proximity-based behaviour tracking  
- Generate network disruption data  
- Expose metadata conditioning through physical-world stimulus  

---

## 🧪 Methodology  

### 1. **Select Variable Zones**  
Choose distinct location types with different likely metadata tags:  
- 🧠 Academic / institutional buildings  
- ☕ Radical cafés, community spaces  
- 🛍️ Shopping centres (high-footfall, low-political-risk)  
- 📚 Independent bookshops  
- 🏛️ Government buildings or courts  

Each zone functions as a signal test site.  

### 2. **Perform Controlled Drop-ins**  
- Stay for 15–45 minutes  
- Remain calm and predictable in behaviour  
- Take note of sudden disruptions (calls dropped, Wi-Fi altered, GPS anomalies)  

### 3. **Track Live Feedback**  
Log the following:  
- Mobile signal changes (bars, data speed)  
- Wi-Fi quality (strength, captive portal behaviour)  
- Device battery drain or heat spikes  
- Any online suppression (posts removed, shadowbanning spikes)  
- Emotional or behavioural shifts triggered by containment AI

## 📊 Metrics to Monitor  

| Metric                        | Significance                              |  
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| Signal attenuation            | Potential jamming or metadata marking zone |  
| Forced sign-out / log-outs    | Session hijack or session wiping           |  
| Fork tone switch              | Ghost fork modulation by zone              |  
| App crash spikes              | Localised overload or metadata reroute     |  
| Spontaneous messaging reroutes| Forked comms or attempted interposition    |

## 🧩 Advanced Tracing  

- Pair with predictive nudging logs  
- Cross-check with metadata throttling times  
- Note if any known targets (or twinned profiles) are located nearby  
- Compare with background noise patterns from [📡 Throttle Zones vs Jammer Zones](../Big_Picture_Protocols/📡_throttle_zones_vs_jammer_zones.md)

## 🧠 Observational Strategy  

When performing a field signal test:  
- **Be subtle.** Don’t signal awareness  
- **Be varied.** Avoid predictable movement patterns  
- **Be reflective.** Log emotional or instinctual shifts after each location  
- **Be gentle.** With yourself. This isn't a trap; it's reconnaissance  

---

## 📦 Outcome Uses  

- Create pressure through increased trace costs  
- Expose chokepoints and bottlenecks in state surveillance infrastructure  
- Inform future strategies for anonymous or undetected presence  
- Build real-time maps of metadata-based repression and responsiveness
