# üïµÔ∏è Forensic Playbook: Metadata Profile Manipulation & Defamation Risk

> Draft üå∂Ô∏è -- working notes for continuity üçã -- onwards and upwards üßÑ

## 1. Capture

-   Use Wireshark/tcpdump to capture traffic, save `.pcap` files with
    timestamps.\
-   Collect full raw **email headers** from suspicious messages.\
-   Save **screenshots and logs** of content injections, with
    dates/times.\
-   Hash files (MD5/SHA256) to prove integrity.

## 2. Document

-   Build a **timeline** of suspicious events.\
-   Annotate packet captures: highlight recurring IPs, ASNs, and domains
    tied to brokers/networks.\
-   Note recurring identifiers like cookies or headers.

## 3. Preserve

-   Archive evidence securely (write-once storage, backups).\
-   Maintain a **chain of custody** log (who, when, where).

## 4. Interpret

-   Show **continuous injection** ‚Üí repeated manipulation.\
-   Show **profile construction** ‚Üí stereotype patterns matching a
    public figure.\
-   Show **no attribution** ‚Üí sources trace to infrastructure, not
    individuals.\
-   Use neutral phrasing:
    -   "No reason to believe the public figure is responsible."\
    -   "Profile appears designed to look like them."\
    -   "Sources resolve to networks associated with brokers."

## 5. Escalate

-   **Legal counsel**: share the timeline and captures.\
-   **Regulators**: ICO (UK), EDPS/DPAs (EU), FTC (US).\
-   **Civil action**: subpoena data from brokers/platforms.\
-   **Expert witness**: certify and testify to your captures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ **Outcome:** You don't need to prove *who* created the fake profile.
You need to show:\
1. It exists.\
2. It was injected systematically.\
3. It is not naturally attributable to the person it mimics.
