# 📍 Field Signal Tests

**Objective:**  
To identify the behavioural, technological, and metadata consequences of real-world location-based movement, particularly in high-surveillance areas. This document outlines a method of field testing signal stability, metadata reactions, and narrative responses to physical presence in mapped zones.

---

## 🔬 Purpose

Field signal tests are used to:

- Detect live surveillance triggers.
- Confirm proximity-based behaviour tracking.
- Generate network disruption data.
- Expose metadata conditioning through physical-world stimulus.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. **Select Variable Zones**
Choose distinct location types with different likely metadata tags:
- 🧠 Academic / institutional buildings  
- ☕ Radical cafés, community spaces  
- 🛍️ Shopping centres (high-footfall, low-political-risk)  
- 📚 Independent bookshops  
- 🏛️ Government buildings or courts  

Each zone functions as a signal test site.

### 2. **Perform Controlled Drop-ins**
- Stay for 15–45 minutes.
- Remain calm and predictable in behaviour.
- Take note of sudden disruptions (calls dropped, Wi-Fi altered, GPS anomalies).

### 3. **Track Live Feedback**
Log the following:
- Mobile signal changes (bars, data speed).
- Wi-Fi quality (strength, captive portal behaviour).
- Device battery drain or heat spikes.
- Any online suppression (posts removed, shadowbanning spikes).
- Emotional or behavioural shifts triggered by containment AI.

## 📊 Metrics to Monitor

| Metric                      | Significance                        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Signal attenuation         | Potential jamming or metadata marking zone |
| Forced sign-out/log-outs   | Session hijack or session wiping   |
| Fork tone switch           | Ghost fork modulation by zone      |
| App crash spikes           | Localised overload or metadata reroute |
| Spontaneous messaging reroutes | Forked comms or attempted interposition |

---

## 🧩 Advanced Tracing

- Pair with predictive nudging logs.
- Cross-check with metadata throttling times.
- Note if any known targets (or twinned profiles) are located nearby.
- Compare with background noise patterns from **📡 throttle_zones_vs_jammer_zones.md**.

## 🧠 Observational Strategy

When performing a field signal test:
- **Be subtle.** Don’t signal awareness.
- **Be varied.** Avoid predictable movement patterns.
- **Be reflective.** Log emotional or instinctual shifts after each location.
- **Be gentle.** With yourself. This isn't a trap; it's reconnaissance.

---

## 📦 Outcome Uses

- Create pressure through increased trace costs.
- Expose chokepoints and bottlenecks in state surveillance infrastructure.
- Inform future strategies for anonymous or undetected presence.
- Build real-time maps of metadata-based repression and responsiveness.
