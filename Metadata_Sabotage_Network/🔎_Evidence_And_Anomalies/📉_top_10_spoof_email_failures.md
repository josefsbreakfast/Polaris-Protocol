## 🛰️ Orientation
Despite surface variation, spoofed emails fail in remarkably consistent ways.

This node lists the ten most common failures observed across low-skill impersonation attempts, ordered by diagnostic usefulness rather than frequency.

## ✨ Key Features
- Pattern repetition across unrelated incidents  
- Failures visible without advanced tooling  
- Errors that escalate rather than conceal  
- Psychological tells embedded in text

## 🧿 Analysis

### 1. **Unnecessary Specificity**
Details no real sender would include.

### 2. **Tone Drift**
Emotional register inconsistent with the claimed author.

### 3. **Authority Inflation**
Overstated power, certainty, or moral judgement.

### 4. **Temporal Sloppiness**
Timelines that don’t align with real processes.

### 5. **Projection Leakage**
Accusations that mirror the sender’s insecurities.

### 6. **Misused Terminology**
Words that sound right but aren’t used correctly.

### 7. **Formatting Oddities**
Inconsistent signatures, spacing, or structure.

### 8. **Contextual Ignorance**
Failure to understand how real systems operate.

### 9. **Escalation Where None Is Warranted**
Immediate severity without procedural grounding.

### 10. **The Fatal Flourish**
A line so revealing it reframes the entire message as autobiography.
