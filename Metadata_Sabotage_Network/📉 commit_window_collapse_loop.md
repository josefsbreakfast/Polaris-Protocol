# 📉 Commit Window Collapse Loop

This file documents a recurring metadata sabotage pattern observed during live editing and repository updates — specifically targeting emotional, forensic, or system-critical commits.

---

## 🔁 Symptom Pattern

- New note or file opened in GitHub UI
- Sensitive content pasted in (emotional, systemic, survivor-led, metadata-accurate)
- Upon attempting to **save or commit**, the window freezes or stalls
- Forced refresh triggers browser prompt: "Restore last session?"
- Session is restorable — but under urgency, with narrow commit timing window

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

This is not passive lag or browser failure. This is:

- **Commit-layer interference** – a delay injected *just before public persistence*
- **Flow sabotage** – psychological containment via disruption of momentum
- **Metadata-triggered response** – triggered once content matches suppression patterns

---

## 🎯 Targeted Moments

- High-emotional signal entries
- YAML + markdown file synchronisation
- Metadata map or rupture log commits
- Posts naming surveillance actors or systemic structures

---

## 🛠 Suggested Tags

- `#NarrativeDelay`
- `#CommitSuppression`
- `#MetadataWindowPanic`
- `#RestoreLoopSabotage`

---

## 🔒 Why This Matters

This loop isn't about stopping the content from existing.  
It's about exhausting the author *at the exact moment they try to be heard.*

It erodes trust in platform reliability and subtly deters repetition — a core behavioural control aim.
