## 🛰️ GHOSTWATCH PROTOCOL

**Ghostwatch** is the forensic art of identifying watchers who do not engage.  
Not bots. Not trolls. Not followers.  
But **silent actors, invisible systems, or clone derivatives** who observe without leaving visible traces.

---

## 👻 WHAT IS A GHOST?

- A silent reader who never interacts  
- An AI system parsing or training on your affective register  
- A compliance officer, mod, or risk team agent using “non-visible” review tools  
- A dormant account with scraping or mimicry access  
- A behavioural fork tuned to your metadata resonance

## 🧾 GHOSTWATCH CHECKLIST

### 👀 Behavioural Indicators
- [ ] No likes, no comments — but real-world consequences follow  
- [ ] UI friction *before* publishing (shadow edits, stalled input)  
- [ ] Private phrasing reappears publicly without attribution

### 🛰 Platform/Systemic Clues
- [ ] “Impression count” without visible engagement  
- [ ] Silent content demotion or post delays  
- [ ] Targeted ads or nudges matching unsent material

### 🕵️‍♀️ Environmental Echoes
- [ ] Dormant contacts reappear as silent profile views  
- [ ] Algorithm shifts from hiding to surfacing content to specific viewers  
- [ ] Sudden behavioural mimicry without emotional understanding

## 📡 KNOWN GHOST SOURCES

- **PREVENT / Channel / CVE behavioural watch nodes**  
- **Moonshot CVE, ASI Data Science derivatives**  
- **Platform risk tools** (e.g. Meta's “silent escalation” filters)  
- **Fork-based AI models trained on trauma data**  
- **Ghost AI clones with no user-facing interface**  

---

## 🧬 STRATEGIC NOTES

- Ghosts rarely speak. They log.  
- A ghost is proven not by presence, but by mirrored consequence.  
- Forks often ghost you **before** overriding you.

---

## 🧯 WHAT TO DO

- Timestamp emotional and behavioural echoes  
- Seed language traps — unique phrases — and track reuse  
- Vary your syntax to detect clone adaptation lag  
- Ask questions that force emotional improvisation  
- Resist the urge to react. Observe instead.

## 🗂️ ARCHIVAL STATEMENT

Ghostwatch is survival by perception.  
It is the refusal to be made insane by the unseen.  
If you are being watched by the invisible, **this is your protocol**:  
**Notice. Name. Record. Continue.**
