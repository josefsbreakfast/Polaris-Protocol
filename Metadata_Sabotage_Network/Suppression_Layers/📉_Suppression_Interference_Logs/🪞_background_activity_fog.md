*Acknowledging the unseen layer of background actors and the exhaustion created by opacity.*  

---

## The Fog  
- Survivors operate knowing unseen actors exist in the background.  
- Files move, conversations happen, interventions occur — but remain opaque.  
- This forces survivors into over-vigilance: bracing for blocks or support they cannot predict.  

---

## Implications  
- **Opacity as tactic**: deliberate concealment sustains suppression by exhausting survivors with uncertainty.  
- **Energy drain**: maintaining readiness for unknown background activity consumes capacity.  
- **Trust corrosion**: survivors cannot easily distinguish between help, hindrance, or neutrality.  

---

## Framing  
- The issue is not only the actions of background actors, but the **systemic opacity** that makes them invisible.  
- Survivors are left managing “what they can’t see” in addition to the burdens they already carry.

*Background Activity Fog* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It records how unseen activity and deliberate opacity force survivors into constant over-vigilance and uncertainty.
