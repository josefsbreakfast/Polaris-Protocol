# 📉 Suppression Interference Logs  
**First created:** 2025-09-04  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*Commit failures, forced comment closures, UI sabotage, and other live traces of containment in action*

---

## Purpose
To serve as the **black box recorder** for metadata sabotage.  
This node collects first-hand logs of interference events—technical or procedural—that affect publishing, communication, or visibility.  
It turns ephemeral glitches into evidence and patterns.

---

## Core Premise
Most suppression does not announce itself; it manifests as small, deniable failures.  
Comment boxes greyed out, uploads stalling, commits disappearing, UI elements shifting.  
Individually they look like bugs; together they map an intentional architecture of friction.

---

## What to Log
| Event Type | Description | Example Manifestations |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Commit Failures** | Content saves, pushes, or uploads blocked without clear error. | Git push returns success but files absent on remote. |
| **Forced Comment Closures** | Threads automatically locked or replies disabled. | “Commenting closed due to unusual activity” on live issues. |
| **UI Sabotage** | Buttons hidden, options greyed out, or forms reset. | Publish button disappears when flagged keywords present. |
| **Shadow Edits** | Content altered or truncated after submission without notification. | Links stripped from posts, titles auto-rewritten. |
| **Analytics Drift** | Reach/engagement metrics inconsistent with known audience. | 10k followers but 0 impressions on fresh post. |

## How to Log
- **Timestamp (UTC):** exact time interference occurred.  
- **Platform / System:** where the event happened.  
- **Action Attempted:** what you were trying to do.  
- **Observed Outcome:** what actually happened (include screenshots if possible).  
- **Context:** any unusual factors (keywords, topic, tags, prior flags).  
- **Version Info:** app version, browser, device, or commit hash.  

Use consistent markdown or CSV so entries can be aggregated and analysed.

## Analytical Questions
1. Do these events cluster around particular topics, keywords, or actors?  
2. Are failures time-synchronised across platforms or geographies?  
3. Can UI sabotage be linked to A/B testing, policy rollout, or manual intervention?  
4. Which vendors provide the moderation or analytics back-end?  
5. How can we differentiate ordinary bugs from targeted suppression?

## Research Threads
- Building a timeline of interference incidents for pattern recognition.  
- Cross-referencing logs with policy changes or media coverage.  
- Developing open-source tools to automate anomaly detection.  
- Legal exploration of whether covert throttling breaches consumer or speech rights.  
- Survivor diaries capturing the lived experience of “invisible barriers.”  

---

## Counter-Responses
- **Independent Analytics:** external tracking of reach and post integrity.  
- **Redundant Channels:** duplicate critical posts across multiple platforms.  
- **Checksum Publishing:** cryptographic hashes for content to prove alteration.  
- **Public Reporting:** anonymised dashboards showing suppression spikes.  
- **Policy Engagement:** using aggregated logs to demand transparency from platforms.

*📉 Suppression Interference Logs* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents one layer of metadata sabotage and its counter-responses—turning glitches into a map of containment.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
