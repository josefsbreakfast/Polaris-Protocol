# 🧬 Echo Script Templates & Chain Ledger Specification  
**First created:** 2025-11-18 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-22  
*Reusable templates for structured repetition, attribution fidelity, and distributed verification under suppression conditions.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node defines the **Echo Script**: a set of templates and logging practices for maintaining message integrity, visibility, and attribution when communications are subject to suppression, distortion, or decay.

An echo is not spam.  
It is **careful repetition with memory**.

Echo scripts are designed for environments where:
- messages fragment,
- testimony drifts,
- or visibility is selectively throttled.

They turn repetition into **infrastructure**, not noise.

---

## ✨ Key Ideas  

### 1. Repetition Can Be Protective  
When signals are degraded, repeating *the same thing clearly* preserves meaning better than constant novelty.

### 2. Fidelity Beats Reach  
Echo scripts prioritise:
- wording stability,
- attribution clarity,
- and temporal traceability  
over raw amplification.

### 3. Memory Is a Collective Task  
Chain ledgers ensure no single node carries the full burden of recall, proof, or persistence.

---

## 📄 Templates Included  

### 🧾 Echo Register Template  
A structured log of:
- original statement,
- authorised variants,
- timestamps,
- and known reposts.

Purpose: prevent semantic drift while allowing controlled adaptation.

---

### 🪞 Mirror-Note Schema  
A lightweight annotation format attached to each echo, recording:
- who echoed,
- where,
- with what contextual framing.

Purpose: maintain provenance without central control.

---

### ⛓️ Chain Ledger (YAML Specification)  
A human- and machine-readable ledger tracking:
- message lineage,
- forks and merges,
- corrections and withdrawals.

Purpose: create auditable continuity under interference.

---

### 🗓️ Synchronous Echo Planning Sheet  
A coordination aid for:
- timed releases,
- staggered echoes,
- and redundancy planning.

Purpose: sustain visibility without triggering rate-based suppression.

---

## 🛠️ Use Cases  

Echo scripts are appropriate when:

### 🪧 Protest & Mobilisation  
- slogans must remain consistent across sites,
- language must survive media reframing,
- and organisers cannot rely on a single channel.

### 🧠 Safeguarding Distributed Testimony  
- multiple witnesses echo the same account,
- attribution must remain intact,
- and erasure or doubt is anticipated.

### 🧭 Preventing Semantic Drift  
- policy language is being softened,
- commitments are being reworded,
- or harm is being euphemised over time.

Echo scripts stabilise meaning when environments are hostile to clarity.

---

## 🧪 What Echo Scripts Are Not  

They are **not**:
- botnets,
- astroturfing,
- coercive messaging,
- or volume-based manipulation.

Key differences:
- human-in-the-loop confirmation,
- visible provenance,
- explicit versioning,
- and consent to echo.

Repetition without care is noise.  
Repetition with care is memory.

---

## 🧬 Interaction with Suppression  

Echo scripts counter:

- **Visibility throttling** → by redundancy.  
- **Narrative substitution** → by wording stability.  
- **Attribution erosion** → by chain logging.  

They do not defeat suppression.  
They **outlast** it.

---

## 🧪 Failure Modes & Safeguards  

### Risks  
- message fossilisation,
- performative repetition,
- burnout of echo participants.

### Safeguards  
- sunset clauses on scripts,
- explicit “do not echo” conditions,
- rotation of custodians,
- withdrawal protocols when facts change.

An echo that cannot stop becomes containment itself.

*🧬 Echo Script Templates & Chain Ledger Specification* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents practical methods for preserving meaning, attribution, and continuity when communications are degraded by suppression or interference.
