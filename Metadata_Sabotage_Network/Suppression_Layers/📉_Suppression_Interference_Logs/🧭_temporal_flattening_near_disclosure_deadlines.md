## 🛰️ Orientation  

This log documents a repeating four-week cycle often felt in the run-up to statutory disclosure points.  

Pattern noted:  
1️⃣ **Week 1 — Impact:** overt disruption or agitation; visible interference.  
2️⃣ **Week 2 — Emotional recursion:** narrative or “love-story” fixation; affective confusion.  
3️⃣ **Week 3 — Flattening:** energy drop, procedural calm, sense of time dilation.  
4️⃣ **Week 4 — Deadline proximity:** attention diffused, external correspondence slows.

## 🧾 Field Notes  

*(Use short dated entries; fragments are fine.)*  

| Date | Observation | Emotional tone | External trigger / note |
|------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 2025-10-14 | Escalation — “cack-handed repeat” of prior tactic. | Shocked, bemused | Early FOIA contact. |
| 2025-10-21 | “Love-story” motif re-introduced; narrative not cohesive. | Confused, detached | Online pattern repetition. |

## 🪞 Reflections  

- How does **tempo** shift across the month?  
- Where do you feel the **flattening** most strongly (body, focus, communication)?  
- What restores rhythm or agency, even briefly?

## 🧮 Forensic Logging — Micro-Distortions and Drift  

Over this cycle, a pattern has emerged around subtle textual or tonal alterations.  
After clearing the `gitintakedraw` folder two weeks before the FOIA deadline, new fragments began to accumulate again — small notes, partial drafts, and near-duplicates of existing nodes.  

The changes are rarely obvious.  
Instead of whole deletions or crashes, there are **micro-tweaks**: a word replaced, a phrase softened, a key connector removed.  
Each is small enough to pass unnoticed, yet together they **tilt meaning** and **flatten affect**.  

Common signs:  
- Dictation outputs that alter phrasing during transcription.  
- Versions where emotionally charged sentences become placating or neutral.  
- Continuous, almost invisible edits that make a survivor’s account sound less precise or less certain.  

These are worth logging not as proof of any single event but as **pattern evidence** of containment logic at work.  
Each small drift can be timestamped and archived beside the original.  
Even minimal variance, tracked across time, reveals the system’s preference for calm over clarity.
