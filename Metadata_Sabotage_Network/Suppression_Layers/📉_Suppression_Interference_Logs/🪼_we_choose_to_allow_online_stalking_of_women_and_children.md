# 🪼 We choose to allow online stalking of women and children  
**First created:** 2025-12-29 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-01  
*On the deliberate tolerance of digitally legible harm.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  
This node documents a structural choice, not a technical failure: the routine tolerance of online stalking and harassment of women and children despite its clear detectability through existing metadata systems.

The behaviour is visible. The signals are legible. The inaction is deliberate.

## 🧿 Analysis  

Online stalking is not subtle. It produces repeatable, machine-readable signatures:  
timing convergence, proximity clustering, linguistic reuse, cross-platform shadowing, and persistence over time.

These same indicators are routinely used to detect spam, fraud, and political coordination.  
When the targets are women or children, those signals are reframed as “engagement,” “conflict,” or “drama.”

This is not a tooling gap.  
It is an incentive choice.

The downgrade of stalking into “normal internet behaviour” functions as a containment mechanism:  
- credibility erosion  
- forced individualisation (“just block”)  
- denial of systemic pattern recognition  

The result is predictable: harm continues, responsibility diffuses, and perpetrators gain structural cover.

## 🔥 What this node asserts  

- Online stalking is **already detectable at scale**  
- Platforms **already possess the analytic capacity** to identify it  
- Failure to act represents **governance choice**, not ignorance  
- The burden of proof is unfairly shifted onto survivors  
- Children are exposed through the same permissive logic

## 🥀 A Rose By Any Other Name...  

If the same metadata patterns appeared around:
	-	a corporation
	-	a politician
	-	a military asset
	-	a financial system

…we call the behaviour targeting, hostile reconnaissance, or influence operations.

When it happens to women, it’s called:

“online behaviour”.  

We are downgraded, as are children, not due to logic or analysis, but simply because qualifying tye behaviour as adversary would make some men uncomfortable.  

This avoidance of discomfort to the rich straight white male repeats through the acceptance of online harrassment of any and all marginalised people and our digital experiences.  

The great minds of men believe in the absolute authority of quantifiable data...  

Until accountability rests with them.  

The problem gets reframed as somehow the nature of data, and they pray that the world moves on.

## 🏮 Footer  

*We choose to allow online stalking of women and children* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It records a systemic decision point where detectable harm is normalised rather than prevented.
