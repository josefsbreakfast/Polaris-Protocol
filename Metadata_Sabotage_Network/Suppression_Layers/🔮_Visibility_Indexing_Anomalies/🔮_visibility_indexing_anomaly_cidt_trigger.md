# 🔮 Visibility indexing anomaly: CIDT trigger  
**First created:** 2025-12-14 | **Last updated:** 2025-12-14  
*How specific legal framings alter indexing, routing, and attention patterns.*

---

## 🛰️ Orientation  

This node describes **visibility indexing anomalies** that occur when content crosses a semantic threshold — particularly when it enters **regulated or legally sensitive language domains**.

Certain terms function as **indexing triggers**, altering how material is surfaced, reviewed, or circulated.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- Sudden visibility changes after specific terminology  
- Disproportionate attention relative to audience size  
- Interest from non-public-facing actors  
- Shifts in indexing or discovery pathways  

---

## 🧿 Analysis  

### 1. What an indexing anomaly is  

An indexing anomaly occurs when:
> **content visibility changes sharply without a corresponding change in audience size or promotion**

This often follows the introduction of:
- legal classifications  
- regulatory terms  
- human-rights language  
- duty-of-care framings  

---

### 2. Why CIDT functions as a trigger  

CIDT terminology sits at the intersection of:
- human rights law  
- institutional duty of care  
- reputational liability  

As a result, systems treat it as **high-salience language**, prompting:
- secondary review  
- internal circulation  
- or automated flagging  

---

### 3. Visibility ≠ amplification  

An indexing anomaly does not mean content is being promoted.

It means:
> **the content has entered a monitored semantic lane**

Visibility increases because *review pathways* activate — not because of popularity.

---

### 4. Why this matters  

Indexing anomalies reveal:
- what language systems are sensitive to  
- where governance thresholds lie  
- how attention is routed invisibly  

They expose **the contours of institutional listening**.

*Visibility indexing anomaly: CIDT trigger* is a living node of the **Polaris Protocol**.  
It documents how specific legal framings alter attention and review behaviour without public amplification.
