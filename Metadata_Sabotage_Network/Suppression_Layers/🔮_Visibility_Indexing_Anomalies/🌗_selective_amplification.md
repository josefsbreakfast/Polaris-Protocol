# 🌗 Selective Amplification  
**First created:** 2026-01-18 | **Last updated:** 2026-01-18  
*How moral shock is unevenly amplified to shape outrage, urgency, and political action — without altering underlying harm.*  

---

## 🛰️ Orientation

This node examines **selective amplification**: the patterned elevation of some morally shocking events while others of comparable severity are muted, delayed, or fragmented.

The mechanism does not require falsification. It operates through **asymmetrical volume, timing, repetition, and framing**.

Moral shock becomes a managed resource rather than a spontaneous response.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Defines moral shock as a governable signal
* Shows how amplification shapes urgency without changing facts
* Distinguishes amplification from accuracy
* Connects emotional salience to policy momentum
* Links selective shock to alliance and platform incentives

---

## 🌗 What Is Being Amplified

Selective amplification targets:

* emotionally arresting imagery
* individualised victim stories
* symbolic atrocities
* moments that condense complex harm into a single scene

These elements travel faster and trigger stronger reactions.

---

## 🧠 Moral Shock as Signal

Moral shock functions as:

* a trigger for attention
* a justification for rapid response
* a cue for moral alignment
* a permission structure for force or restraint

When shock is amplified, action feels necessary.
When it is dampened, delay feels reasonable.

---

## 📡 Amplification Controls

Selective amplification is shaped by:

* editorial prioritisation
* algorithmic ranking
* repetition across outlets
* influencer and official uptake
* platform moderation asymmetries

Silence is rarely total.
It is **relative**.

---

## ⚖️ Governance Consequences

Uneven amplification of moral shock leads to:

* accelerated intervention in some cases
* prolonged inaction in others
* distorted public understanding of scale
* moral fatigue through over-concentration
* selective empathy normalisation

Outrage is not depleted.
It is **reallocated**.

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Signals

Selective amplification is present when:

* comparable atrocities receive different urgency
* shock spikes early for some actors and late for others
* repetition substitutes for new information
* framing intensifies without factual escalation
* policy shifts track emotion rather than evidence

These indicate signal management, not randomness.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Framing

* **Moral shock** = emotional activation
* **Amplification** = governance lever
* **Selectivity** = power signal

Ask not only what shocked people — but **why this shock travelled**.
