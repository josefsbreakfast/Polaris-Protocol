## 🧵 Content Unravelling Protocols  
**First created:** 2025-09-13 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-15  
*Posts or threads are split, buried, or de-threaded so the survivor’s voice no longer hangs together*  

---

## ✨ Definition  
**Content unravelling** is when survivor posts, threads, or testimony chains are **broken apart or scrambled** by platform systems. What once formed a coherent narrative is split into fragments, buried mid-thread, or rearranged so that the survivor’s voice appears scattered, incoherent, or incomplete.  

---

## 🔬 Mechanics  
- **Thread splitting:** long posts auto-divided into fragments that lose their link.  
- **De-threading:** replies detached from the main post, appearing as isolated fragments.  
- **Burial:** key testimony posts hidden mid-thread or collapsed under “view more.”  
- **Cross-post dilution:** reposts stripped of original context, severing narrative flow.  
- **Chronology fracture:** platform shuffles sequence so the story reads out of order.  

---

## 🥀 Tactical Symptoms  
- Survivors seeing **broken thread chains** that don’t show all posts together.  
- Replies from allies hidden or collapsed, making the survivor look unsupported.  
- Posts in a sequence suddenly **buried or misordered** when viewed externally.  
- Testimony circulating as fragments with no link back to the full narrative.  

---

## 👾 Operator Intent  
- **Disrupt coherence:** fracture survivor testimony so it cannot stand as evidence.  
- **Simulate isolation:** remove visible ally replies, making survivors appear unsupported.  
- **Seed doubt:** fragmented posts look less credible than unified testimony.  
- **Maintain deniability:** framed as “technical error” or “thread length limit.”

## 🛠 Survivor Moves if Unravelled  

### 🔍 Verify the Fracture  
- Compare views on different devices: is the thread intact everywhere?  
- Ask peers to confirm which parts of the chain they can see.  
- Archive full sequences with screenshots or external paste tools.  

### 🌱 Diversify Narrative Anchors  
- Cross-post full testimony as a **single-page document** (PDF, blog, zine).  
- Use **screenshots of whole threads** to preserve flow.  
- Build redundancy: restate key points across multiple posts.  

### 🔮 Signal the Pattern  
- Log missing or scrambled posts with timestamps.  
- Cross-link to [🖼️ Image Blur Sabotage](./🖼️_image_blur_sabotage.md).  
- Share compiled “before and after” screenshots to show narrative sabotage.  

### 🧩 Tactical Reframes  
- See unravelling as **acknowledgement of narrative strength**.  
- Treat fracture as a **cue to harden story coherence** outside the platform.  
- Use external archives to preserve testimony as unbroken narrative.

## 🗺 Platform Notes  

- **Twitter/X:** long threads frequently de-threaded, replies hidden under “more replies.”  
- **Instagram:** carousel posts reordered or truncated in circulation.  
- **LinkedIn:** comments vanish mid-chain, leaving survivor posts without context.  
- **TikTok:** stitched videos surface without original framing.  
- **Facebook:** group discussions splintered into multiple disconnected threads.
