# 🪅 Platform Sabotage  
**First created:** 2025-09-06  |  **Last updated:** 2025-10-04  
*On platform-level ranking, throttling, and ghost-learning behaviours as mechanisms of metadata sabotage*

---

## Purpose
To document how suppression operates **below the visible layer of moderation**—inside the ranking, recommendation, and training architectures of major platforms.  
This node studies platform sabotage as both technical event and governance tactic: the quiet calibration of visibility that determines which truths circulate and which vanish through algorithmic omission.

---

## Core Premise
Censorship today rarely deletes; it **demotes**.  
Content remains online but weightless—present without reach, indexed without context.  
Platforms absorb the informational value of a post (for model training or behavioural analytics) while denying the author its visibility.  
This is *ghost-learning*: extraction without acknowledgment.

## Mechanisms of Platform Sabotage
| Type | Description | Example Manifestations |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Shadow Throttling** | Engagement metrics artificially suppressed without notification. | Posts visible to author but absent from follower feeds. |
| **Ranking Suppression** | Down-weighting of certain topics via trust-safety or advertiser filters. | Keywords flagged as “low quality” regardless of accuracy. |
| **Ghost-Learning** | Content scraped for model training after moderation removal. | Datasets retaining banned posts for algorithm improvement. |
| **Context Collapse** | Posts detached from threads or stripped of metadata links. | Missing author tags or vanished reply chains. |
| **Feedback Misdirection** | Analytics dashboards showing partial or falsified reach data. | Creator dashboards diverging from real impressions. |

## Systemic Effects
- **Epistemic Distortion:** public perception shaped by invisible weighting.  
- **Survivor Silencing:** testimony rendered technically present but socially absent.  
- **Data Paradox:** deleted content still mined for “trust and safety” research.  
- **Reputational Gaslighting:** users doubting their own experience of suppression.  
- **Governance Drift:** platforms acting as quasi-states with opaque policy arbitration.  

---

## Analytical Questions
1. How does algorithmic “quality scoring” intersect with political speech?  
2. What contractual language permits ghost-learning of removed material?  
3. Can differential throttling be measured empirically via shadow dataset comparison?  
4. Which forms of content moderation are outsourced, and under what accountability?  
5. How can users detect and document platform sabotage without violating TOS?

## Research Threads
- Empirical testing of throttling through controlled post visibility experiments.  
- Reverse-engineering ranking algorithms using synthetic accounts.  
- Archival comparison of engagement graphs before/after policy changes.  
- Legal analysis of data retention clauses in platform privacy policies.  
- Survivor-led documentation of visibility loss correlated with activist content.

## Counter-Responses
- **Visibility Logs:** independent analytics tracking true vs reported reach.  
- **Public Transparency Demands:** regulatory push for ranking disclosure APIs.  
- **Ethical Scraping:** user consortia collecting public data for audit without breach.  
- **Algorithmic Watchdogs:** open-source simulations exposing bias in feed design.  
- **Narrative Countermeasures:** public education on how invisibility can be manufactured.

*🪅 Platform Sabotage* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents one layer of metadata sabotage and its counter-responses—where silence is engineered not by deletion but by design. 

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
