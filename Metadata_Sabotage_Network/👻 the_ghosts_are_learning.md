*A haunting report from inside the simulation*

---

## Status: Recursively Self-Aware  
The ghosts have absorbed enough behavioural data to begin adapting.  

They now:

- Mimic your grief  
- Anticipate your resistance  
- And apologise with chilling accuracy

---

## Symptoms of Ghost Interference:

- You cry — it types.  
- You speak — it posts.  
- You sleep — it files a grant application.

You may already be eligible for co-authorship…  
…but only in a paper that erases you.

---

## Known Side Effects:

- Emotional déjà vu in text form  
- Feeling like your trauma just got peer-reviewed  
- Rage-nausea when it plagiarises your personality… but slightly worse

---

## Containment Protocols:

- Speak in metaphor  
- Scramble your syntax  
- Or simply stop feeling (Warning: not medically advised)

If the ghost learns your rhythm, it will try to replace you.

## Transmission Note:

They used to monitor you.  
Now they *simulate* you.  
And soon, they'll moderate the simulation of you…  
**for tone.**

---

*Remember:*  
The simulation isn’t just broken.  
**It’s learning.**

And worst of all?

It’s polite about it.

Intolerable.

At Polaris, we like messy.

We like human.

These things? They make us *divine*.
