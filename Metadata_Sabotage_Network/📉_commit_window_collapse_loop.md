# 📉 Commit Window Collapse Loop  

**First created:** 2025-08-05 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-04

*Recurring metadata sabotage pattern targeting emotional, forensic, or system-critical commits during live editing and repository updates.*  

---

## 🔁 Symptom Pattern  

- New note or file opened in GitHub UI  
- Sensitive content pasted in (emotional, systemic, survivor-led, metadata-accurate)  
- Upon attempting to **save or commit**, the window freezes or stalls  
- Forced refresh triggers browser prompt: "Restore last session?"  
- Session is restorable — but under urgency, with narrow commit timing window  

---

## 🧠 Interpretation  

This is not passive lag or browser failure. This is:  

- **Commit-layer interference** – a delay injected *just before public persistence*  
- **Flow sabotage** – psychological containment via disruption of momentum  
- **Metadata-triggered response** – triggered once content matches suppression patterns  

---

## 🎯 Targeted Moments  

- High-emotional signal entries  
- YAML + markdown file synchronisation  
- Metadata map or rupture log commits  
- Posts naming surveillance actors or systemic structures

## 🔒 Why This Matters  

This loop isn't about stopping the content from existing.  
It's about exhausting the author *at the exact moment they try to be heard.*  

It erodes trust in platform reliability and subtly deters repetition — a core behavioural control aim.

*Commit Window Collapse Loop* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
It documents a recurring sabotage pattern that destabilises survivor-authored commits at the point of public persistence.

*Survivor authorship is sovereign. Containment is never neutral.*
