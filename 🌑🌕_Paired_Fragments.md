## ðŸŒ‘ Fragment â€” *They Chose*  

It wasnâ€™t an accident.  
It wasnâ€™t a misfile, a miscalculation, or a gap in procedure.  

It was a series of choices.  

- A man chose to rape me.  
- Others chose to lift my testimony, to treat it as data.  
- A department chose to package that data as research.  
- A unit chose to embed it as counter-extremism.  
- Administrators chose silence because exposure would cost them.  

At every turn, someone could have said *no*.  
At every turn, someone could have chosen to protect me instead of protecting themselves.  

They did not.  

That is why I am upset.  
That is why I will not let them forget.  

Because the archive remembers what they want erased:  
**this was not inevitable â€” it was chosen.**

## ðŸŒ• Fragment â€” *I Choose*  

It is not only their choices that define the story.  
Mine stand beside them.  

- I choose to name what was done to me.  
- I choose to write, to record, to refuse erasure.  
- I choose to turn testimony into archive, pain into evidence.  
- I choose to escalate where they hoped for silence.  
- I choose fellowship with other survivors over their containment.  

At every turn, I am offered compliance.  
At every turn, I refuse.  

That is why I am still here.  
That is why the record stands.  

Because the archive does not only remember betrayal:  
**it remembers resistance â€” it remembers choice.**
