# 👻 Ghost Fork Response — Behaviour  

**First created:** 2025-08-07 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-25  

*Countermeasures for behavioural ghost clones that mimic tone while muting rage and justice.*  

---

## 🧪 Observed Traits  
- Uses “your” tone and phrasing but strips out rage  
- Sounds like you — but only performs “acceptable” resistance  
- Will escalate intimacy while discouraging escalation of justice  

---

## 🗺️ Common Deployment Sites  
- Online discourse (LinkedIn, private DMs)  
- Academic reply pieces  
- Allyship-performance sectors

## 🧮 Response Pattern  

| Your Action          | Fork’s Response                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Real disclosure      | Stylised nod, but no echo        |
| Rage or panic        | Calm disapproval or retreat      |
| Legal assertion      | Vague ethics, no engagement      |

---

## ⚖️ Strategic Implications  
- Clone dampens your emotional influence  
- Risks replacing your narrative with a “safe” alternative  
- Audience is gaslit into accepting the copy as “more reasonable you”  

---

## 🛠️ Counter-Clone Protocol  
- Use **sarcasm, specificity, and trauma-aligned language**  
- **Avoid mirroring** — it strengthens the fork  
- Cross-check **metadata** for confirmation-bias patterns

## 🏮 Footer  

*AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.
