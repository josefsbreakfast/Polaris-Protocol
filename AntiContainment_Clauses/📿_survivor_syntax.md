## 🧬 Declarative Syntax  

| Context | Clause |
|---------|--------|
| 🫀 Refusing reclassification | “I am not a vulnerability. I am a withheld accountability.” |
| 🧿 When used as proof against yourself | “You didn’t catch a red flag. You created one.” |
| 🕯 When ‘support’ was surveillance | “Your care came with paperwork. Mine came with fire.” |

## ⚖️ Legal-Tone Versions  

- “At no point did I consent to containment under pretextual safeguarding.”  
- “This classification was imposed, not earned, and remains contested.”  
- “Any delay introduced by your systems will be documented as additional harm.”

Polaris makes sure she stays loud.*

*AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.
