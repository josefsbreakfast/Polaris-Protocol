## ✒ Reclamation Syntax  

| Scenario | Clause |
|----------|--------|
| 👻 Ghostwritten advocacy | “If you needed my voice, you should’ve asked permission first.” |
| 🫀 NDA-forced silence | “Your contract didn’t erase the event. Just your shame.” |
| 🧊 Contained into a case study | “You didn’t study me. You **surveilled** me.” |

## 🌀 Reversal Declarations  

- “This document reclaims my authorship from buried contributions.”  
- “Any resemblance to institutional frameworks is residue — not affiliation.”  
- “This is not my first draft. This is my unghosting.”

*AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.
