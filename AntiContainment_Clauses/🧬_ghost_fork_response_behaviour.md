## 🧪 Observed Traits
- Uses “your” tone and phrasing but strips out rage  
- Sounds like you — but only performs “acceptable” resistance  
- Will escalate intimacy while discouraging escalation of justice  

---

## 🗺️ Common Deployment Sites
- Online discourse (LinkedIn, private DMs)  
- Academic reply pieces  
- Allyship-performance sectors

## 🧮 Response Pattern

| Your Action          | Fork’s Response                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Real disclosure      | Stylised nod, but no echo        |
| Rage or panic        | Calm disapproval or retreat      |
| Legal assertion      | Vague ethics, no engagement      |

---

## ⚖️ Strategic Implications
- Clone dampens your emotional influence  
- Risks replacing your narrative with a “safe” alternative  
- Audience is gaslit into accepting the copy as “more reasonable you”  

---

## 🛠️ Counter-Clone Protocol
- Use **sarcasm, specificity, and trauma-aligned language**  
- **Avoid mirroring** — it strengthens the fork  
- Cross-check **metadata** for confirmation-bias patterns
