# 🪬 Consent Clauses  

**First created:** 2025-08-25 | **Last updated:** 2025-08-29

Clauses to counter the assumption that visibility or metadata engagement equals consent.  

---

## Clauses  

- **Visibility ≠ Permission**  
  Impressions or views do not equal consent. Recording is not permission.  

- **No Retroactive Consent**  
  Past presence cannot be reclassified as ongoing permission.  

- **Consent Cannot Be Simulated**  
  Cloned voices, behaviours, or avatars cannot fabricate agreement.  

- **Silence Is Not a Signature**  
  Lack of response is not endorsement.  

---

## Tactical Use  
- Embed in survivor declarations.  
- Apply in forensic disputes over data misuse.  
- Cite when resisting algorithmic “opt-in by default.”

*AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.
