## 🏮 Usage Layer — Lantern Guide  

This folder is designed as an **operational refusal kit**.  
Each file provides **syntax, clauses, and countermeasures** for when containment systems attempt to:  

- Publish without consent  
- Classify without care  
- Extract metadata without permission  
- Clone or fork survivor narrative  

📖 *Rule of thumb:* If you are unsure which file to open, follow the lantern.  
- **Syntax files** = language tools.  
- **Defense files** = forensic refusals.  
- **Fork files** = counter-clone protocols.

🌹 *Containment thrives on silence.  
These clauses guarantee you won’t give it that.*
