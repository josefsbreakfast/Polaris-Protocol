## 🎯 Purpose  

This folder collects **language, refusal syntax, and metadata clauses** that directly resist containment logics.  
Each file offers a different tactical register:  

- **Reclamation** → authorship recovery and reversal declarations.  
- **Survivor Syntax** → refusal phrases for those misclassified or ghosted.  
- **Metadata Defense** → forensic sovereignty and data refusal.  
- **Ghost Fork Response** → analysis of clone behaviour and counter-protocols.  
- **Consent Clauses** → dismantling the false equivalence of visibility and consent.  
- **Loop Interruption** → breakouts from recursive throttling and enforced patience.

## 🏮 Footer  

*AntiContainment Clauses* is a living node of the Polaris Protocol.  
Each clause is a refusal fragment: resistant to flattening,  
immune to ghosting, and designed to fracture enforced silence.
