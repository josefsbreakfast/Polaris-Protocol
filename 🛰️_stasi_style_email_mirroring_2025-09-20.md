# 🛰️ STASI-Style Email & Mirroring Concerns — Field Log (2025-09-20)
**First created:** 2025-09-20 | **Last updated:** 2025-09-20
*Field log recording user observations about email mirroring, DNS-level stalling, eSIM cloning, mailbox mirroring, and the operational implications for UK surveillance visibility and attribution.*

---

## Factual summary (events & observations)
- **Event date:** 2025-09-20
- **Context:** User reports recurring incidents of interference, deletions, and unusual content visibility patterns. The user observed that self-to-self emails and certain messages appear not to traverse UK servers (stall at DNS level) and hypothesises mailbox mirroring, eSIM cloning, or DNS manipulation as potential mechanisms that could prevent UK-centralised surveillance from seeing them.
- **Specific technical hypotheses from user:**  
  - Self-addressed emails that avoid UK servers due to DNS routing choices or local MX configuration.  
  - Mailbox mirroring or unauthorized mailbox access (server-side or via backups) enabling remote reading without device compromise.  
  - eSIM or SIM cloning enabling interception or redirection of communications and recovery/verification messages.  
  - DNS-level throttling or blocking so certain messages never appear in UK monitoring pipelines.  
  - Combinations of local physical access and remote cyber intrusion (hybrid vectors).

## Non-evidentiary contextual notes (user reflection)
- The user notes that these patterns make it plausible that UK surveillance/authorities might not see all communications if those messages never hit UK-controlled infrastructure. This complicates attribution and detection for domestic agencies.  
- The user emphasises that multiple actors (state, organized crime, local operators) could implement similar methods; the priority is identifying and patching systemic vulnerabilities rather than premature attribution.

## Investigatory leads / immediate preservation steps (recommended)
1. **Preserve copies of affected messages and metadata** — capture raw headers, full message source (including SMTP/Received headers), timestamps, and any routing metadata. Use "Export original" functions in webmail or client to get full headers. Screenshot the message and header view as backup.
2. **Collect device and account logs** — sign-in history, IP addresses, OAuth tokens, mailbox forwarding rules, connected apps, and admin logs for email hosting (if using a hosted provider). Export logs where possible. Note times and timezones precisely.
3. **Check MX/DNS records and routing** — capture current DNS/MX records for affected domains, TTLs, and any recent changes (use `dig` or online DNS lookup tools; preserve output). Record any unusual mail-exchanger entries.
4. **Contact telecoms / mobile provider** — ask about eSIM activity, SIM swaps, or unusual provisioning events on your number. Request confirmation of the devices/SIMs provisioned and dates/times of any changes.
5. **Investigate mailbox backups / mirroring** — check server-side mailbox rules, automated backups, and third-party backup services that might replicate mailboxes outside expected jurisdictions.
6. **Preserve sync/backup logs** — for cloud storage and mail clients (e.g., LastSync times, Dropbox/Google Drive activity) to detect deletions or external access.
7. **Create a chained timeline** — document each observed deletion, disappearance, unusual amplification, or suspicious access along with correlating events (git commits, upload times, platform moderation actions). Store this in Field Logs with SHA256 fingerprints for each preserved artifact.
8. **Consider a forensic image** — if legal action or formal investigation is planned, create forensic disk images of affected devices (use specialists) rather than overwriting or continuing to use devices.
9. **Legal / regulatory steps** — consider SARs (Subject Access Requests) to email providers, FOIs to public bodies, and letters to ISPs requesting logs; preserve correspondence and receipts.

## Practical mitigations (short-term)
- Change passwords on affected accounts using a secure device; enable hardware-backed 2FA (e.g., security keys) where possible.  
- Consider moving sensitive drafting to an air-gapped device or an encrypted offline document until preserved appropriately.  
- Avoid re-uploading or republishing potentially sensitive material until copies and hashes are secured.  
- Use a different communications channel (signal, protonmail) for coordination with trusted contacts; assume prior accounts may be compromised.  
- Contact your mobile provider to freeze SIM changes until anomalies are resolved.

## Attribution caution
- These observations and hypotheses are **not** evidence of a specific actor (state or otherwise). They are investigatory leads reflecting plausible technical mechanisms. For attribution you will need forensic traces (server logs, carrier records, device images) and corroborating intelligence.

## Suggested next steps (research & escalation)
1. **Preserve artifacts now** (see steps above). Time-sensitive logs may be overwritten by normal rotation.  
2. **Engage a digital forensic specialist** if you suspect serious compromise — they can safely create images and extract headers, logs, and indicators of compromise.  
3. **Consider making SAR/FOI requests** for communications metadata held by providers or public bodies.  
4. **Coordinate with trusted legal counsel** before pursuing public allegations or releases that reference named individuals or organisations.
